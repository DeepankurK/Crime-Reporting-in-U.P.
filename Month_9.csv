Lucknow,Leprosy drug to treat cancer? Doctors hunt for new uses of old medicines,"NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Can a leprosy tablet priced at Rs 2 each be the ‘miracle cure’ to treat blood-cell cancer? Or can expensive injections given to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women be replaced with a pill that costs as little as Rs 100 for a month’s supply? These are some of the questions Indian scientists have set out to answer as they look towards repurposing ‘old’ drugs as affordable treatments for new diseases. Repositioning of old drugs is an attractive proposition given substantial costs and the slow pace of new drug discovery and development. Sample this: To successfully launch a prescription drug in the US after taking it through preclinical studies and clinical trials requires $2.6 billion on an average and takes 12 years. And what are the chances of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving the drug? Only 14%. In contrast, existing drugs have already been shown to be safe in patients and if they can be used to treat other diseases, it can reduce drug development costs. It can also help meet the growing demand for new drugs, especially in developing countries like India which currently depend on advanced nations to come up with new drugs and launch them in their markets. Using drugs originally meant for one condition for treatment of another is not a new concept. Viagra, a little blue pill prescribed to men all over the world for erectile dysfunction, was actually supposed to treat chest pain or discomfort due to coronary heart disease. Minoxidil was developed to treat ulcers but is now used to treat hair loss. Aspirin, one of the most widely used drugs in the world, originally meant to ease inflammation and pain is now also used to treat and prevent heart attacks and strokes. Indian doctors are also sifting through old drugs to find new uses and cheaper alternatives to current treatments. At the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, scientists have recently found that certain leprosy drugs might help treat myeloma, a type of blood cancer. Sabyasachi Sanyal, a researcher at CDRI, in collaboration with clinical haematology department of King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, screened FDA-approved drugs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells and found that a leprosy drug — clofazimine, priced at Rs 2 per tablet — was a potent inhibitor of these cells. Sanyal's colleague and chief scientist at CDRI, Lucknow, Dr Naibedya Chattopadhyay, screened a library of over 1,000 clinically approved drugs with the aim to discover an oral substitute for teriparatide — an injectable given to women suffering from post-menopausal osteoporosis. “Our pre-clinical studies found that Pentoxifylline, a drug prescribed for the treatment of a disease of peripheral artery also referred to as intermittent claudication, when given to osteoporotic female rabbits mimicked all the skeletal effects of teriparatide including restoration of bone mass, strength, micro-structure and quality,” Dr Naibedya told TOI. While the minimum treatment cost with teriparatide is Rs 7,000 per month, treatment with pentoxifylline would cost Rs 100 per month, said Naibedya. “Moreover, since pentoxifylline does not require refrigeration, post-menopausal women having no access to a refrigerator will also benefit from the treatment,” he said. Researchers, however, added that both clofazimine and pentoxifylline were yet to undergo human trials for their new indication. If proven successful in human trials, the potential benefits are huge. The cost of launching a repurposed drug is approximately 85% less than that incurred on launching a new drug, according to Dr Naibedya. “Strategic repurposing of old drugs for new uses can save time as their pharmacology formulation and potential toxicity are already available. In the US, this strategy typically includes a demonstration of its efficacy in in vitro or in vivo animal model systems for new indications and then filing an investigational new drug application with the FDA, where following approval it typically enters into human trials,” he said. Doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, are also conducting clinical trials on repurposed drugs. Dr Kameshwar Prasad, professor of neurology at AIIMS, recently wrote to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to set up a task force to identify and validate low-cost alternatives to expensive drugs. Dr Prasad said that doctors are already prescribing certain cheaper therapies in place of expensive drugs in some cases. For instance, a single cycle immune therapy for treatment of the Guillain-Barre-Syndrome (GBS), an acute inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system, currently costs between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 8 lakh. To those who can’t afford it, physicians are recommending steroids that cost less than Rs 5,000 and are equally affective. “One of our residents, Dr Bhavna Kaul, recently conducted a survey of physicians across India to assess the use of cheaper alternatives for GBS. We were surprised to find that most physicians and neurologists were prescribing them since the standard treatment, in this case immunoglobin, was not affordable. They also claimed that the response of patients was satisfactory,” he added. In Bengaluru as well, a pharmaceutical company is studying the impact of a type 2 diabetes drug on cardiovascular diseases. The significance of repurposing drugs is considerable. Global spending on medicines is predicted to reach $1.4 trillion in 2020. Drug repositioning can help curb expenditure while safeguarding access to quality healthcare. But roadblocks remain. New indications for a drug need huge investment to move from ‘proof of concept’ to registered therapeutic use. Many times, researchers lack funding to undertake clinical trials and pharmaceutical companies can be disinterested in repurposing generic drugs as it would fetch them little financial returns, experts said. Like in Australia, Canada or Europe, India does not offer patent protection for new uses of known drugs. Experts said that companies which hold a current patent for a medicine could invest in the discovery of additional indications. But if pharmaceutical companies aren’t interested, governments could step in. Dr Naibedya said that financial support from the government could help teaching institutions conduct clinical trials of drugs that can be repurposed. “Successful public-funded demonstration of efficacy of a repurposed drug in clinical trials approved by the Drug Controller General of India may pave the way for far more affordability where the patients do not have to bear the burden of extra cost of development by the industry.” "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad flyover opened in May still without power line for its lights,"Ghaziabad: Vasundhara flyover was commissioned in May and inaugurated in June but the city’s civic agencies have cared little for it since, evident in the flyover remaining draped in darkness because it is yet to receive the power connection needed for its streetlight poles. Motorists headed towards Mohan Nagar on the Link Road have often complained that the flyover is difficult to spot from a distance because the streetlights don’t function in the entire area, leading to sharp manoeuvres near the approach that increase the possibility of an accident. However, the two agencies that constructed the flyover, the UP Bridge Corporation and Ghaziabad Development Authority, have failed to react to these concerns. Vasundhara flyover is used by thousands of commuters every day and should not have been opened without light connections, commuters said. “The city’s roads are already unsafe because there is no enforcement of traffic rules and faulty designs,” said Alok Kumar, president, of the Federation of Apartment Owners Association (FedAOA). “The least we expect from government departments and agencies is that they should at least try and make roads safe through a proactive approach. A case in point is the unlit Vasundhara flyover,” added Kumar. Vaishali resident Anish Kumar has just obtained a learner’s licence. “About a week ago, I had gone to Mohan Nagar for some work and while returning, it had become dark. I drove on to Vasundhara flyover where, barring the red tail lights of vehicles, the stretch was completely dark. It was difficult for me to drive as it was rush hour. For a moment, I felt like abandoning my car in panic,” he said. An official at the UP Bridge Corporation laid the blame on GDA’s doorstep. “We have installed 54 streetlights on both sides of the flyover and for a couple of days even used gensets to light it up as it was not connected to power lines,” said Ajay Singh, project manager. “We have completed our work and now it is for GDA to get a power connection from the electricity department. They have been informed about it,” added Singh. Asked why the flyover remained unlit, GDA’s chief engineer VN Singh said, “We have placed a request with the electricity department for proper power connections.” He said the lights would work “very soon” but did not specify a date. The 586-metre 6-lane flyover got completed on May 15 this year and was built at an estimated cost of Rs 65 crore. "
Kanpur,"Kanpur: Student cites own death to take leave, principal writes 'granted'","KANPUR: A class 8 boy sought leave from school, citing his own death in the application, which was shockingly approved by the principal without even giving it a read. Later, it came to fore that the boy, student of a private school in Kanpur's GT Road, inadvertently mentioned his own death, instead of his grandmother. While the boy skipped class to attend his grandma's funeral, the hilarious leave application went viral on social media. School sources confirmed his leave had indeed been sanctioned by the principal and it was an oversight. A school teacher, who shared the content of the letter, told TOI, the student of class 8 in his leave application stated - Respected principal, I wish to say that today (August 20) at around 10 am, the applicant has passed away. So I request you to kindly grant me half-day leave. I shall be grateful to you for this favour. Thank you. And the principal without going through the content wrote - Granted - and affixed his signature in red ink. The gaffe soon became the talk of the town after a school insider leaked the leave application and shared it on social media, triggering a flurry of comments, both humorous and caustic. Many expressed anger at the school principal's irresponsibility and demanded his sacking. "
Lucknow,"LMC's anti-dengue drive fizzles out, Lucknow feels sting","LUCKNOW: Dengue is gradually spreading its tentacles in the city, but preventive measures by civic authorities seem to be far from satisfactory. A TOI reality check found sanitation is pathetic in Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Chinhat, New Haidarganj, Khadra and Balaganj localities where dengue cases have been reported in last two months. As per norms, the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) and district health department are required to take extra precaution in areas where cases of vector-borne disease have been reported. The activities include surveys in households for larvae of aedes aegypti which is a carrier of dengue virus, spreading awareness on how to check mosquito breeding, carrying out anti-larvae spray at open spaces and drains followed by fogging and cleaning of garbage and stagnant water. Times ViewCivic agencies should launch fogging drives more aggressively to rein in the spread of dengue. A vector-borne disease, dengue mainly spreads during the monsoon season between July and October. Coordinated efforts by LMC and health department helped in limiting its spread in July, as only six new dengue cases were reported in the month. However, as the authorities slipped up, 17 patients were afflicted by the disease in August. Not just authorities, but citizens should also take necessary precautions to keep dengue at bay.In Indiranagar and Chinhat, where three dengue cases have been reported, puddles can be seen on the streets after rain, dumping grounds are mostly filled with garbage and drains are choked. In Gomtinagar, water from broken pipelines, flower pots and desert coolers has accumulated in the residential complex of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Similarly, in Gomtinagar's Vibhav Khand area, rainwater collected in empty vessels and drums used for construction activity are providing an environment conducive to breeding of mosquitoes. Naresh Vishwakarma of Vibhav Khand, one of whose neighbours was among dengue patients, said residents of the locality were living in fear. ""Health department officials carried out anti-larvae spraying at the dengue patient's house and left the entire locality. No fogging has taken place this year,"" he said. ""Besides the 28-year-old man who was diagnosed with dengue, at least 10 people of our locality are suffering from fever but no health officer has visited us,"" he added. Stinking piles of garbage, open drains and stagnant water are common in New Haidarganj, Khadra and Balaganj. Rakesh Raman of Balaganj said, ""We have complained to LMC twice demanding fogging in our area but nothing was done."" Additional chief medical officer Dr DK Bajpai said, ""Action will be taken against officials if they are not following the standard protocol. Source reduction and anti-larvae spray should be done in houses which lie within the 50-metre periphery of the spot where a dengue case is reported."" "
Lucknow,Chinhat pesticide unit owner booked after 25 buffaloes die,"LUCKNOW: A day after 25 buffaloes died under mysterious circumstances in Chinhat and 11 others fell ill, police registered a case against the owner of a pesticide factory in the area on Saturday. Taking cognizance of the incident, Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) rushed a team of scientists to collect water samples from the stretch of Gomti river. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board also sent samples to laboratory to find reason for bovine deaths. Chinhat SHO, Sachin Singh said a case has been lodged against Vishal Swarup Agarwal, owner of India Pesticide Limited, on complaint of a villager, Ramakant. The complaint said that 42 buffaloes from Tara Ka Purwa village had gone to graze along a drain in Devsthan locality, Chinhat, around 11am on Friday. “The buffaloes started falling unconscious after drinking water from the drain. The effluents from factory discharged into the drain probably contained some poisonous substance. We found 25 buffaloes dead and 11 seriously ill. We shifted the ill ones to veterinary hospital. Several buffaloes are still missing. We suspect their disappearance is an attempt to cover up crime,” he said. Locals complained of irritation and nausea after the incident. “A putrid smell from the drain has spread to even far away colonies,” the residents said. “We have collected samples to test toxicity and pollutants in water,” said IITR director, Prof Alok Dhawan. “We will take action once test reports come,” said Gomtinagar CO, Avnishwar Chandra Srivastava.

Lucknow,‘Shahjahanpur girl’s friend suspect in extortion case’,"LUCKNOW: UP Police on Friday said that 23-year-old man who was found in company of Shahjahanpur law student n Rajasthan’s Dausa was one of the suspects in the extortion case involving former Union minister Chinmayanand. Sanjay Singh was brought along with the girl to the Supreme Court. Both students are alumni of Swami Shukdevanand Law college, whose chairman is Chinmayanand. UP Police said they were trying to explore legal options whether Singh could be arrested yet as the SC has asked the girl to stay at a Delhi shelter home till her parents join her while adjourning the hearing in the matter till September 2. Sources in UP Police said that the Whatsapp message, demanding Rs 5 crore, was sent to Chinmayanand, obtaining a QR code by generating a PIN on a SIM belonging to someone else. The number used to send extortion message was 860420**** on August 22 at 12:53 PM. “The extortion message used technique of copying a QR code and scanning it. We have enough evidence to show that Sanjay left this mobile phone after sending extortion message and travelled to Delhi and other locations, ” said a top UP Police official. Though Chinamayand was not available for any comment, his lawyer Om Singh, on whose complaint the FIR was registered against the owner of 860420**** number, said that they would continue to seek charges of criminal intimidation against the girl’s friend. He though refused to comment on the video posted by girl on Facebook, where she has accused Chinmayanand of sexual harassment. “The abduction case against Chinmayanand now doesnt hold any ground as the girl has been recovered from Rajasthan in company of her friend, who is accused of extortion. I was the one who approached UP Police with an FIR on behalf of Chinmayanand ji. I did not reveal his name in the FIR but mentioned his number. The girl’s father had registered an FIR after our FIR. I cannot comment why the girl posted the video against my client,” Om Singh told TOI. Singh also said that Chinamayand had conveyed to him that the former Union minister has gone on a threeday maun vrat. "

Ghaziabad,"Swachh star Ghaziabad slips up, stares at rankings fall","GHAZIABAD: For two consecutive years, Ghaziabad has been the star performer in the Swachh Bharat rankings, finishing at 13th spot on the national index in 2019 from 351st in 2017. The improvement was visible everywhere, from clean roads to even footpaths and manicured parks. But this dream run could very well end in the next Swachh Bharat exercise in 2020 because of glaring gaps that have crept into its infrastructure and maintenance. A Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) official said the district’s performance has left much to be desired in some key Swachh Bharat parameters, and in some areas, gains made over the past two years were being negated. For instance, there is very little progress so far this year in creating awareness among residents. Residents’ complaints on the Swachhata app are not being redressed.  “The Centre has this time changed the format to determine Swachh rankings. It has introduced a league stage and the performance is being monitored directly by it for three quarters — April-June, July-September and October-December,” explained the official, adding, “200 marks are allocated as for performance in these three quarters and it is here that we stand to lose.” Till this time last year, the civic body had organised around 300 workshops involving residents to create awareness. “Till August, less than 30 workshops have been organised. Complaints raised by residents on the Swachhata app have crossed 1 lakh with little or no redress at all,” an official said. During Swachh Survekshan 2019, a total of only 40,000 complaints were registered on the Swachhata app. The GMC, during the last two Swachh Survekshan exercises, had also constructed 222 community toilets. “As of now, 22% of these toilets are closed for want of manpower, power connection and lack of sewer and water connections,” the official said. The waste processing and disposal mechanism has also been disrupted since the Pratap Vihar landfill was closed on the orders of an NGT committee on solid waste management. “A few days ago, GMC got 32 acres of land in Galand where it plans to develop a waste-to-energy plant but that is also going to take at least three years to get completed,” said the official. Earlier this month, Mayor Asha Sharma had convened a meeting of officials in which she spoke of these concerns. “As things stands now, it is unlikely we will be able to repeat the 2018 and 2019 performance unless we take strong measures,” Sharma admitted. “I have instructed officials to pull up their socks and start working in the right direction and ensure we perform even better than last year,” she added.

Kanpur,‘I dedicate my film to Uttar Pradesh’ Sanjay Dutt in Lucknow,"Itishree.Misra@timesgroup.com Sanjay Dutt, along with wife Maanayata, visited Lucknow to launch the title track of his latest film, recently. Giving him company were the other cast of the film including Lucknowite Ali Fazal, Satyajeet Dubey and Amyra Dastur. Walking in with confidence, leading the pack, Sanjay was in his elements while Ali was enjoying being home. In the press conference, Sanjay and Maanayata spoke about why they chose Lucknow to shoot the film 'Prassthanam' and what they like about the place. “Lucknow and Kanpur are my second homes and I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. Yahan ki tehzeeb, yahan ke log aur yahan ka khana toh sabse achha hai,” said Sanjay, adding, “We shot the film in Lucknow because it’s beautiful. It’s got that feel of India and culture which is what is reflected in our film. In fact, I dedicate Prassthanam to Uttar Pradesh.” Meanwhile Maanayata, who’s also producing the film, said, “I felt that Uttar Pradesh politics ka gadh hai and the backdrop of this film is politics. It could have been set in any environment but since the backdrop is politics, we felt UP was the best place to set the film in and shoot at. Yes, the subsidy that is provided by the state government is also one of the reasons why we shot here but certainly not just that. Basically it is the politics and the political backdrop that brought us here.” Ali, who belongs to Lucknow was all smiles at being home and when asked how he liked ot shoot here again, said, “Accha laga yahan shoot karna phir se. Ghar hai so I went home and met my mother. Lucknow bahut bada hissa hai iss film ka, kaafi iconic locations thin so it was good to be back home again.” (L-R) Ali Fazal, Sanjay Dutt, Maanayata Dutt, Amyra Dastur and Satyajeet Dubey in Lucknow (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)  (L-R) Ali Fazal, Sanjay Dutt, Maanayata Dutt, Amyra Dastur and Satyajeet Dubey in Lucknow (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) For Satyajeet, Lucknow holds a place of much importance as he confessed that three of the four films of his career had been shot in the city. “My film career began from Lucknow. In 2010 Ali and I shot 'Always Kabhi Kabhi', then I shot 'Kerry On Kutton' in Lucknow and because of that film, I got 'Prassthanam'. Of my four films, three have been shot here. So agar yeh alag desh hota toh shayad mujhe Lucknow ki citizenship mill jati,” said he. Counting his blessings, he went on to say, “This film is very different from what I have done till now and I hope I am able to get out of my sweet boy image with this film.” Sanjay off late has taken to playing elderly and fatherly characters on screen. When asked why, he replied in his candid way and said, “Shahrukh, Salman are not my contemporaries, I am senior to them. Jackie Shroff, Sunny Deol and me, we came together (in Bollywood), Salman and all came later on. But I choose to move on, because I think it is better.

Lucknow,‘I dedicate my film to Uttar Pradesh’ Sanjay Dutt in Lucknow,"Itishree.Misra@timesgroup.com Sanjay Dutt, along with wife Maanayata, visited Lucknow to launch the title track of his latest film, recently. Giving him company were the other cast of the film including Lucknowite Ali Fazal, Satyajeet Dubey and Amyra Dastur. Walking in with confidence, leading the pack, Sanjay was in his elements while Ali was enjoying being home. In the press conference, Sanjay and Maanayata spoke about why they chose Lucknow to shoot the film 'Prassthanam' and what they like about the place. “Lucknow and Kanpur are my second homes and I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. Yahan ki tehzeeb, yahan ke log aur yahan ka khana toh sabse achha hai,” said Sanjay, adding, “We shot the film in Lucknow because it’s beautiful. It’s got that feel of India and culture which is what is reflected in our film. In fact, I dedicate Prassthanam to Uttar Pradesh.” Meanwhile Maanayata, who’s also producing the film, said, “I felt that Uttar Pradesh politics ka gadh hai and the backdrop of this film is politics. It could have been set in any environment but since the backdrop is politics, we felt UP was the best place to set the film in and shoot at. Yes, the subsidy that is provided by the state government is also one of the reasons why we shot here but certainly not just that. Basically it is the politics and the political backdrop that brought us here.” Ali, who belongs to Lucknow was all smiles at being home and when asked how he liked ot shoot here again, said, “Accha laga yahan shoot karna phir se. Ghar hai so I went home and met my mother. Lucknow bahut bada hissa hai iss film ka, kaafi iconic locations thin so it was good to be back home again.” (L-R) Ali Fazal, Sanjay Dutt, Maanayata Dutt, Amyra Dastur and Satyajeet Dubey in Lucknow (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)  (L-R) Ali Fazal, Sanjay Dutt, Maanayata Dutt, Amyra Dastur and Satyajeet Dubey in Lucknow (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) For Satyajeet, Lucknow holds a place of much importance as he confessed that three of the four films of his career had been shot in the city. “My film career began from Lucknow. In 2010 Ali and I shot 'Always Kabhi Kabhi', then I shot 'Kerry On Kutton' in Lucknow and because of that film, I got 'Prassthanam'. Of my four films, three have been shot here. So agar yeh alag desh hota toh shayad mujhe Lucknow ki citizenship mill jati,” said he. Counting his blessings, he went on to say, “This film is very different from what I have done till now and I hope I am able to get out of my sweet boy image with this film.” Sanjay off late has taken to playing elderly and fatherly characters on screen. When asked why, he replied in his candid way and said, “Shahrukh, Salman are not my contemporaries, I am senior to them. Jackie Shroff, Sunny Deol and me, we came together (in Bollywood), Salman and all came later on. But I choose to move on, because I think it is better. And I choose to do things which suit me and that’s why I choose roles which I feel are closer to my real age.” Amyra, who was most of the time sitting quiet and smiling, said she had loved shooting in Lucknow. “I've loved Lucknow for of its feel, its people and the food.

Lucknow,Lucknow: IAS officer’s wife dies of bullet injury at her home,"LUCKNOW: The wife of an IAS officer posted in the city succumbed to a gunshot injury on Sunday afternoon. Police said, the family is claiming it to be a suicide. The 42-year-old mother of two was found soaked in blood on the sofa of her room minutes after she sent a ‘goodbye’ text to her husband present at their Vikalp Khand house in Gomtinagar along with their son and two domestic helps. The incident took place around 2.30pm. While the family has claimed suicide, police are probing “all angles”. No FIR was lodged till late on Sunday night. The family said that the woman was grappling with depression for a year and shot herself with her pistol. Her son, who was in an adjoining room, told police he heard a gunshot and rushed to find his father banging the door . The couple’s daughter was out of town. Police team later found a pistol next to the blood-soaked sofa, a bullet shell and a picture of Goddess Kali on the table.

Lucknow,Child-lifting rumours spur mob fury in UP,"LUCKNOW: Mob frenzy fuelled by rumours of child-lifting on social media continues to wreak havoc in the state with four people being attacked in 24 hours, taking the count of mob assault victims to 58 in 30 days, while one lost life in Sambhal last month. While four incidents were reported from eastern districts of Kushinagar, Deoria and Ballia, the scourge hit home in Lucknow too, where a man was brutally assaulted in upscale Aashiana on similar suspicion. In an apalling incident, an elderly couple was thrashed in Naurangiya area of Kushinagar on Sunday, while a 50-year-old woman was assaulted in Baghauch Ghat in Deoria district. Sixty-year-old Vineet Jaiswal and his wife, from Jaunpur, were thrashed by a mob in Akbarpur village, Nibua Naurangiya, Kushinagar, when some residents saw them talking to children. The elderly couple was being beaten black and blue, till some villagers called UP100, coming to rescue. Kushinagar, SP, Vinod Kumar Mishra, told TOI that Jaiswals had come to meet a relative, but were mistaken for child-lifters. There were two assaults in neighbouring Deoria district, where a 50-year-old woman, Kusuma, was thrashed by mob in Baghauch Ghat, while a 50-year-old man was also thrashed on child-lifting suspicion. Late Saturday, a teen girl working as a volunteer with an NGO faced mob fury near Sikandarpur bus station in Ballia and was brutally beaten after a woman, whom she tried to help, raised a false alarm. The teen was rescued by a policeman on picket duty. In Lucknow, SHO Aashiana, Vishwajeet Singh, said a group tried to lynch a mentally unstable man, but swift intervention by passersby saved him from the mob. Additional director general of police (law and order) PV Ramashastry told TOI that police teams are working to curb child-lifting rumours. “At village level, a S-10 team, including police and gram pradhan, has been constituted to spread awareness and quell rumours. In urban areas, digital volunteers are keeping vigil and all station house officers have been told to be alert,” he said. On Wednesday, state police chief also recommended slapping of NSA to curb mob violence. UP police social media cell said, child-lifting videos shared on social media are morphed and fake. A video from Pakistan, showing two bikers kidnapping a child was used to fuel rumours. This video was altered to trigger mob frenzy, said a senior official of UPP social media cell. In Hardoi district, reports of child-lifting rumours poured from Shahabad, Kachauna, Sandi, and Harpalpur police stations. In all incidents, youths tried to harass innocent people. Hardoi SP, Alok Priyadarshi, said five people have been arrested and National Security Act will be invoked.

Lucknow,UP: Triple talaq hurled from Saudi over Rs 5 lakh dowry,"LUCKNOW: A 30-year-old woman from Rae Bareli has accused her husband of four years of giving her triple talaq over phone from Saudi Arabia on Sunday for not being able to meet his dowry demand of Rs 5 lakh. Based on Reshma’s complaint, which also mentions torment by her in-laws, police have booked her husband Dilsher and six of his family members under the newly enacted law that deems instant talaq a punishable offence. According to the FIR, Reshma of Tilokpur Majre Atwa village in Naseerabad married Disher of the same village in 2015. “My husband wanted Rs 5 lakh in dowry and began mistreating me soon after the wedding. He often beat me up. He sometimes left home and didn’t return for months. In his absence, my in-laws Ruksana and Gaffar tortured me,” Reshma said in her complaint. Around 9pm on August 20, Dilsher called her from Saudi Arabia. He allegedly hurled expletives at her and then shouted triple talaq. “Next morning, his parents, brother and brother’s wife asked me to either get the money or get out of the house. I was thrashed with sticks. With no other option left, I returned to my parents’ home,” Reshma said in her complaint. Naseerabad station house officer JP Yadav said an FIR under Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, had been registered against Dilsher, his parents and three others who have also been booked under IPC section for criminal intimidation, provoking breach of peace, dowry harassment and causing hurt. So far, 250-plus triple talaq cases have been registered in UP, mostly in its western districts. In most of these cases, the reason behind talaq is dowry. There have also been instances where talaq was given over frivolous reasons like wife complaining to her father-in-law about husband’s drinking habit. In one case, a woman was given triple talaq for celebrating the passage of the bill. "

Lucknow,UP: SI cries assault after his car rams parked vehicle,"LUCKNOW: A police sub-inspector has accused two brothers of assaulting him in the small hours of Sunday, after he accidentally hit their parked car in Triveninagar, a charge the duo have vehemently denied and claimed that the cop used abusive language when stopped from fleeing. Two FIRs have been lodged at Hasanganj police station in connection with the incident. The brothers were arrested and released on bail. According to sub-inspector Naresh Pal, he was driving home from Vibhuti Khand police station around 1am when he inadvertently rammed his car into a parked vehicle while trying to save a cow that came in the way. The damaged car belonged to Avinash Mishra (36) and Shivam Mishra (25). ""They came out of their house, dragged me out of my car and assaulted me. I told them that I would pay for repairs, but they didn't listen. They even tried to snatch my service pistol,"" said Pal who has accused the brothers of voluntarily causing hurt, robbery and causing damage to his car. The sub-inspector added that the duo had snatched his phone when they saw him recording the incident. The phone was returned to him only after a police vehicle arrived on the spot and intervened. Shatrughan Prasad Mishra, father of Avinash and Shivam, has lodged a counter FIR against Pal for rash driving and causing damage to their car. He said the cop rammed their car around 11.45pm on Saturday. ""My sons went out and stopped him. There was a heated exchange and I dialled 100,"" Mishra said in the FIR.

Ghaziabad,Setting up illegal hoardings in Ghaziabad? You can be booked,"GHAZIABAD: The district administration has decided to file police complaints against people and firms who put up unauthorised advertisements in the city. Civic bodies like GDA, GMC and nagar palikas have been directed to conduct a survey of advertisements displayed on unipoles, foot overbridges (FOBs) and at the city entry points and submit a report to the district administration. Besides civic agencies, private firms which have been awarded tenders for advertisement have also been asked to provide details of the agreement, spots and durations for which they have been granted permission, as well as the revenue being generated through such spaces. The district magistrate’s (DM) office has also issued a format for filling up the details. The move comes close on the heels of GMC issuing notices to seven firms for violating the terms of agreement for putting up advertisements on FOBs in the city. The seven firms, which built FOBs under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model, allegedly didn’t provide ramps, lifts or escalators for disabled and elderly persons. The civic body, through the notices, said it would cancel the agreement and gave a week’s time to the firms to file replies. DM Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “This initiative has been taken to break the cartel where individuals and firms have even prepared forged papers and awarded themselves rights to put up advertisements in the city. They are akin to land mafia and strict action will be taken against them now.” “Likewise, the FOBs have lost their relevance and become the spots putting up commercials. Most of them do not have facilities like escalators or ramps. I have received several complaints about unauthorised billboards being put up at several places,” he added. The DM said the traffic wing and the regional transport office have also been roped in to identify the spots where hoardings and billboards are causing obstructions to the traffic. They will be removed on the recommendations of the two agencies, he added. Moreover, a committee has been constituted under a magistrate-level official which will tally the reports submitted by the civic bodies and the private firms and take action against encroachers. GMC officials said between 2010 and 2013, seven firms had been given permission to build and operate 19 FOBs in the city under the BOT model for 30 years. The firms were supposed to earn revenue by giving spaces to advertisements. Under the agreement, they were required to build ramps and provide lifts for elderly, sick and disabled persons. The companies, however, didn’t fulfil the norms and started giving spaces to advertisers without getting inspections done by an authorised agency. They have also not submitted a completion certificate with the department. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Cousin kills 40-year-old after fight between their kids,"GHAZIABAD: A 40-year-old man was stabbed to death by his cousin in Masuri’s Amipur Barela village on Saturday. According to the police, a heated argument between the cousins over a fight between their children led to the crime. “Sandeep and Deepak resided in the same area. On Saturday evening, their kids were playing in the locality when they got into a fight. Soon, the fathers — Sandeep and Deepak— intervened. They got into an argument. Deepak’s father Rampuri and a relative Zile Singh also joined Deepak and started accusing Sandeep. Soon, in a fit of rage Deepak stabbed Sandeep with a knife on his chest,” a relative told the police. Neighbours rushed Sandeep to a hospital in Modinagar where he died during treatment. Vinod, Sandeep’s brother, filed a complaint against Deepak, Rampuri and Zile Singh based on which an FIR was lodged at Masuri police station.  “Deepak was arrested on Sunday, while his father and relative — the co-accused in the case — are absconding,” an officer said.

Lucknow,Roti-salt meal: UP scribe booked for 'conspiracy',"LUCKNOW/VARANASI: UP Police have registered a case of criminal conspiracy against Mirzapur-based journalist Pawan Jaiswal, eight days after a video filmed by him showing students at a state-run school having roti with salt as their midday meal went viral on social media platforms. The FIR was lodged on Saturday on the complaint of block education officer Prem Shankar Ram against the reporter of a vernacular newspaper for ""defaming the state government"" with his video. A representative of gram pradhan Rajkumar Pal, who had invited the journalist to the school at Siyur in Mirzapur, and an unknown person were also named in the FIR. The charges slapped include criminal conspiracy, obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions, false evidence and cheating. Prem Shankar told TOI that the FIR followed an ""investigation"" by a three-member team led by Mirzapur chief development officer Priyanka Niranjan. The probe, he said, revealed that a proper meal had not yet been cooked. So, the video was purportedly shot to malign the Yogi Adityanath government. The FIR also states that the video was forwarded to a television news agency and circulated on social media. The journalist maintained he was discharging his professional duty by highlighting ""nutritional inadequacies"" in the midday meal. “I was told about the shortcomings and inadequacies in the midday meals served at a government school in Jamalpur block in Mirzapur. The issue pertained to meals for kids, which were limited to just salt and rice or salt and chapatis. On August 22, I alerted basic education officer Brajesh Kumar Singh about the shortcomings before reporting.” The police charges invoked strong reactions from the opposition parties. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav took to Twitter to hit out at the government for its “political encounter of a journalist who exposed corruption”. The Editors Guild of India described it as a “cruel and classic case of shooting the messenger”. The guild said: “It’s shocking that instead of taking action to fix what’s wrong on the ground, the government has filed criminal cases against the journalist.” "

Lucknow,MBA students at Lucknow University protest ‘sudden hike’ in semester fee,"LUCKNOW: Sixty students of the five-year integrated MBA course at Lucknow University were in for a shock on Monday when each of them was asked to pay Rs 45,000 more as tuition fee for their seventh semester. The MBA course for 10+2 students was launched in 2016. At the time of admission, the fee per semester mentioned in the brochure was Rs 30,000. For the first three years (six semesters), the entire batch paid the mentioned amount. However, they have now been asked to pay Rs 75,000 for each of the remaining semesters. “Out of the blue, we are being told to pay Rs 45,000 more. Officials are saying the fee mentioned in the brochure was for the first three years, equivalent to bachelor’s course or BBA. For the last two years (equivalent to master’s course or MBA), the fee is Rs 75,000 per semester,” said a student, requesting anonymity. Another said she had taken admission to this programme because it was within budget. “I may have to quit the course,” she added. Agitated students assembled outside the department and took out a march till the vice-chancellor’s office. Since the latter is out of town, they met pro vice-chancellor RK Singh. “A decision will be taken in the interest of students,” Singh later told TOI. "
Lucknow,"Contract intact, parking agencies fleece people","LUCKNOW: The municipal corporation’s decision to take back control of parking lots from Sunday has remained only on paper, leaving vehicle owners at the mercy of contractors who continue to fleece them. Swamped with complaints that private agencies, which were hired through auction, were charging more than the fixed parking rates and were allowing encroachment, the LMC had on July 29 proposed that it would revoke the contracts and resume control from September 1. The proposal was also approved by its executive committee on July 30. TimesViewCommuters seem to be bearing the brunt of red tape in Lucknow Municipal Corporation. If the LMC is unable to take immediate control of parking lots, it should at least ensure that private agencies hired by it do not fleece people or encroach upon parking space. Action can be taken on specific complaints lodged with the LMC grievance cell. Officials can also conduct surprise inspections or sting operations to nail unscrupulous contractors.However, a TOI reality check on Monday revealed that the plan was far from implemented. While the LMC prescribed four-hour parking rates are Rs 10 for two-wheelers and Rs 30 for four-wheelers, most vehicle owners at Jankipuram and Vibhuti Khand in Gomtinagar were paying double the amounts on weekends. “We cough up whatever we are asked to pay because there is no alternative parking space. If we park our vehicles on pavements, they will be towed away by the traffic police,” said Rahul Dhawan in Vibhuti Khand. In Mahanagar, the private contractors were themselves spotted encroaching on pavements. Commuter Himanshu Saini said: “Pedestrians like me are being compelled to walk on the carriageway because there is no room on footpaths. We are risking our life and limbs.

Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh: Private varsity law notified, govt gets regulatory power","LUCKNOW: From now on, no anti-national activity will be permitted in any private university in the state. The Uttar Pradesh Private Universities Act, 2019, which makes private universities culpable if any ‘anti-national’ activity takes place on their campus, has been notified and came into force on September 1. The Act, cleared by both Houses of UP legislature in July, gives the state government greater powers over private universities in the state. It covers the existing 27 private universities that have been given up to one year to incorporate the new regulations in their respective charters or frame new rules as per the Act. It will also cover all private universities coming up in future. The Act aims to bring uniformity in academic calendar, fee structure, besides ensuring that caste or religion will not be a ground for admission though the universities will be required to ensure quota for SC/ST, OBC and economically backward students and employees’ wards as per state government directives. While the government has not specified what it means by ‘anti-national’ activity, deputy CM and higher education minister, Dinesh Sharma, earlier told TOI, “Activity like those in Jawaharlal Nehru University would not be permitted.” In case of any breach of law, the Act empowers the government to take action against the university for violation of rules of establishment. No university can allow, be involved in or allow its name to be used in any anti-national activity. Among the key provisions of the Act, 10% of the total seats have been earmarked for reservation and students from economically weaker section will be charged 50% of the fee. Each university has to ensure that its fee structure is available in public domain. The Act also prohibits the sale, lease or transfer of the university land for any other purpose, though it can be mortgaged for construction purpose. The appointment of vice-chancellor can be done only in consultation with the governing body, while honorary degrees also cannot be handed out without state government’s prior approval. The state government will carry out annual inspections to ensure that rules are being followed, and in case of any violation, it can issue directions which will be mandatory for the university to follow. The government can also denotify a university if it is found misusing funds. "
Lucknow,UP: Demarcation of landfill sites in master plans,"LUCKNOW: Giving a leg up to the ambitious Swacch Bharat Mission, the Yogi Adityanath government has moved a proposal envisaging demarcation of landfill sites for municipal solid waste in the master plan of various cities in the state. The proposal forwarded by the state housing and planning department (TOI has a copy of it) points out that municipal solid waste landfill sites are not properly earmarked and hap-hazardously located. The waste is indiscriminately dumped, often leading to pollution of the ground and surface water reservoirs, the proposal says. The idea, which was mooted in 2014, could not gain much traction in the absence of proper guidelines. The state government has proposed that not only landfill sites, waste collection centres and transfer stations should also be earmarked in the master plan. This, the proposal says, will be in consonance with the municipal solid waste management manual and municipal solid waste rules of 2016, as envisaged in the Swacch Bharat Mission. The government has now framed rules for setting up of waste collection centres, transfer stations and landfill sites. According to the rules, waste collection centres should be set up in all cities where landfill sites are located 15 kms away from main city area. The rules categorically ban collection/transfer stations in wetlands and flood plains, sites where vegetation or wildlife is conserved, or places which have heritage sites, agricultural land and parks. The guidelines ban setting up of landfill sites or waste transfer stations within 200m from water bodies. In case of river, a minimum distance of 100m should be maintained and a bund be constructed between the landfill site and the river. According to rules, a waste transfer station be set up for every 2 lakh population and it should have the minimum area of 5000 square metres. Objections by the people should be taken into account while setting up any waste collection/transfer station. As for landfill site, it is proposed that an area of 1 hectare per 1 lakh of population be earmarked. The site should be big enough to cater to the needs for a period of 25 years. A ‘buffer zone’ of 15m is also proposed around the transfer station which should be used for plantation and landscaping so that residents do not get affected. "

Lucknow,UP: Rescued bonded labourers recall horror in factory,"LUCKNOW: When Salman Ali of Sitapur took up his first job as a labourer in a Pune-based jaggery factory two months ago, he thought he was free to choose the way he wanted to live. However, the 19-year-old man did not know that his new job would come with the burden of bonded labour. Salman was one of the 19 bonded labourers who were rescued from the factory on August 30 by two organizations – UP’s ActionAid and Pune-based Hamal Panchayat – in association with Pune district administration. The rescued labourers, including women and children, were kept in a remote factory in a pitiable condition and forced to work beyond the stipulated 12 hours, which sometimes went up to 18 hours. They were not paid and not allowed to venture out of the factory. Mohammad Arif (24) of Muzaffarnagar was the one who was reached out first for the job, and the first to blow the whistle which led to the rescue operation. “We lived in a small hut where rainwater seeped in. We were forced to work beyond duty hours, abused and thrashed,” he said. Regional manager, ActionAid, Khalid Chaudhry said: “Two persons have been arrested. The rescued labourers have been issued a ‘release certificate’ from the Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labour through the Pune administration.” He said the rescued labourers were eligible for compensation which was Rs 1 lakh for men and Rs 2 lakh for women. Recalling the harrowing time he had at the factory, Mohd Zeeshan (22) said: “I was thrashed for three days and kept in isolation as I dared to ask for my dues.” Rakesh, his wife Shakuntala and daughter Pooja from Saharanpur were also among rescued labourers. “My daughter’s marriage was scheduled on September 15. We were asked we will be granted leave 15 days prior to the wedding but they later retracted. Had it not been for this rescue, we would have been rotting there,” said Shakuntala. "
Lucknow,Bar code on doors for foolproof garbage collection in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: The City of Nawabs is all set to raise the bar as far as solid waste management is concerned. Drawing inspiration from Pune and under the Smart City project, the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) will introduce radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology so that bar codes can be used to ensure door-to-door garbage collection. The pilot project in Geetapalli ward will begin very soon, officials said. A bar code will be pasted outside every house and a sanitation worker will be required to scan the same using a smartphone after his/her daily duty. Scanning the bar code will send an instant alert to the LMC control room and is expected to go a long way in checking employee truancy. According to LMC officials, Geetapalli ward has around 49,000 households. The bar code installation work will take three days and the smart garbage collection service will begin soon thereafter. If the pilot project is successful, it will be extended to all the 110 wards under LMC. The civic body’s private partner Ecogreen deploys around 300 workers in every ward for daily door-to-door garbage collection. ?15-lakh fund to buy phones for workers Workers who don’t have a smartphone will be provided the same by LMC, which has earmarked Rs 15 lakh for the same.

Lucknow,"UP: Shopkeepers mock ban, use plastic bags on the sly","LUCKNOW: A blanket ban on plastic and an LMC warning on stringent penalties from September 1 notwithstanding, use of bags and articles made of the non-biodegradable material is common in the city. Under the Uttar Pradesh Plastic and Other Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Regulation) Act, 2000, which was amended in July 2018, disposable plastic and thermocol items such as bags, boxes, plates, glasses, spoons, forks and straws are banned. The authorities had last year promised to implement the law in letter and spirit. The LMC also planned to fine the common man from this month. But, the reality is different in prominent areas like Narhi, Lalbagh, Jankipuram, Dandaiya and Yahiyaganj. Shopkeepers here stock polythene bags, but keep a few cloth bags on shelves to mislead LMC officials. “LMC raids are ineffective. Most shopkeepers hide plastic bags in storerooms,” said Rajesh Saxena, a resident of Narhi. Shopkeepers in Dandaiya complained that polythene bags above 50 micron were not readily available in the market. “Also, there is no cheap alternative. What can we do?” said Indresh Gupta, a shopkeeper. Most sellers and buyers played the blame game. Jai Prakash, a tea vendor near Vivekanand Hospital, said polythene was the easiest option to pack and deliver chai. “Most vendors keep polybags.” According to LMC officials, they have seized plastic worth Rs 1.8 crore from the eight zones of the city so far and the crackdown will continue. “We are regularly conducting drives and the difference can be seen in the city. Our next aim is to put a stop to sale of polythene in big markets,” said additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh. "

Police said the arrested men did not know about the consignment that was being carried to Imphal from Delhi cantonment. The parts of the helicopters, deployed in border areas, had been sent to Delhi for an inspection. Police said the truck had left Delhi cantonment around 11pm on Friday. “An army personnel, Vishal, and a different driver were assigned the duty to accompany the vehicle, but they handed over the truck to driver Atul and helper Anil somewhere in Delhi and Vishal had asked them to pick him up from his house on the way,” said SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh.

Lucknow,CISH develops antidote to 'banana emergency',"LUCKNOW: At a time when a ""banana emergency"" has been declared in Columbia and other Latin American countries, parts of Asia, Africa and Australia, with the crop struck with a deadly disease that leads to wilting of the banana plant dangerously, the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) here has come up with a bio-formulant to save the crop. The disease ""fusarium oxysporum TR4"" or Panama Wilt is causing havoc for banana crop in these countries. ""The bio-formulant - ICAR fusicont -- is a mix fungi and bacteria that has succeeded in fighting the deadly disease known as Panama wilt 4, which could be of immense value in saving the largest crop in several countries,"" CISH director Shailendra Rajan told TOI after a two- day deliberation in Malihabad. With the crop area reaching 92 lakh hectares by last year, banana has been the most expanding crop of Uttar Pradesh which is threatening to overtake other states like Maharashtra, Bihar and West Bengal in terms of acerage and farmers evincing their interest in it. In terms of size, shape, weight and shelf value, banana of Uttar Pradesh is in high demand in other states. But in the last few years, a fungal disease has quietly gripped the crop in eastern UP - Gorakhpur, Kushinagar and other places in Bihar's Katihar and destroyed the crop to a large extent. Rajan said the disease creeped into UP farms through the Ghaghra, Gandak and Kosi rivers from Nepal and silently destroyed the crop, causing panic among banana cultivators. The disease is so challenging that once it grips a plant/crop, it is nearly impossible to be eradicate, said Rajan. It attacks roots and blocks the plant's vascular system. Like other soil-dwelling strains, TR4 cannot be controlled using fungicides and fumigants, he added. Spot inspection and laboratory tests and two-year-long investigations confirmed that it is the same ""fusarium"" epidemic which has led to the declaration of ""banana emergency"" in the Latin American countries and farmers in Asia, Africa and Australian continents were also struggling against this. "" After Centre's nod, CISH will get into commercial production on PPP model,"" he said. "

The rate hike for 301-500 slab is the least, rising from Rs 6.20 per unit to Rs 6.50. Consuming more than 500 units would also be costlier, increasing from Rs 6.50 to Rs 7.00 per unit. The commission has also hiked monthly fixed charge from Rs 100 per kilowatt/month to Rs 110 but has has given respite by discontinuing the monthly surcharge of 4.28% on bills. The power tariff is being hiked after almost two years as it was shelved in 2018 in the run up to general elections. Tariff has been increased for rural consumers also by around 25% for unmetered and 10% for metered connections. The unmetered consumers will now have to pay Rs 500 per kW/month instead of Rs 400. Tariff for life line consumers having 1 kW load, however, remains unchanged at Rs 3 per unit. Consumers having metered connections will pay Rs 3.35 per unit instead of Rs 3 for up to 100 units. The tariff for 100- 150 slab has been hiked from Rs 3.50 to Rs 3.85 per unit, and for 151-300 slab from Rs 4.50 per unit to Rs 5. Consumption between 301 and 500 units would be charged at Rs 5.50 per unit instead of Rs 5, while consumers will have to pay Rs 6 per unit instead of Rs 5.50 for units beyond 500. Tariff for industries has also been raised from Rs 6.65 per unit to Rs 7.10, while the demand charge has been increased from Rs 250 per KVA to Rs 300. UPERC said tariff rise became necessary as expenditure has gone up. The fixed cost of power plants has increased due to revised operation and maintenance norms, while coal price has also gone up over last few years, increasing cost by approximately 10-14 paise per unit.

Kanpur,UP softens stand: MDM row scribe won’t be held,"LUCKNOW/KANPUR: The UP government on Tuesday softened its stand in Mirzapur midday meal (MDM) controversy as its two ministers, heading higher and basic education departments, insisted that the FIR with criminal conspiracy charges against the vernacular reporter was not the final probe report. The two ministers spoke at different places, hinting that the local journalist would not be arrested. UP basic education minister Satish Dwivedi, who took charge recently after the cabinet reshuffle, expressed dissatisfaction against registration of FIR against journalist Pawan Jaiswal. Jaiswal and village head’s aide Rajkumar Pal were booked on late Sunday under charges of criminal conspiracy, obstruction to government officials and cheating in the incident involving filming of students having roti with salt — an inadequate meal according to Centre’s 400 calorie intake specification — at a government school in Siyur village on August 22. “There should be no probe for exposing corruption. If there’s such action, I would seek a report on what happened. The action was taken by UP Police and is not related to my department directly. However, I will seek the details on the sequence of the day’s incidents from the district SP,” Dwivedi told reporters in Basti. UP deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who heads the higher education department, gave broad hints at re-evaulating the charges levelled against Jaiswal. “The government does not behave with a prejudiced mind against anyone. If there is anyone innocent, the government will not take any action against that person,” said Sharma in Kanpur. He, however, said the initial probe has indicated a clear conspiracy by Pal, midday meal officials and a few others. Mirzapur administration officials, including DM Anurag Patel, have so far maintained that Pal and Jaiswal had spoken to each other on the day of filming the school kids having namak-roti meal. The administration said the village head and teaching staff are entrusted task of replenishing vegetables but conspired to defame the state government. Patel on Tuesday raised a fresh concern, saying that Jaiswal, despite representing a print media, carried a camera to film the students. “Doing a news report is not with this procedure. In an audio conversation, which has been supplied by the reporter himself, the village head’s aide is clearly instructing him to visit the school and make the video. His job was to find the missing stocks, not do a recording and defame the governemnt,"" said Patel. Earlier in the day, Mirzapur journalists assembled outside district administration offices to protest against the case against Jaiswal. "

Lucknow,Mulayam Singh Yadav makes a comeback to defend veteran Azam Khan,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav accused the Yogi government of implicating party leader Azam Khan in false cases and vowed to launch a mass agitation. In a choked voice, Mulayam said, “Azam hailed from a poor family and built Jauhar University by begging from the public and his friends in India and abroad. He turned into a national leader and that’s why the BJP government is targeting him.” It was after an interregnum that Mulayam addressed a press conference and the way he raised Azam Khan’s trauma, showed his emotional bonding with the SP veteran, who’s in trouble for his alleged illegal construction in the Rampur university and embroiled in land grab cases. “For just two bighas of land outside his university, he has been slapped with over 70 criminal cases. His family members, including women are being harassed and booked in criminal cases. Some BJP ministers too admitted in private that injustice was being done to Azam. Police raided homes of his family and interrogated them. What was their crime,” he asked. Warning the BJP government of a mammoth agitation, Mulayam said he would summon a meeting of party cadre and decide on the future course of action in a few days.  Seeking help media’s help to fight the BJP government’s injustice against Azam, Mulayam recalled how he had been booked by Congress governments and faced imprisonment of nearly three months, but emerged unscathed. “Azam is being targeted by the Yogi government and he will prove his innocence. If needed, I will meet PM Narendra Modi,” he said. Deflecting questions other than Azam, the SP patron said this was the most burning issue and he would launch a mass movement. "
Lucknow,Woman shooter heckles Ayodhya Muslim litigant,"AYODHYA: Iqbal Ansari, a key litigant from the Muslim side in the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, was allegedly attacked in his Ayodhya residence on Tuesday afternoon. Police said the accused included an ""international"" woman shooter and her male associate. Ansari told the police that a woman approached his security guard at around 1 pm and introduced herself as shooter Vartika Singh and wanted to meet him. She kicked off her discussion on triple talaq and Ayodhya and within minutes grew violent, the litigant said in his police complaint. Vartika and her male associate were detained, but later escorted to Lucknow. Police are yet to register an FIR. Talking to TOI, Ansari said, ""The woman asked me to withdraw the claim on the title suit and threatened to shoot me if I didn't comply. The woman and her male associate suddenly lunged at me. If policemen guarding me hadn't intervened, I would have been grievously injured. They blamed me for not allowing the construction of a Ram mandir. I told them there are hundreds of temples in Ayodhya and I was not opposed to any temple."" When sparks flew, Ansari's guard, constable Mohammad Tahir, jumped to his rescue. Talking to TOI, Tahir said, ""The woman suddenly got up and charged at him. Had there been a delay on my part, the woman would have inflicted injuries on Ansari. The man accompanying her was also assisting her in the attack."" After Vartika Singh reached Lucknow, she told TOI on the phone that she had indeed attacked Ansari. ""When he told me that Ayodhya will be turned into Pakistan and a temple won't be built, I slapped him."" "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Shots fired after feud in college, two students hurt","GHAZIABAD: A fight between two groups of students at MM degree college in Ghaziabad’s Modinagar took a terrifying turn when one amongst them fired gunshots, injuring two students on Tuesday. Police said that both the victims were admitted to a nearby hospital and are in a stable condition. At 11.30 am, Sumit (20), a resident of Nand Nagri, and Kapil alias Nikhil (19) from Meerut, were on the way to their classroom after parking their vehicles when the crime took place, police said. Around 50 metres away from the college gate, Sagar, a BA first year student, stopped the two and a heated argument ensued between them. “All of a sudden, Sagar pulled out a country-made pistol from his pocket and opened fire, in which Sumit and Nikhil got injured,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, SP (rural) told TOI. Abhishek Kumar, a student, said he was going to his classes when he heard gunfire sounds. “I heard four shots after I reached the area between the two colleged buildings. I found two students lying in a pool of blood. Other students and college staffers also started gathering and police were informed by the school staff,” he said. Sanjeev Kumar Sharma, SHO (Modinagar) said, “Sumit sustained a bullet injury to his abdomen and was referred to Kailashi hospital. Nikhil had an injury in his hand and was admitted to a hospital in Modinagar,” said Sharma. Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate, and Sudhir Kumar Singh, senior superintendent of police reached the spot. “Prima facie, it seems an ex-student had opened fire on the boys. He managed to flee the spot. We are conducting raids,” the SSP said. There has been no complaint in the incident so far, police said. "

Ghaziabad,NCLT directs insolvency proceedings against IHC,"GHAZIABAD: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has appointed an insolvency resolution professional to initiate insolvency proceedings against the Indirapuram Habitat Centre — a shopping centre in Ahimsa Khand. The announcement to appoint Pawan Kumar Goyal as the IRP came through an order dated August 22. The IHC, which is the corporate debtor in the case, was incorporated in 2002 and the property sold to around 2,000 allottees. Of them, around 300 were handed over shops and commercial spaces. The NCLT order came after Dimand Trimax, a real estate investor, raised an insolvency bid against IHC under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (2016) for non-payment of a loan worth Rs 32 crore. The insolvency proceedings against the company have been initiated from August 26 and all allottees have been given time till September 9 to claim their stakes as financial creditors. Lawyers representing buyers of commercial space at IHC said the developer had sold shops and then mortgaged them for further funding. The buyers as well as those who have lent money on the basis of this mortgage are now party to the insolvency proceedings. “While the buyers are the main claimants of the property, those who have lent money on the basis of the mortgage will also stake claim to their investments. Now, the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has to take responsibility for their role in the matter,” said Tarun Tandon, an advocate representing a section of IHC buyers. IHC has been facing problems with the GDA as well. On July 5, the development agency had sealed the IHC premises over non-payment of property tax to the tune of Rs 49 crore despite several reminders. This case dates back to 2007, when GDA had sold about 12 acres to the retail hub developer for Rs 100 crore, of which it had deposited only Rs 25 crore. The matter dragged on for several years and in January 2017, the IHC developer offered a one-time settlement to the GDA, which the development agency accepted. The GDA had in October 2017 sealed a portion of the IHC. However, a month after the sealing, the retail hub developer approached the Allahabad high court, and was directed to deposit Rs 70 crore with the development agency. Of the 12 acres that GDA had sold to the IHC developer, the centre came up on four acres and construction is being carried out on the remaining eight. In 2014, the Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association had filed a petition in the high court claiming that the GDA had “arbitrarily” changed the land use of the area in the Master Plan 2021. However, the GDA had managed to convince the court that there was no wrongdoing in this. (With inputs from Abhijay Jha)"
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Woman stages son’s kidnap, held with lover","GHAZIABAD: A woman has been arrested for allegedly staging the kidnap of her five-year-old son so that she could elope with her lover. Three others, including the woman’s lover and a friend with whom she had kept the child, have been arrested from Khoda area. The accused have been identified as Zenab, mother of the boy, her friend Komal, lover Salman and Komal’s mother-in law, Sunita. Police said preliminary investigations showed that Zenab had kept her son with Komal so that she could tell her husband that their son had been kidnapped by a child-lifter. Earlier too, Zenab had told her husband she wanted to marry Salman, but the husband had sought time for divorce as their son was growing up. By staging the kidnap of the child, Zenab allegedly planned to tell her husband Shahrukh that now that their son was no longer with them, he should give her divorce. Zenab even approached the cops and cooked up a story to lodge a kidnap complaint. She apparently planned to take her son with her a few days after she had eloped with Salman. Police had found Zenab’s statements suspicious and put her phone on surveillance. “She wanted to take advantage of child-lifting rumours. The location of her phone was traced to Delhi,” SN Singh, the Ghaziabad SP. “On the night of August 31, Zenab had come to the police station and claimed that her five-year-old son had been abducted by a woman. Based on her complaint, we registered a case of kidnapping,” added Singh. "

Lucknow,Rahul death mystery: SC seeks status report in week,"LUCKNOW: The Supreme Court has once again issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government, seeking within a week a status report in the murder case of La Martiniere student Rahul Sridhar. The notice was issued on August 30 based on a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the victim’s brother, Rohit Sridhar, in 2017. The apex court had issued a similar notice in April, which was not honoured by the state. The next date of hearing is in the third week of September. On April 10, 2015, 15-year-old Rahul, a Class IX student, fell to his death from the 100-feet-tall Constantia building on the college campus. His parents lodged a murder FIR against unidentified persons a week later. However, in its final report submitted in a trial court, police said Rahul’s death was a suicide. In February 2016, the bereaved family challenged the report in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) who ordered a reinvestigation, stating that the inquiry was not properly done. In August 2017, the family moved the high court and sought a CBI probe, claiming that evidence was being tampered with to show a murder as a suicide. While the HC directed police to conclude investigations within a month, it dismissed the demand for probe by an independent agency. Subsequently, Rahul’s brother filed the SLP in SC, which stated that the high court did not attempt to enquire about the “evasive investigation carried out by state police”. The petition once again harps on the need for an independent probe. “The HC disposed of the matter without even considering or appreciating doubts raised by the CJM in February 2016. Hence, we decided to move the SC,” Rohit said. The family’s counsel Alok Kumar, in the petition to SC, has stated that analyses of the postmortem report conducted by independent experts show that Rahul was murdered. He said police had not yet probed Rahul’s conversation on Facebook with a US citizen named Larry Conners. The latter, Kumar said, might have lured the student into violent web games. Key evidence like a blood-soaked bed linen, which was allegedly burnt by a school employee, was also not examined. Also, the signature of Rahul’s mother was forged on inquest reports. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Curious case of ‘missing’ car found in DIG house,"LUCKNOW: Mahanagar police was caught in a tricky situation on Tuesday when a ‘disputed’ vehicle was recovered from the official bungalow of a DIG near Wireless Crossing. According to SHO Ashok Kumar Singh, the car belongs to police sub-inspector Puja Yadav. She bought it in April 2018 and rented it to one Chandra Pal Singh who runs a travel agency. Puja knows Chandra Pal since 2016 when she was posted at Mahanagar police station and he was a witness in a case. However, on September 1, Puja’s husband Avinesh Dwivedi lodged an FIR against Chandra Pal for defaulting on car rent and not returning the vehicle. Avinesh also alleged that Chandra Pal had taken Rs 12 lakh as loan from them, but did not return the money. On Tuesday afternoon, Puja called Mahanagar police and said she saw her car parked at the bungalow of DIG (Technical) Anil Kumar. “We visited the DIG who gave us the key to the car. He said the sub-inspector and Chandra Pal came 15 days ago and parked the vehicle on his premises. We have returned the car to Puja,” the SHO said. DIG Kumar told TOI that Chandra Pal was a distant relative of his wife Pushpa. She said when Chandra Pal and Puja came to their house 15 days ago, the sub-inspector was drunk. So, Chandra Pal parked the vehicle and took Puja home. Chandra Pal conceded that he had not paid Puja the car rent since May, but claimed he returned the vehicle on August 18. “On August 20, I got a call from Puja and we met at Gol Market. She was in an inebriated state. I took permission from DIG’s wife, parked Puja’s vehicle at their bungalow and dropped her home in my vehicle,” he said, adding that he was being framed. Puja rubbished Chandra Pal’s claims. She said he had called her on August 24 and threatened her. He allegedly flaunted his links with “highly placed people”, and asked her to forget about the money and her car. "

Kanpur,Lucknowites give lessons in philanthropy,"Outside our homes, it’s the teachers that teach us the most important lessons in life. It’s the teachers who light that spark of inspiration in young lives that come to them to learn. And while for some teaching is a profession, there are some who take teaching as their calling and passion. On this Teacher’s Day we highlight some of these individuals, who are going out of their way to teach children in their free time, imparting lessons to the underprivileged for free getting paid for it with lots of love and respect. Sabiha Ahmad, Director Administrator at Lucknow Institute of Technology and a social activist, has been giving home tuitions to underprivileged children (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Sabiha Ahmad, Director Administrator at Lucknow Institute of Technology and a social activist, has been giving home tuitions to underprivileged children (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) One such person is Sabiha Ahmad, Director Administrator at Lucknow Institute of Technology and a social activist. Sabiha has been giving home tuitions to underprivileged children since she was a kid herself. “It’s not the fault of these kids if they’re born in poor families. They have full rights to get educated,” says Sabiha, who began with giving lessons in basic education to the children of her house helps and later on added more to her classes. Now her class has several dozen children, all from the neighbourhood, whose parents can't afford to send them to proper schools. “In order to inculcate an interest in them and make the classes more enjoyable, I start off with little games. This way they develop a better understanding of objects, colors, etc and it even helps in improving their English language. The biggest reward to me is when even if the parents of these children discourage them from studying, which happens quite often, these children still come to me saying 'Hum toh padhenge. Hamein padhna accha lagta hai. That makes me the happiest.” And just like Sabiha, is a student and social activist Sharad Patel, who has been educating the poverty-stricken for very many years and also providing shelter to quite a few. “The kids that I teach belong to the socially and economically weaker sections of the society and are deprived of the basic necessities, one of which includes education,” says Sharad. Bharti Agarwal, a homemaker is another one who devotes several hours each day to teach children (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Bharti Agarwal, a homemaker is another one who devotes several hours each day to teach children (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) “Since these children will be the future leaders of tomorrow, I can’t contribute to the education of these young lot,” adds Sharad, who has also opened his own center consisting of about 256 students. “I have been teaching kids who can’t afford education since 2016. The place where I teach these young minds is based in one corner of the city which is devoid of any education centre,” he adds. When asked about the motive behind all the work he is doing for these kids, Sharad says, “I want these children to be responsible citizens of our country. For that, I’ll have to make sure they study.” Adding further, Sharad who teaches beggars and kids in slums, says, “Each child has got some kind of talent, being able to figure that and bring it out is what I’m intending to do. Kids who couldn’t read or write are doing so well in dramatics. Then there are some kids who are coming up with phenomenal innovations in science, some which are so thorough with the constitution that they keep discussing current affairs of the nation. Overall we want to enhance their areas of expertise and want them to become great leaders.” Bharti Agarwal, a homemaker is another one who devotes several hours each day to teach children who can’t afford to go to a regular school. Bharti started teaching the economically deprived five years back in a temple and recalling her journey, she says, “Outside my house I’d notice children lurking around, collecting kites, picking plastics from the bin, which made me realize that the future of tomorrow can’t look like this. When I managed to get connected with these kids, I realized how talented they are and that they just needed a platform. These kids didn’t know how the world functions or didn’t have any purpose in life. Some kids were super energetic, some kids were blessed with great drawing and sketching skills, a few had great grasping power. Jua khel ke, kancha khel ke, aise saare games khel key yeh paise kamana jaante thay. I realised that most of the kids went to school but they couldn’t read simple Hindi. Then I decided that I needed to do something about it and I started taking classes and noticing the potential of these kids.” Dr Shipra Dhar Srivastava, a known gynaecologist from Varanasi, holds teaching sessions for children (BCCL) Dr Shipra Dhar Srivastava, a known gynaecologist from Varanasi, holds teaching sessions for children (BCCL) Now five years later, Bharti proudly tells us how some of her taught have actually fared well in academics in different schools. “I feel so happy to be teaching such brilliant kids. They’ve started enjoying studying.” And ask her why she teaches for free, and Bharti simply flashes a smile and says, “I’m probably in that phase of life where I now want to give back to society. Aur jab yeh bacche bade hoke kuchh ban jayengey, mere dil ko bahot khushi milegi.” And it’s not just Lucknow, in places like Varanasi, Prayagraj and Kanpur also we find such people who are taking precious time out to teach children and helping them move ahead in life. Moni Agarwal, who is running a school in the suburbs of Varanasi for the children of the economically weaker strata of the society, gave up a successful coaching centre to start this social venture. “I use to accompany my husband, who has a business on the outskirts of Varanasi. During my visits, I saw that there was no proper school for the children belonging to daily wagers and farmers, the main communities living in that area. So I decided to start this school. Apart from the regular curriculum, we also teach them social skills and also hygiene. I teach science, mathematics and also chip in for other subjects when required,” she says. The biggest challenge says Moni is to prevent dropouts. “Despite emphasising on the importance of education to children and their parents, continuing with their studies is something which is not a priority for them. Still, I try convincing them on a daily basis. I feel really contented when I am successful in doing so,” she says. Another such person is Dr Shipra Dhar Srivastava, a known gynaecologist from Varanasi, who holds teaching sessions for children -- mainly girls from her neighbourhood. “These are girls who live in the slum area in the vicinity of my hospital. The idea to teach these youngsters came when one of my household staff fell ill and she had sent her young daughter instead. My son who happened to be at home at that time pointed out that this girl should be in school rather than doing household chores. So I decided to do something for girls kids like her. There are nearly 20 girls who come for daily classes. We teach them right from the alphabets to personal hygiene. Some of these children initially were not able to even decipher the alphabets but now they have really picked up well and are doing well in their studies. My special focus is on girls because they are often denied basic needs. It is very satisfying if one is able to make a difference in someone’s life,” says Dr Shipra. It is the feeling of contributing his bit to the nation-building that Abhishek Jain, a fourth-year student of Engineering Physics at IIT - BHU, is working as a volunteer in the teaching of the underprivileged, an initiative started by a faculty of IIT BHU and his wife, some years ago. Harshita Kesarwani, an entrepreneur by profession holds teaching classes for the economically poor children (BCCL) Harshita Kesarwani, an entrepreneur by profession holds teaching classes for the economically poor children (BCCL) “A lot of students from our institution are part of this project. In fact, we also have a WhatsApp group of this where the teaching time table is displayed and we take up the teaching slots accordingly. The classes are held in the evening at the residence of our faculty member. I try being part of these classes at least once a week. Children of various age groups from neighbouring slum areas come to study where we give them both academic assistance as well as general information. Our stress is more on the girls since they at times not the priorities of their families when it comes to education. We try to teach them to stand up for themselves. Even for us, it is a learning experience since we get to know the real situation of the underprivileged people of the society. Helping them really gives a good feeling of doing something for the society,” he says. An entrepreneur by profession, Harshita Kesarwani, from Prayagraj also has an philanthropist aspect to her personality. Holding teaching classes for the economically weaker children living in her vicinity is what gives her immense pleasure. “Earlier I used to hold daily classes but now they have been confined to holidays. Most of these kids have started going to a regular school, so they are free only on a holiday,” she says. Moni Agarwal, who is running a school in the suburbs of Varanasi (BCCL) Moni Agarwal, who is running a school in the suburbs of Varanasi (BCCL) “It all began last year, as I used to see children -- mainly girls -- playing on the street near my residence. Since they didn’t have any place to play so I allowed them to come to our courtyard. What was really jarring to the ears was the foul language used by these kids. So I thought of teaching them how to make proper use of language. I also started taking English classes for them in which I taught them how to speak in English and also write essays in English. Gradually some of them started reading English newspapers. I began with just five kids and their number has now increased to 44. Apart from English, I also taught them social etiquette that has really changed their personality. Personally, for me it was also a learning experience as it gave me more acceptance of people belonging to the lower strata of society,” she says. In Kanpur too, people are doing their bot. Retired professor Dr Abhay Dwivedi is one such teacher from Kanpur who believes in imparting knowledge to the students without charging a dime from them. “Teaching has always been a passion for me. I used to be a professor in the art and painting department at DAV Degree College. After retiring from the college I thought of training children in the art of painting for free. Presently, there are around15 students who come to me for painting classes. The experience of teaching for me is divine and satisfying. Kaha jaata hai ki vidya ko jitna bantiye utna hi badhti hai….aur main wohi kar raha hoon. The free time that I have is best for educating more and more students for free. Keeping the same thing in mind I also came up with a Gurukul art gallery in Kanpur where these students can display their art work for free,” informs, Dr Dwivedi. Charu Manglick is another Kanpurite who is educating underprivileged children in a slum area in the town.

My children were out of town for higher studies and I used to have ample free time. So I decided to go to the slum area in order to identify small children and start a school so that they at least learn to read and write.

Lucknow,Lucknowites give lessons in philanthropy,"Outside our homes, it’s the teachers that teach us the most important lessons in life. It’s the teachers who light that spark of inspiration in young lives that come to them to learn. And while for some teaching is a profession, there are some who take teaching as their calling and passion. On this Teacher’s Day we highlight some of these individuals, who are going out of their way to teach children in their free time, imparting lessons to the underprivileged for free getting paid for it with lots of love and respect. Sabiha Ahmad, Director Administrator at Lucknow Institute of Technology and a social activist, has been giving home tuitions to underprivileged children (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Sabiha Ahmad, Director Administrator at Lucknow Institute of Technology and a social activist, has been giving home tuitions to underprivileged children (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) One such person is Sabiha Ahmad, Director Administrator at Lucknow Institute of Technology and a social activist. Sabiha has been giving home tuitions to underprivileged children since she was a kid herself. “It’s not the fault of these kids if they’re born in poor families. They have full rights to get educated,” says Sabiha, who began with giving lessons in basic education to the children of her house helps and later on added more to her classes. Now her class has several dozen children, all from the neighbourhood, whose parents can't afford to send them to proper schools. “In order to inculcate an interest in them and make the classes more enjoyable, I start off with little games. This way they develop a better understanding of objects, colors, etc and it even helps in improving their English language. The biggest reward to me is when even if the parents of these children discourage them from studying, which happens quite often, these children still come to me saying 'Hum toh padhenge. Hamein padhna accha lagta hai. That makes me the happiest.” And just like Sabiha, is a student and social activist Sharad Patel, who has been educating the poverty-stricken for very many years and also providing shelter to quite a few. “The kids that I teach belong to the socially and economically weaker sections of the society and are deprived of the basic necessities, one of which includes education,” says Sharad. Bharti Agarwal, a homemaker is another one who devotes several hours each day to teach children (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Bharti Agarwal, a homemaker is another one who devotes several hours each day to teach children (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) “Since these children will be the future leaders of tomorrow, I can’t contribute to the education of these young lot,” adds Sharad, who has also opened his own center consisting of about 256 students. “I have been teaching kids who can’t afford education since 2016. The place where I teach these young minds is based in one corner of the city which is devoid of any education centre,” he adds. When asked about the motive behind all the work he is doing for these kids, Sharad says, “I want these children to be responsible citizens of our country. For that, I’ll have to make sure they study.” Adding further, Sharad who teaches beggars and kids in slums, says, “Each child has got some kind of talent, being able to figure that and bring it out is what I’m intending to do. Kids who couldn’t read or write are doing so well in dramatics. Then there are some kids who are coming up with phenomenal innovations in science, some which are so thorough with the constitution that they keep discussing current affairs of the nation. Overall we want to enhance their areas of expertise and want them to become great leaders.” Bharti Agarwal, a homemaker is another one who devotes several hours each day to teach children who can’t afford to go to a regular school. Bharti started teaching the economically deprived five years back in a temple and recalling her journey, she says, “Outside my house I’d notice children lurking around, collecting kites, picking plastics from the bin, which made me realize that the future of tomorrow can’t look like this. When I managed to get connected with these kids, I realized how talented they are and that they just needed a platform. These kids didn’t know how the world functions or didn’t have any purpose in life. Some kids were super energetic, some kids were blessed with great drawing and sketching skills, a few had great grasping power. Jua khel ke, kancha khel ke, aise saare games khel key yeh paise kamana jaante thay. I realised that most of the kids went to school but they couldn’t read simple Hindi. Then I decided that I needed to do something about it and I started taking classes and noticing the potential of these kids.” Dr Shipra Dhar Srivastava, a known gynaecologist from Varanasi, holds teaching sessions for children (BCCL) Dr Shipra Dhar Srivastava, a known gynaecologist from Varanasi, holds teaching sessions for children (BCCL) Now five years later, Bharti proudly tells us how some of her taught have actually fared well in academics in different schools. “I feel so happy to be teaching such brilliant kids. They’ve started enjoying studying.” And ask her why she teaches for free, and Bharti simply flashes a smile and says, “I’m probably in that phase of life where I now want to give back to society. Aur jab yeh bacche bade hoke kuchh ban jayengey, mere dil ko bahot khushi milegi.” And it’s not just Lucknow, in places like Varanasi, Prayagraj and Kanpur also we find such people who are taking precious time out to teach children and helping them move ahead in life. Moni Agarwal, who is running a school in the suburbs of Varanasi for the children of the economically weaker strata of the society, gave up a successful coaching centre to start this social venture. “I use to accompany my husband, who has a business on the outskirts of Varanasi. During my visits, I saw that there was no proper school for the children belonging to daily wagers and farmers, the main communities living in that area. So I decided to start this school. Apart from the regular curriculum, we also teach them social skills and also hygiene. I teach science, mathematics and also chip in for other subjects when required,” she says. The biggest challenge says Moni is to prevent dropouts. “Despite emphasising on the importance of education to children and their parents, continuing with their studies is something which is not a priority for them. Still, I try convincing them on a daily basis. I feel really contented when I am successful in doing so,” she says. Another such person is Dr Shipra Dhar Srivastava, a known gynaecologist from Varanasi, who holds teaching sessions for children -- mainly girls from her neighbourhood. “These are girls who live in the slum area in the vicinity of my hospital. The idea to teach these youngsters came when one of my household staff fell ill and she had sent her young daughter instead. My son who happened to be at home at that time pointed out that this girl should be in school rather than doing household chores. So I decided to do something for girls kids like her. There are nearly 20 girls who come for daily classes. We teach them right from the alphabets to personal hygiene. Some of these children initially were not able to even decipher the alphabets but now they have really picked up well and are doing well in their studies. My special focus is on girls because they are often denied basic needs. It is very satisfying if one is able to make a difference in someone’s life,” says Dr Shipra. It is the feeling of contributing his bit to the nation-building that Abhishek Jain, a fourth-year student of Engineering Physics at IIT - BHU, is working as a volunteer in the teaching of the underprivileged, an initiative started by a faculty of IIT BHU and his wife, some years ago.

In fact, we also have a WhatsApp group of this where the teaching time table is displayed and we take up the teaching slots accordingly. The classes are held in the evening at the residence of our faculty member. I try being part of these classes at least once a week. Children of various age groups from neighbouring slum areas come to study where we give them both academic assistance as well as general information. Our stress is more on the girls since they at times not the priorities of their families when it comes to education. We try to teach them to stand up for themselves. Even for us, it is a learning experience since we get to know the real situation of the underprivileged people of the society. Helping them really gives a good feeling of doing something for the society,” he says. An entrepreneur by profession, Harshita Kesarwani, from Prayagraj also has an philanthropist aspect to her personality. Holding teaching classes for the economically weaker children living in her vicinity is what gives her immense pleasure. “Earlier I used to hold daily classes but now they have been confined to holidays.

Since they didn’t have any place to play so I allowed them to come to our courtyard. What was really jarring to the ears was the foul language used by these kids. So I thought of teaching them how to make proper use of language. I also started taking English classes for them in which I taught them how to speak in English and also write essays in English. Gradually some of them started reading English newspapers. I began with just five kids and their number has now increased to 44. Apart from English, I also taught them social etiquette that has really changed their personality. Personally, for me it was also a learning experience as it gave me more acceptance of people belonging to the lower strata of society,” she says. In Kanpur too, people are doing their bot. Retired professor Dr Abhay Dwivedi is one such teacher from Kanpur who believes in imparting knowledge to the students without charging a dime from them. “Teaching has always been a passion for me. I used to be a professor in the art and painting department at DAV Degree College. After retiring from the college I thought of training children in the art of painting for free. Presently, there are around15 students who come to me for painting classes. The experience of teaching for me is divine and satisfying.

So I decided to go to the slum area in order to identify small children and start a school so that they at least learn to read and write. The residents of the slum area were impressed with my idea and provided me a 5x5 small room for starting the school. Since the time I have started the school there is always a strength of 12-15 students every day. The idea of running this small school is to provide basic education to these underprivileged children and also to motivate them to continue their studies,” informs, Charu Manglick. — With inputs from Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,UP: Tattoo-wali teacher who brought kids back to school,"LUCKNOW: Much before the clock strikes eight in the morning, her class is crowded with eager students. Tattoos on her body and puppets in hands, she walks in with a sprint in her step, sparking an excitement you rarely see in conventional classrooms. Meet Shipra Tiwari, a primary teacher, who has deservedly earned the sobriquet ‘Tattoo-wali Madam-ji’ given that her funky style and wacky tools of teaching have improved attendance at this government school in Sonwa, Bakshi ka Talab. “I don’t miss her class for a single day,” beamed Suhani Sharma, a student. “Like big schools, we too have a class monitor, a best performer award and an all-rounder selfie corner,” Suhani added. Suchit, another student, said he liked the bottle garden session. “We collect old bottles and turn them into fancy planters. Best out of waste is our motto. We have not only decorated our whole school, but also our homes,” he said. There was a time when this Sonwa school had thin attendance. The few who came to class eagerly waited for the lunch bell to ring. All that has changed. “I didn’t want my students to study without interest or come to school just for midday meal. I decided to make learning fun for them so that they attended their classes by choice,” Shipra told TOI. Among her first teaching tools were puppets. She used them to teach hygiene like washing hands before meals. She also uses modern tools like Android apps. “My students went up to their friends and told them about gudda-guddi (puppet) show. The next day the classroom was chock-a-block,” Shipra said. Read this story in Bengali"
Lucknow,Lucknow: Cops to review autopsy report before reply in Supreme Court,"LUCKNOW: The Lucknow police will get the post-mortem examination report of La Martiniere student Rahul Sridhar re-examined by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) before submitting status report to the Supreme Court. The apex court had on August 30 issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government seeking a status report within a week. Officials said they would send a rejoinder to social networking company Facebook to seek information about US citizen Larry Conners, who befriended Rahul posing as a CIA agent and allegedly instigated him to commit suicide by luring him into violent web games. On April 10, 2015, 15-year-old Rahul, a Class IX student, fell to his death from the Constantia building on the college campus. His parents lodged a murder FIR against unidentified persons a week later. However, in its final report submitted in a trial court, the police had said that Rahul’s death was a suicide. The victim’s mother, Annamma, questioned the inconsistent pattern of injuries on the body of her son and suspected torture after Rahul’s fall from Constantia building. The parents also got the post-mortem report examined by independent experts from India and United Kingdom, and both hinted at homicide. Experts pointed out that injuries on the body appeared to be caused by assault with a blunt object and not from fall. They said in case of a fall from a height, spinal or limb fractures were common but it was not found in Rahul’s case. They pointed out that two injuries on his leg were difficult to explain and could have been there before the fall. Annamma had also alleged that inquest details were tampered with and witness signatures on the report forged. The procedure of performing inquest in the presence of a magistrate was also not followed. She alleged the bed linen in which Rahul’s body was brought to Civil Hospital’s mortuary was later burnt while his school uniform went missing. Police could only recover the student’s phone 24 hours later and tampered with it too,” she added. Circle officer, Hazratganj, Abhay Mishra said all the allegations made by the family were being examined. “We will get the post-mortem report of Rahul Sridhar re-examined by CFSL,” he said, adding that the case diary was also being read and shortcomings would be brought to the notice of senior officers.

Kanpur,Lucknow Municipal Corporation score low in smart city project execution,"LUCKNOW: After performing poorly in Swachh Bharat ranking, the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) faced another embarrassment, when it was ranked 45th among 100 cities across the country in the execution of smart city projects. This was revealed in an evaluation report recently released by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MOHUA). Even in the state, the city stood third after Kanpur (all-India 3rd rank) and Varanasi (all-India 11th rank) out of eight cities evaluated by the ministry. Lucknow was among 100 cities in the country and eight in the state selected under the smart city mission of the central government in 2015. The ranking was based on the progress of projects initiated through funds received under the smart city schemes. In swachhta campaign, the city scored 122 rank in 402 cities. Total 57 projects were launched here under smart city. These included development of Kaiserbagh area as a heritage zone, smart bus shelter, smart roads, integrated traffic management system, single window grievance redressal system for civic complaints, smart parking, solar-powered electricity supply to government buildings and Metro, among others. Of these, only Metro and single window grievance redressal system have been started. Though the deadline of many projects is between 2024-30, MOHUA evaluates progress of projects annually to ensure that the work is carried out with efficiently. Accordingly, every project has to achieve the targeted growth set annually for them. Although the single window grievance redressal cell has been established, it is only accepting complaints related to LMC as of now. According to officials, projects like smart bus shelters, command and control centre and installing of solar panels in five government buildings have been completed. While some other major projects like area-based development (ABD) of Kaiserbagh area, installing variable messaging boards, smart parking and construction of smart roads among others are still in progress. Explaining the poor ranking, the civic body claims that the delay in releasing the funds is one of the main reasons for the slow progress of smart city projects. However, some officials also blamed private agencies for the slow construction pace. "

Lucknow,Mahanagar and Alambagh water not safe for drinking,"LUCKNOW: Over 100,000 residents in seven city neighbourhoods are at an increased risk of suffering from diseases, thanks to contaminated water supply. A joint survey by Jal Sansthan and the district health department collected 60 samples from Mahanagar, Chinhat, Badshahnagar, Khadra, Alambagh, Nishadganj and LDA Colony between August 29 and September 4. Nine of these samples do not meet the chlorination standard. Some of the samples also had sand particles. According to Jal Sansthan guidelines, every litre of water should have 0.2-0.4 microgram of chlorine to make it potable. A concentration less than that does not kill bacteria and other microbes, making the water unsuitable for consumption. “Lack of chlorine indicates that either the disinfectant wasn’t added to the water before it was released from Jal Sansthan’s pumping stations or there were leaks in the pipelines,” said a senior health department official. “Contaminated water with harmful microrganisms may lead to indigestion, diarrhoea, typhoid and fungal infections. A letter has been sent to Jal Sansthan to maintain the desired amount of chlorine,” said additional chief medical officer DK Bajpai. Jal Sansthan executive engineer OP Singh said pumping stations had been given necessary instructions. “We also plan to launch a drive to spot leaks and plug them,” he added. Residents said they were receiving contaminated supply since mid-July. “Many people in my area are suffering from diarrhoea,” said Ajay Singh of Khadra. Susmita Singh of Alambagh said she boiled and then filtered water before giving it to her seven-year-old. “Complaints to the local corporator has fallen on deaf ears,” she added. The recent survey is part of an ongoing monsoon campaign to check the quality of drinking water supply. Two surveys in August that covered areas like Lalbagh, Aliganj (Mohibullahpur), Jankipuram, Para, Gomtinagar and Indiranagar, among others, had found similar irregularities. "

Lucknow,Congress leader’s 25-year-old son shot dead in Amethi district,"LUCKNOW: A 25-year-old MNC executive and son of a Congress leader was killed in Kotwali police station area of Amethi district on Wednesday. Police suspect the attack to be a fallout of an old rivalry between the accused and the victim’s father. Neeraj Pandey was out on a morning walk when he was accosted by bike-borne assailants barely 500m from his residence and shot six times. His father Ram Asrey Pandey, who was right behind him on a bicycle, rushed him to the district hospital. From there, Neeraj was referred to Lucknow’s KGMU Trauma Centre where doctors declared him brought dead. Ram Asrey Pandey was the president of Congress’ district block committee in Gauriganj from 1984 to 2009. He told TOI, “I was just 100m behind my son, on my way to purchase grocery when I saw him being shot in front of my eyes. He sustained bullet injuries on his face, head, stomach and chest.” “I saw Babban Mishra, Pankaj Mishra and Jitendra along with eight other unidentified aides on five bikes shoot my son. I clearly saw them brandishing guns and firing,” Pandey told TOI from Lucknow. “I informed the police and took my son to the district hospital from where he was referred to KGMU Trauma Centre but doctors there declared him brought dead,” he added. Amethi SP Khyati Garg told TOI that police have not yet received a formal complaint Pandey is still in Lucknow. “Pandey said he will file a complaint upon returning,” the SP said. Prima facie, it has come to the fore that Pandey had an old rivalry with the accused. “In 2016, Ram Asrey Pandey was named in an attack on the father of one of the accused,” SP Garg said. Neeraj’s family said he worked with an MNC in Haryana and had returned home citing health issues. "
Lucknow,UP may take a month to implement Motor Vehicles Act,"LUCKNOW: The state government may take at least another month to comply with the amended Motor Vehicles (MV) Act which provides for higher penalties for traffic offences. In June, the state government had increased the compoundable penalty for certain violations but the new penalties announced on September 1 would only be imposed after the cabinet nod. When TOI contacted principal secretary (transport) Arvind Kumar to ask about the reason for delay in imposition of new penalties, he said a notification would be issued by the government after cabinet approval. The entire exercise may take at least a month. The principal secretary said the amended MV Act with higher fines and penalties would continue to remain the same in cases which go to court. “When a violator is issued a challan, he gets two options. He may pay the penalty on the spot or the challan goes to court. Currently, if a person has been slapped a fine and he chooses to pay it on the spot, he will not be charged higher penalty announced recently. However, if the challan reaches the court, he will have to pay fine according to the amended MV Act,” he said. "

Lucknow,The SC verdict on Section 377 gave me the confidence to come out in the open: Dutee Chand,"The first Indian woman track and field athlete to clinch a gold medal in the World Universiade in July and also the first Indian athlete to come out in the open and talk about her same-sex relationship, sprinter Dutee Chand was in Lucknow for the 59th National Inter-State Senior Athletics Championship 2019. Unfazed by the media attention she is getting after disclosing her relationship in May this year, the Odisha athlete in a candid conversation talks about how she has been preparing for the World Championship to be held in Doha next month, about her reconciliation with her family and also about how society is treating her now. The national record holder of 100m sprint, Dutee made headlines in May with her bold disclosure of making public her relationship with a woman in her village in Odisha. Although Dutee is still waiting for her family to accept the news and Dutee’s choices in life, Dutee says, ""Family ka mann nahi badla hai par future mein zarur badal jayega, koi gham ki baat nahi hai."" Succumbing to the pressure from her elder sister, who had threatened to tell their parents about Dutee’s relationship unless she accepted it publicly, Dutee finally took a call of coming out in the open about it. Ask her how the reconciliation with her family is going on and she is quick to respond, ""I focus more on my training than my family matters. Family se meri abhi itni baat-chit nahi ho rahi hai kyunki mera har mahine alag-alag competition rehta hai. Abhi jo mera kaam hai, training par dhyan dena and competition ke liye mehnat karna hai, woh main kar rahi hoon. I have no pressure on me now."" Dutee Chand (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Dutee Chand (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Ask the Jajpur-born athlete about how other people in the society are treating her now and she says with a sigh, ""Initially for 10-15 days it was a very bad situation for me. Par ab koi mujhe bura nahi bol raha hai, sab support kar rahe hain."" So how difficult was it to come out in the open and talk about a taboo thing in our society? ""Mere mann mein bahut darr chal raha tha ki main ek sportsperson hoon aur sab log kya nazar se dekhenge! Mujhe khelne denge ya nahi? But ek confidence bhi tha kyunki Supreme Court ne Section 377 hata diya tha aur mujhe malum tha ki ab yeh koi crime nahi hai."" It must have been really hard for her talk about her personal life in India, so does she think there are many other in the sports field who are in similar relationships but are afraid to make things public? ""Not only sports but also in other fields like education, acting and so many other fields, there are people who are living their relationships secretively and are unable to come out in the open. Because hamare India mein friends ke naam par chahe hotel mein ruko, room mein ruko ya hostel mein ruko, koi objection nahi hai but jaise hi aap sex ke baare mein bol denge duniya aapko doosri nazar se dekhti hai. Mujhe lagta hai har sector mein 40 percent aise log honge jo apni relationships chhupa kar rakhte hain. But main ek celebrity hoon bata diya toh log ab ise follow kar rahe hain."" Although she doesn’t feel every such relationship should come out in the open, ""Mujhe dikkat thi meri didi se toh maine bol diya. There is no need to talk about your relationship in public if you don’t want to. If you love each other that’s more than enough,"" she says. Coming to the professional front, quiz her about the facilities being provided to athletes and she replies in a dismal tone, ""Lots of facilities are being provided by the government and private sector too but I think deserving athletes are not being able to get all the benefits of the schemes. Like my name is not in the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), though I have asked several times to the concerned authorities but I have got no support from them. But my Odisha government is supporting me and provides me everything I need for my training."" Talking about Uttar Pradesh and the facilities here, she says, ""The facilities are very good in Uttar Pradesh. It has 4-5 synthetic tracks which in itself speaks volumes about the infrastructure. I came here in 2012 to participate in a national sports event and I was given a car by the then government for being the champion of that event. So, I think the governments in UP have been promoting sports in the state very well."" Sharing her feeling about becoming the first Indian to win the 100m gold in a global event at World Universiade last month, Dutee says, ""This gold medal was special as it is my first in senior athletics. Though I started playing in 2006 and have played in various competitions and even won a gold in the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in 2014. Since then it has been a dry run. But now I feel proud to have won this gold medal."" The 23-year-old Dutee clocked 11.32 seconds in her last event but she is yet to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. ""In Rio Olympics, the qualifying timing was kept at 11.30 seconds and I qualified by clocking 11.24 seconds but in the upcoming Olympics the qualifying time given for India is 11.15 which is a daunting task. Even my personal best has not reached that mark ever but still, my preparations are on in full swing. I still have 6-7 months at my disposal and I will try my level best to qualify for the big event under the guidance of my coach N Ramesh,"" she shares. "

Lucknow,"Mahanagar road caves in, PWD blames pipeline leak","LUCKNOW: A portion of the busy Mandir Marg near Kapoorthala Crossing in Mahanagar caved in and formed a fourfeet-deep pit on Thursday evening, leaving the arterial stretch out of bounds for traffic. TimesViewThe frequency with which roads are caving in indicates how lack of coordination between civic agencies can prove fatal for citizens. The drilling done on roads by LMC, Lesa and Jal Santhan for laying pipelines, without permission from PWD, is causing fissures on roads. The government should hold officials responsible for such lapses and book them under charges of criminal negligence.This is the second such incident in the city in three days and fourth in three months. On September 4, a thoroughfare in Sector 14 of Indiranagar had to be closed to traffic after a portion of the road caved in, trapping a bulldozer. According to officials of Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department (UPPWD), the road that caved in on Thursday was weakened following damage to an underground water pipeline. State PWD officials said government departments and agencies like telecom, LESA, Jal Sansthan and LMC used “horizontal directional drilling technique” to lay pipelines, which did not require digging up of the whole road. “But, most of these departments/agencies do not seek information on underground cables and pipelines before undertaking drilling work. And that often leads to damage. Unbridled water pressure can weaken roads. Cave-in cases have increased and we will serve legal notices to departments concerned,” a UPPWD official said. Commuters in Mahanagar extension who witnessed the cave-in called for long-term measures to bolster roads to stem chances of accidents and injuries. “My brother and I were riding a bike. Suddenly, we heard people shouting. We looked back to see the road behind us had sunk in. We got lucky,” said Naman Sinha. Sarvesh Gupta, another commuter, added: “It was a good thing that no one was hurt. Imagine if someone fell into that yawning gap! The injuries could have been critical.” Shrutika Saxena, also a daily commuter in the area, said roads in the city didn’t last for even two months. “They either develop potholes or cave in after a few bouts of rainfall. About time the authorities found a permanent solution to these chronic problems,” she said. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad gyms need doctor’s nod to prescribe supplements,"GHAZIABAD: Without a doctor’s prescription, trainers at your neighbourhood gym will no longer be able to give you any health supplement for increasing or decreasing weight. Worried that prolonged consumption of supplements can cause high BP, hormonal imbalances and other side-effects, and even lead to kidney and liver problems at a later stage, the district magistrate (DM) has directed the chief medical officer (CMO) to issue instructions to gym owners after a survey and make it mandatory for them to display an advisory on the do’s and don’ts and exercise. They will also be required to display a general diet plan approved by a physician and dietician. DM Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “Hundreds of gyms are operating across the district where thousands of people are going every day to remain fit. Several types of health supplements are sold in the name of gaining or losing weight and remaining fit without even looking into their side-effects. Such supplements are not only found to be resulting in physical damages, but also causing mental disorders.” The CMO has been given the responsibility to conduct periodical inspection of gyms and initiate action against violators. The DM has also constituted a committee, comprising an additional city magistrate, a government doctor, food safety officer and district sports officer, to regulate the functioning of gyms. Dr RP Singh, physician, MMG District Hospital, said, “The main content of health supplements is whey protein which is extracted from the milk products and contains a high amount of lactose. The harmful effects start with the abdomen. There are chances of developing gastritis and vomiting tendency if the product is taken for a longer duration. Bloating and lactose intolerance are other side-effects.” Liver and kidney problems can start later, he added. High intake of protein for a long period leads to high creatinine level in body resulting in kidney damage. It also weakens the bones in the longer run. Prasoon Chadda, who owns a gym in Patel Nagar, said, “The measures should have been followed by gym owners in the first place. Most do not have made proper arrangement for physicians and dieticians. Every person has a different diet requirement and only nutritionists and doctors can understand that. Health supplements are not required for people who are exercising to remain fit. Instead, the focus should be on a balanced diet.” "

""We were discussing Section 377 and it was a pleasant surprise when participants said that even while they personally did not believe in the rights of LGBTQI, the SC taking a stand had made it acceptable for them too,"" said Megha, a 24-year-old activist.

Kanpur,"Visit Sindhu river in Leh, get Rs 20,000: UP to Sindhis","LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath government has decided to give a Rs 20,000-dole to Sindhis to undertake a pilgrimage to Indus river, which the community considers sacred, in Leh, saying the situation in Jammu and Kashmir post-reorganisation has changed and become more conducive to tourism. The state government's religious affairs department (dharmarth karya) on Wednesday issued a direction to district magistrates, asking them to convey the message to the Sindhi Academy and its representatives and claim Rs 20,000 after completion of trip to Leh. Though the yatra is usually undertaken during Guru Purnima amid celebration of Sindhu Darshan festival in June, the UP government's direction to all DMs stated such trips be taken by the community throughout the year, who can claim the money after the trip. ""This pilgrimage is largely represented by the Sindhi community in UP who visit Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh regions. This pilgrimage needs to be promoted as the situation in J&amp;K and Ladakh has changed now. This will help generate employment for locals in that region and Sindhu darshan will be able to play a bigger role than just tourism,"" the government note said. UP religious affairs minister Neelkanth Tiwari said this move can be seen as a boost to Centre's efforts to unify India. ""We must do our bit to support the Centre and Union home minister Amit Shah in this historic decision. There is a new lease of life in Jammu and Kashmir region after annulment of Article 370. CM Yogi Adityanath has initiated this new dole and the religious affairs department, headed by me, has been asked to communicate to all district magistrates to convey the decision to the community. The decision will help generate tourism and jobs for locals in Leh and fulfill wishes of Sindhis, who consider the river sacred. It will help both UP and J&amp;K,"" Tiwari told TOI. The Yogi government in March hiked the pilgrimage dole from Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000 for every Sindhi community member. Currently, UP has more than 50 lakh Sindhis spread between Varanasi, Kanpur, Unnao, Lucknow and Allahabad. ""We are happy this initiative can cover the airfare and hotel stay. As usually, less than a hundred would undertake pilgrimage at government expense. This grant will cover the fare of many of our community and integrate J&amp;K with rest of the country. Our other concern is the forced conversion of Sindhi girls in Pakistan. And we have sought a meeting with Lucknow MP and defence minister Rajnath Singh to address this concern,"" said Ashok Motiani, president Sindhi Samaj, Lucknow. The dole would be on the pattern of Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage grant, which was raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh for every pilgrim this year. ""The state will give the grant to every Sindhi pilgrim. Whether he uses it for reimbursement of air fare, hotel or train or bus journey. Each pilgrim can apply and seek the grant with due submission and verification of journey documents,"" said Tiwari. Government officials said then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy PM Lal Krishna Advani, himself a Sindhi, had launched the Sindhu Darshan Abhiyan, with a handful of Sindhi devotees, to visit Leh in 1996.

Lucknow,"UP: After tariff hike, Gandhigiri to recover dues","LUCKNOW: After effecting a 12% hike in power tariff, the UP energy department has decided to adopt 'Gandhian' ways for recovering pending arrears from consumers. Instead of disconnecting electricity connections, the power department would launch a 'knock-the-door' campaign, wherein staff would visit defaulters and politely ask them to pay their dues on time. UP energy minister, Shrikant Sharma, told TOI, ""Instead of taking harsh steps, the department would reach out to consumers in various ways and ask them to pay their dues. It would be a Gandhian way of recovering dues."" As per the plan, officials would knock the doors of consumers having outstanding dues, make phone calls and also send SMSes, apprising them about pending bills and ask them to pay it on time. The move comes more than a fortnight after UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) launched a statewide drive against defaulters and disconnected connections of those having substantial dues. The rural areas would especially be on the radar of the department. As per records, around 70% of the dues are in rural areas. President of UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhogta Parishad, Avdhesh Kumar Verma, said, ""There would not have been any hike in power tariff if successive governments had been recovering dues on time. The state departments alone account for Rs 11,000 crore power dues. The government needs to do its bit to get these cleared."" Sources said ruling BJP was not inclined to take strong measures against erring consumers for now. "

The governor also made a veiled suggestion to the Yogi government to follow the Gujarat model of governance by expediting projects and meeting deadlines to save time and cost overruns. While the Yogi government is gearing up to celebrate two-and-half years in power on September 17, the governor creating a record of sorts in Raj Bhawan by calling the chief minister, his two deputies and the entire council of ministers to present their report card. The session lasted for over two hours.

She also said land disputes of farmers should be swiftly addressed so that they can till their farms and get easy loans.

He said his government had introduced fundamental policy changes, which resulted in drawing investments of Rs 4.28 lakh crore in the state. He also highlighted e-tendering for all major projects. Power supply was adequate and there were no protests during summer on outages. Also, strict action against criminals has improved law and order, the CM said. Since the political complexion of the state and the Centre is same and the governor herself had been a BJP chief minister, there was no confrontation over the summons from Raj Bhawan. Political experts said, if the regimes at the Centre and state had variant ideologies, it would have sparked friction as was witnessed in the past. The proactive governor has already unnerved the state government by inspecting police stations, holding review meetings and issuing directions to the Yogi government from time to time. "

Lucknow,"Mayawati gears up for UP bypolls, woos Muslims, Dalits and OBCs","LUCKNOW: BSP chief Mayawati is once again banking on social engineering to galvanize the party and increasing its support base in the state ahead of the 2022 UP assembly elections. Seeing an opportunity to recapture the political space in UP after Congress and Samajwadi Party fared poorly in general elections, Mayawati on Thursday appointed three state co-ordinators, including a Muslim, a Dalit and an OBC. She appointed the party’s first Muslim state chief Munqad Ali, Dalit MLC B R Ambedkar and R S Kushwaha, a prominent OBC leader in the party, as state co-ordinators to oversee party’s growth in Uttar Pradesh. The three leaders have been directed to tour each part of the state and report directly to Mayawati. “We will focus on bringing non-Yadav and non-Lodh OBC voters back to the party. We realize that a chunk of OBCs and Dalits has moved away, even though we contested Lok Sabha polls in alliance with SP. There will be concerted efforts to bring them back,” said a senior party leader. Mayawati is also focusing on minorities and tried to woo the community by appointing Ali as party state unit’s first Muslim president. Now, she has enhanced his stature by making him one of the three co-ordinators. Though party insiders accept BSP is not the first choice of Muslims, they said it is crucial to reach out to them and woo them away from Congress and SP. “On Thursday, Behenji decentralised the state unit. People who had charge of three divisions will now look after one. Similarly, responsibilities of several office-bearers have been reduced and given to more people,” said a party member. The party also plans to highlight the failures of Centre and state governments like state of economy, rising unemployment, law and order, in coming byelections. “BSP is contesting bypolls for the first time after 2007, so we are taking it like a full election. The poor law and order is BJP’s failure since it is in power both in the state and at Centre,” said a party worker. "

Lucknow,"UP man stumbles upon Rs 27 lakh gold, silver jewellery while digging foundation","LUCKNOW: A man carrying out digging for the foundation of his house in Hardoi stumbled upon a treasure trove of gold and silver ornaments encrusted with diamonds and rubies late Thursday. Police said the recovered jewellery was worth around Rs 27 lakh. The district administration has informed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in Lucknow about the recovery as it could be of historical importance. Superintendent of police, Hardoi, Alok Priyadarshi said, “According to jewellers, the ornaments are estimated to be worth Rs 27 lakh. Total 650 grams gold (worth Rs 23 lakh) and 6 kg silver (Rs 4 lakh) ornaments have been recovered along with brass worth several thousands of rupees.” Police said the house of Utkarsh, a sweet shop owner, was being constructed in Mohallah Khidkiya area of Sandi and digging work was on for laying of foundation. Station house officer, Sandi, Ram Lakhan said, “While the labourers were winding up the work on Thursday evening, some of them noticed a vessel buried under the ground. Out of curiosity, they dug the ground and recovered a brass pot.” “The news spread like wildfire in the village and soon people gathered there to catch a glimpse of the pot. In the meantime, silver ornaments were also recovered after which the police and district administration officials were informed,” he added. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: 8-year-old boy siphons off Rs 35,000 from father’s account for online game","LUCKNOW: An eight-year-old boy siphoned off Rs 35,000, in numerous instalments over nine months, from his father’s account to clear various levels of an online survival game and inch closer to the promised grand prize. The boy’s father, a temple priest in the city, noticed the missing money only after Rs 18,000 was debited from his bank savings account at one go. The father lodged a complaint with cyber police whose probe led to the startling discovery. Nodal officer of Lucknow police cyber cell Abhay Mishra said they received a complaint about an online fraud on August 17. “During investigations, it came to the fore that the complainant’s bank account was linked to an e-wallet through which payment was made to a third party in Mumbai. We also found that his mobile number was used for the transactions, which is possible only when the victim makes the mistake of sharing OTP in the event of fraudulent calls/ mails,” Mishra said. The catch in this case was that the priest denied receiving any such call or mail, and neither was his accounts hacked. So, the only other possibility was an insider role — people who had access to the victim’s phone. In other words, his wife and son. “We spoke to both. The woman, we found, could barely use a cellphone. The child, however, broke down when quizzed. He said he was hooked to this online game called Free Fire and spent his father’s money to qualify various levels,” Mishra said. 8-year-old had rented game for Rs 80In December 2018, the boy downloaded and rented the game for Rs 80. He played whenever his father was home. “The initial levels demanded Rs 500 or so each time. However, the boy said, after he cracked those stages, the game asked him to purchase virtual diamonds. Around August 14-15, I made a transaction worth Rs 18,000 to purchase the diamonds as prompted by the game,” he said in his statement. Police said after the case was cracked, the priest withdrew the complaint. Both father and child have been counselled. Free Fire is an online survival game that can be played on an Android platform. The last man standing wins a grand prize. "
Lucknow,"Twist in tale: Now, murder FIR lodged against IAS officer","LUCKNOW: The Anita Singh death case took a murky turn late on Thursday when her advocate cousin lodged an FIR, accusing her IAS officer husband Umesh Singh of extramarital affair and murder. The bureaucrat has rubbished charges and said he would lodge a counter-complaint for defamation and harassment against his brother-in-law Rajeev Kumar Singh. The couple’s two children, daughter aged 22 and son 20, have also accused their uncle of lying. Anita (42) died in her room at their Vikalp Khand home following a gunshot wound in the chest on September 1. Her family members told police she was suffering from chronic depression and shot herself with her licensed pistol. They said her door was locked from inside and was broken open to take her to hospital, where she was declared brought dead. After preliminary investigation, police too said it was a possible suicide. However, advocate Rajeev has raised unanswered questions in his FIR. One, he said, close inspection of the door latch indicated that it didn’t break when pushed from outside. Rather, it was deliberately broken later to suggest the door was locked from inside when the shot was fired. Second, the FIR said, there was no explanation on how Anita received a contusion on the back of her head. She fell on the sofa and not on any hard surface. And third, in case of normal perforating bullet injuries, the exit wound is always bigger than the entry wound. If Anita shot herself in the chest, why is that wound bigger than the one on her back from where the bullet supposedly exited her body? Rajeev’s FIR further said that his cousin was depressed for the past few years because of her husband’s relationship with other w “I last saw Anita with Umesh at the house-warming function of my brother in Gomtinagar two months ago. She was not dressed for the occasion and was also not wearing sindoor. That their relationship was under stress was pretty obvious,” he said. The advocate also questioned why Umesh allowed her to keep a loaded gun when she under medication for depression. On why he was taking interest in the case, Rajeev said Anita’s father was bedridden and she had no brother. “Hence, I have taken up the cudgels to fight out the truth,” he said, demanding a CBI probe and suspension of the IAS officer. Denying all the charges, Umesh called Rajeev “an opportunist” trying to get cheap publicity out of a family tragedy. “Since Anita and I were married 23 years ago, Rajeev never visited us; not even on Rakshabandhan or when she was hospitalised a few months ago,” the IAS officer said. The husband claimed he had kicked the door open because of which the latch broke. “The same has been examined by forensic experts,” he said, adding that he had no idea how his wife had hurt the back of her head. Umesh maintained that he had bought the pistol for Anita in February 2016 while she was diagnosed with depression in January 2018. “She was seeing a doctor in Delhi, Nilesh Tiwari, who told us it was because of hormonal changes in her body. Her pistol and my revolver were kept in an almirah in the storeroom. They were never used in three years; almost forgotten. I didn’t think she’d take it out one fine day,” he said. "
Lucknow,UP Woman given triple talaq for giving birth to girl,"LUCKNOW: A 30-year-old woman has accused her husband of giving her triple talaq after she gave birth to a girl child, in Rupaidiha area of Bahraich. Police said the complainant, Aquila Bano of Salarpur village, was married to Mohammed Hasan of the same village in 2012. “My husband wanted a son. In 2016, I gave birth to a girl child after which Hasan often thrashed me. He would often leave home and not return for months. In his absence, my in-laws tortured me,” Bano told police. “On August 26, I again gave birth to a girl. Agitated over this, Hasan hurled abuses at me and pronounced talaq thrice on the day of delivery,” she said. Station house officer, Rupaidiha, Manoj Pandey said an FIR had been lodged against Hasan, his parents and three others under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. "
Lucknow,Salt-roti meal expose: MDM audit to be held after 2 years,"LUCKNOW: With the salt-and-roti expose in Mirzapur embroiling the mid-day meal scheme in controversy, the government will conduct a quality audit of food served to children. This will be conducted by external agencies, including Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute, Lucknow University and Indian Institute of Management-Lucknow. A similar audit in 2016 by Giri Institute of Development Studies (GIDS), Lucknow, focused only on two districts. This time, the sample size has been raised and schools in 20 villages in each of the 75 districts will be taken into account. Till now, principals would inform government authorities on distribution of meal on phone.  Director, UP Mid-day Meal Authority, Vijay Kiran Anand, said, ""Now, we have roped in institutes and universities for a feedback on meals served to children and this will swiftly redress complaints of mismanagement."" Talks are underway with these institutes to hammer out modalities. Apart from nutrient value in food, the audit will find whether meals helped in raising enrolment and reducing dropout rate. The audit team will also check whether mid-day meal scheme has blurred caste and religion barriers among children, said officials. Officials claimed that Prerna App, launched on September 4, will also help in keeping an eye on the meals. ""Currently, principals would inform authorities on lunch served to students through an interactive voice response system. Now, they have to send selfies with students having food. This will help check irregularities,"" said the official. The 13-year-old Mid-day Meal Authority is in spotlight after a video of students being served salt and roti at a government-run primary school in Mirzapur district went viral on social media on August 22, triggering widespread outrage and leading to suspension of two teachers.

Police had found the body of Arun Tyagi on a secluded plot in Loni on Friday morning. The accused Ankit, Gaurav Khari and Peeyush are from Tronica City. On Thursday, they were fighting with Tyagi’s tenant outside his house when Tyagi asked them to leave. After they refused to do so, Tyagi and a few neighbours threw them out. SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said Tyagi had abused the trio in front of other people and they felt humiliated. On the same night, the accused had been drinking in a park when they planned to take revenge. “They had abducted Arun Tyagi from his house and taken him to a vacant plot. There, they beat him up and burnt his hands with cigarettes stubs. Arun Tyagi had slapped one of the accused in rage and tried to flee. But the accused picked up a heavy stone and hit Arun Tyagi several times in the head, killing him on the spot,” Jadaun added. The accused were arrested under Section 302 (murder) and they sent to Dasna jail after being produced in court. "
Ghaziabad,"Jail, bail and jail: Ghaziabad serial con artist back behind bars","GURUGRAM: A 27-year-old Ghaziabad resident, out on bail after he was arrested last month in Noida for posing as a PMO official, landed in prison again on Friday, this time in Gurugram where he had cheated a former colleague by impersonating a police officer. Gaurav Mishra was arrested last month in Noida because he had calling government officials posing as an IPS officer, a PMO official, the husband of an IAS officer and even a friend of a senior BJP functionary. He was using these fake identities to put pressure on these government officials to carry out transfers and postings for his anonymous clients. He has been in the police files since 2012 when he was caught influencing admissions to a private university using the same modus operandi. Mishra is from Allahabad. Police in Gurugram were looking for Mishra in their probe into a case filed by Lokesh Sharma, a resident of Sector 84. Sharma claimed he had got a call from Mishra, a former colleague, on Diwali 2014. Mishra told him over phone that after quitting the job at Sunil Auto in Uttarakhand where the two used to work together, he prepared for the civil service exam and became an IPS officer in 2012. He also claimed he was posted at the NIA headquarters in Delhi and was married to an IAS officer from his batch, Aniketa. “He made me talk to his wife over phone and she also verified his claims,” Sharma said in his complaint. But all of this was fabricated. “I kept receiving calls from Gaurav Mishra. On two occasions, he visited my house along with one R K Sharma who was wearing a police uniform and carrying his ‘service revolver’,” said Sharma, adding they also met at a pub on MG Road and Mishra tried to influence the pub owners by flaunting his identity. Soon, Mishra introduced him to a property dealer who claimed to be developing a residential project, ‘Golf Link’, in Greater Noida. Mishra claimed his wife and brother-in-law Ashutosh Rathi were partners in the project and offered to help Sharma get a 100 square yard plot for Rs 15 lakh. Sharma agreed and it was decided that he will pay Rs 9 lakh upfront and remaining Rs 8 lakh will be paid at the time of registry. By November 2015, he made the full payment and was assured that the plot will be registered in his name in no time. After taking the money, however, Mishra kept on delaying the registration. “Every time I called him, he said he is on a foreign trip or that he has been transferred,” said Sharma. Lokesh filed a complaint with the police and a case was registered at Kherki Daula police station in September last year under section 406 (fraud), 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC. He was arrested on Friday. "

Ransomware is a malware unleashed into a system by a hacker that blocks access to a user till the ransom amount is paid. The research scholar, who did not wish to be identified, lodged an FIR on September 3. “I started getting a series of emails from unknown sources in August. Initially, I ignored the mails thinking them to be unsolicited, but after a few weeks I opened a link which took me to a website after which my computer crashed,” he said. “Later, when I got the system restored I received a mail which said my email account and the files and documents of my computer have been hacked. The hacker said he would provide access codes only after I pay USD 1200 ransom,” the scholar added. In charge of Lucknow nodal cyber cell Abhay Mishra said police were trying to trace the hacker’s email address. Earlier on July 30, cyber criminals had encrypted the data of a private eye hospital in Krishnanagar and blocked details of patients entered in the database. They demanded Rs 75,000 for retrieval of data. Police failed to make headway in the case. In March, hackers blocked the data of a five-star hotel in the city and demanded ransom. The police traced the address of hackers to London but failed to make breakthrough. "
Lucknow,Writing women back into history,"When it comes to the Revolt of 1857, the heroic exploits of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi are pretty well-known but not those of a feisty Avadh queen who escaped to Nepal in the hope of fighting the enemy on another day. But that chance never came, and Begum Hazrat Mahal died in Nepal in 1879, unloved, uncared for, and poor. “She never surrendered and paid a high price for it, dying in penury. And yet she is forgotten and instead we remember her husband, Wajid Ali Shah, and recite his poetry with fondness and nostalgia even though he obeyed the British and abandoned Lucknow to live a life of indulgence in Calcutta,” says author Ira Mukhoty. Mukhoty, who studied natural sciences at Cambridge, isn’t a professional historian. She says she started with the sole motivation of finding Indian female role models for her two daughters to emulate. But as she started digging, she realised the extent to which women have been written out of history. “The more I discover the extent of the neglect of women’s voices, the more I feel it is essential to retrieve their histories. For so many centuries, we have privileged the spread of a certain type of history — the one about kings, about conquests, about territories and battles. Surely it is time now to question the very fundamental premise of what constitutes history,” says Mukhoty, whose first book ‘Heroines’ was on powerful Indian women from myth and history. Her latest is on lesser-known Mughal women whose tales were buried in the harem. Professor Ruby Lal, who teaches South Asian history at Emory University in the US and has recently authored a biography of Empress Nur Jahan, says that once she began to insert “she” into history, Mughal history began to turn upside down. “There emerged many more complex characters. History began to feel more vulnerable, more human, not fixed,” she says. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSSaudi's response on India's oil reserves 'undiplomatic': PradhanUnion minister for oil, petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday termed Saudi Arabia's response on India's strategic oil reserves as 'undiplomatic' and said that India is conscious about its interest.PM Modi invites 50 Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to visit IndiaAddressing Bangladesh's 50th Independence Day anniversary at the National Parade Square, Modi said: ""It is a happy coincidence that the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's liberation and the milestone of the 75th year of India's independence have arrived together.“It is the stringent and narrow politics in history writing — and an imagination that certain (read male) texts are somehow ‘sacred’ and ‘legitimate’ — that leaves out vast historical moments, experiences and actors,” Lal adds. Filmmaker Saba Dewan has written ‘Tawaifnama’ to put the tawaif or courtesan back into the historical narrative. With the coming of the British with their Victorian morality, the tawaifs were seen as prostitutes and markers of the inherent decadence of Indian society. “Even Gandhians internalised much of the Victorian morality, and while going out to prove that Indian society was not decadent, pushed the tawaifs further away from public life and historical record,” says Dewan. However, she disagrees with the characterisation that authors like her are ‘feminising’ history. “Including women’s voices is a way to make history more wholesome. It is a process of making women more visible in the historical narrative. You see, histories were mostly written by men. To capture women’s voices was not part of any written tradition. The history of the tawaifs was even more invisible as there was so much stigma attached to them,” Dewan says. Author Manu Pillai, who has also written about courtesans of the past in his latest book, ‘The Courtesan, The Mahatma, and the Italian Brahmin’, agrees with Dewan. “Women have always made profound contributions to history, but found themselves written out. In my new book, I highlight the work of courtesans — the poetry of Muddupalani, the business venture of Balamani, the journey of Begum Samru from dancing girl to protector of the Mughal emperor. These are women who made history, but because their bodies did not feature wedding lockets, and because they existed outside the framework of family, they have not been given their due,” Pillai says. He adds, “We have enshrined Mirabai as a Krishna bhakta but often forget her challenge to Rajput patriarchy. Or Janabai who was a kitchen maid but whose verses convey a frustration with women having to endure domestic shackles. Yes, their voices are couched in the rhetoric of religion, but these women were also radical thinkers. Their stories and their work deserve attention, devoid of moral judgement and on their own terms.” One wonders, though, about the fundamental problem: if women’s voices were not recorded, how do we retrieve them? Authors have to rely on generalisations and even conjecture at times. Author and entrepreneur Archana Garodia Gupta points out that often one has to rely on folk tales and legends to flesh out the stories, with all the attendant pitfalls. “Often women’s stories are deliberately erased. For instance, Ferozeshah Tughlaq removed Razia’s name from the lists he had compiled on Delhi’s sultans. One has to visit many sources to retrieve very scant mentions and bring it all together. For the story of Velu Nachiar, the sources I found were in Tamil — it was quite a task translating them,” says the author of ‘The Women Who Ruled India’. Lal says she had to study closely the complex iconography of art history, architectural histories and early-modern maps in the writing of her biography of Nur Jahan. “It’s not just about different sources: it’s also about the language of those sources, and what such languages can unfold for a historian. Mughal records were replete with discussions of Nur Jahan’s fabulous hunting. I had to ask what hunting meant in that time, particularly hunting of tigers. In the early modern monarchical world, it was a central symbol of sovereignty,” says Lal, the author of ‘Empress — The Astonishing Reign of Nur Jahan’. Gupta, though, warns about the temptation to produce hagiographies of women. “The characters and achievements of these women varied as much as any similar group of men. Many of these women made wrong decisions and were ruthless and cruel. We do not need to hide their faults — it is possible to be significant in spite of many failings, as any history about men demonstrates. I have a trio of queens who were really not very ‘nice’ people, but were very successful, and effective rulers — Queen Didda of Kashmir, Tarabai the Maratha, and Begum Samru of Sardana. Gupta can’t however, find fault with Rani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, even in the modern terms of political correctness. “She ruled the best governed state in India in the 18th century, in really very uncertain times,” Gupta says.

This wasn’t Jonita’s first trip to Kanpur. In the past too she has been to the city for performances but has never been able to fully explore the place. ""I have heard a lot about Kanpur’s famous chaat and sweets and I really want to try them. I wish that one day I could come to Kanpur and explore the Ganga ghats and markets of the city,"" says, Jonita, who’s loved the hospitality of the people in the city.

""Music has always been my key interest. I remember when I was growing up in Canada I used to watch a lot of music reality shows. Singers like Asha ji and Shreya (Ghoshal) used to impress me a lot. I used to watch their videos and used to mimic them. This is how my initial training of music started. Later I started training in Western classical music and finally I decided to move to Mumbai to try my luck in Bollywood."" ""What I liked about Bollywood was that it welcomed me with open arms and I also realised that if you are talented then there is no dearth of work for you in Bollywood,"" adds Jonita. Jonita who is known for singing in English, Hindi, Telugu, Gujarati and other languages is not just getting new singing offers in fact she also keeps on getting acting offers. ""All my friends say that I should try my luck in acting because I am a big time drama queen. Like any other girl, I also love creating a lot of drama in my life. At times my friends say that I should be an actor rather than a singer. Since the time I have started singing in Bollywood I have been getting a lot of acting offers. But singing is my first love and music is in my blood. It’s not that I don’t want to get in acting but presently singing is my focus,"" shares Jonita whose favourite singer is Arijit Singh. "

Lucknow,"Rain elusive, Lucknow to feel the heat until next weekend","LUCKNOW: A sweltering Saturday left city residents begging for respite, but a stingy rain god offered the briefest bout of shower possible after a hot and humid week. The ugly news is that the sultry weather will last at least another seven days or so. State Met director JP Gupta said the conditions might be favourable for moderate, but widespread rainfall next weekend. ""The monsoon trough line - a stream of small cyclonic circulations caused due to low pressure - is passing from over central India and resulting in excessive rainfall in the region. The trough is expected to gradually shift towards UP by next Friday,"" he said, adding that they expected ""fairly widespread rain (covering more than 75% of the state)"". Until next Saturday, one can expect one or two bouts of showers owing to moisture accumulation in the atmosphere, but the weather will largely remain hot and humid with a high discomfort index. The city has not been granted monsoon largesse this year, barring two spells of incessant rainfall from July 5 to 13 and again from August 23 to 25. In between, three favourable weather systems developed over the Bay of Bengal, but they ran out of steam before reaching the state. September in Lucknow is generally known for pleasant weather, but the city is still grappling with the merciless mercury. The maximum temperature on Saturday was 35.8°C, three notches above normal, while the minimum was 27.4°C, also two points above normal. Around 9.6mm rain in the afternoon did not provide any relief at all. In fact, it pushed up relative humidity to 97%, making the day uncomfortable. Sunday won't be any different. "
Lucknow,"UP: Dogs enter Sitapur school, attack girl","LUCKNOW: A pack of dogs entered a school in Sitapur and attacked a four-year-old girl, leaving her injured, reviving the haunting memories of a spate of attacks by feral dogs in 2018 in the district. The victim, identified as Chandni, an upper kindergarten student of Hira Public Inter College in Khairabad area of Sitapur, was rushed to the community health centre and is undergoing treatment. “Chandini went to drink water from the tap in the school playground around 9.30am on Friday, when staff and students heard her screams and rushed to help. They saw a pack of dogs attacking the girl,” said Khairabad SHO Ajay Yadav. The school teachers and support staff chased the dogs away, rescued the girl and took her to hospital. School principal, Vimlesh Kumar Dixit said he has given a written complaint to police, saying some miscreants had been slaughtering animals illegally near the school campus and selling meat. “The stench of rotting animal remains makes it difficult for students to study. Moreover, birds swoop on the shops and drop flesh pieces on school campus,” he added. “The dogs leap over the boundary and enter our premises in search of flesh and attack students in the playground. The stench of rotting flesh becomes unbearable. When it increases, it makes children fall sick,” Dixit said in his complaint. SHO Yadav denied the allegations of any illegal meat shops running near the school, but said that remains of dead animals were found dumped near the school by police. “We are trying to work out a solution to stop locals from dumping animal carcasses at the spot,” he added.

Ghaziabad,Nandi Park’s bulls double in six months,"GHAZIABAD: The number of bulls and oxen has nearly doubled at Nandi Park in the last six months after UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath issued a diktat in January that stray cattle should be shifted to shelter homes. Spread over 15 acres of land, Nandi Park, India’s first cattle shed for bulls and oxen, was set up in 2009 in Raj Nagar Extension. Officials said after the CM’s order, residents — not only from Ghaziabad but also from neighbouring Delhi — have been abandoning cows, bulls and a large number of calves at the shed’s gate and near the Delhi-Ghaziabad border at night. The shed, which had 500-600 bulls and oxen at the beginning of the year, now has about 1,150. It has a capacity of 1,500. However, the amount fixed by the state government to feed the bulls and oxen at the centre is meagre, adding to the woes of the cash-strapped Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC). “The daily budget is Rs 30 per animal, which is less than half of the amount required to feed a bull or ox. At least 6 kg of straw and 3 kg of bran, besides green fodder, are needed to feed a bull every day, and altogether it costs around Rs 80. We have been seeking people’s participation in providing green fodder, but it is not much at present. A month ago, a bank account was opened under the name Society of People for Animal Welfare where people could make donations,” said a GMC official. Ghaziabad chief veterinary officer Brijendra Tyagi said a letter has been sent to the state government urging it to increase the daily budget to Rs 70 per animal. “What the government is giving is assistance. The GMC, which manages the park, uses its funds to operate it. If the funds are increased the corporation would be able to take better care of animals,” he said. To keep a tab, the animals are being tagged, said Tyagi. Owners can also be fined if they are caught abandoning cattle, he added. Apart from this, the government had approved a scheme, Nirashrit/Besahara Govansh Sahbhagita, under which such animals would be given for adoption to farmers who would be paid Rs 900 per animal each month. The government has earmarked nearly Rs 110 crore for the first phase of the scheme. "

Anita Singh (42) died of a gunshot wound on September 1 at her house in Vikalp Khand in Gomtinagar under Chinhat police station. Based on the statements of her family members and the postmortem report, police said Anita who was suffering from depression shot herself with her licensed pistol. However, Anita's cousin and advocate Rajeev lodged an FIR on Friday, accusing Umesh of killing his wife because she didn't approve of his extramarital affair. Rajeev demanded CBI intervention and the SUDA director's suspension for free and fair probe.

It was, however, postponed. ""Rajeev wanted favours from me that required bending of rules as SUDA director. So, I refused. Since he was my brother-in-law, I did not report his uncalled for behaviour to police,"" Umesh said in his complaint, adding his wife's cousin never visited her when she was alive and ill. ""Rajeev has also not visited Anita's bedridden father, Ram Singh, who is being taken care of by our family.""

Ghaziabad,NHAI to develop four-lane Hapur-Meerut road to take pressure off new expressway,"GHAZIABAD: Anticipating congestion once all phases of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) are opened for traffic, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is developing a portion of NH-235 so that it can serve as an alternative route to the Hapur-Meerut stretch of the high-speed corridor. By October-end, work will be completed, officials said. “The vehicular load on the DME and NH-9 is expected to increase on the completion of the expressway. So, an alternative route to Meerut from Hapur, which falls on NH-235, is being developed,” said RP Singh, NHAI project director. “The entire NH-235 is a 60km-long stretch connecting Bulandshahr to Meerut via Hapur, and NHAI is spending Rs 868 crore to strengthen the stretch of which 30km Hapur to Meerut section is a part of it. The 30km portion, which will connect Hapur to Meerut, would be a four-lane stretch and we hope to complete it by October-end,” he said. Explaining the importance of an alternative route to the Hapur-Meerut stretch of the DME, Singh said that Meerut-bound commuters from Delhi will take the DME from Sarai Kale Khan to Dasna in Ghaziabad before commencing on the 30km route to Merrut. “A commuter heading towards Merrut will also have the option to take NH-235 from Hapur,” he said. TOI had on Saturday reported that NHAI might miss its December deadline to complete the Dasna to Meerut stretch of the DME as work on a 4km stretch of the 31km corridor has not yet begun due to an ongoing probe into a land scam. The problem stems from the fact that the Ghaziabad district administration has initiated an investigation after it came to light that some officials who were in the know of things before the announcement of the DME project purchased land in the name of their relatives at low rates from local farmers and subsequently sold the same to the state government at higher rates. The 14-lane DME is divided into two parts — there are three lanes on either side (total six), which is called the DME, and eight lanes in the middle, which is called NH-9. The expressway will do away with 31 traffic signals on the Delhi-Meerut road, the busiest highway in the region, and make it signal-free. "

Lucknow,Lucknow has always been very special : Salim Arif,"Theatre director-producer and Lucknowite Salim Arif, an alumnus of the National School of Drama (NSD), New Delhi, is happy beyond words for being chosen for the prestigious Uttar Pradesh Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for his contribution to theatre direction. Salim, who has been a part of the Lucknow theatre scene of the 1970’s, is known for plays like 'Taj Mahal Ka Tender', 'Dil Chahta Hai', 'Agar Aur Magar', 'Humsafar', 'Paansa', 'Pinocchio' and 'Tera Bayaan Ghalib' among many others. Speaking of the award, which has taken its time coming his way, Salim, on his recent visit to Lucknow said, “It’s always an honour to be acknowledged for whatever you have been doing. I believe that if you keep working, sooner or later, the accolades will come to you. I’m grateful for being felicitated in my hometown, especially from the institution where I started my journey.” The theatre veteran then went on a trip down memory lane and said, “I studied at the Lucknow University when it was full of culture and art. It had a very lively atmosphere with some brilliant teachers. Then there were also people like Amritlal Nagar, KN Kakkar, Kunwar Narayan, Jagriti Ji and so on. They were all part of the theatre scene, right from actively participating to watching the plays. Some of the top Hindi poets were working in the newspaper here. Lucknow had a very vibrant cultural scene in the late ’70s and early ’80s which got me totally hooked.” He further added, “Lucknow has always been very special and given half a chance I would love to come and work here again. I have spent most of my life here and it’s my favourite place to be. I just need someone to organise some work for me here.” Although many films are being shot in the state and especially in Lucknow these days, Salim believes that Lucknow has missed the bus, “We should have had a film school in the mid-90s if not earlier. I still feel that Lucknow needs a very good film school. Lucknow is one of the most conducive places to shoot and that’s probably why all these films are being made here now. Besides, you get such good actors here too. It’s just sad that they become character actors, had they been in Mumbai, they would’ve been lead actors. It’s high time we do something about it. We badly need a training programme because all these web channels and productions need trained professionals,” he said. Salim Arif at BNA, Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Salim Arif at BNA, Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Salim went on to confess how lucky he feels to have had such a rich journey. “Going to Mumbai and trying another domain like television was another milestone, I feel. Having had the chance to work with legends like Gulzaar saab and Shyam Benegal was just the icing on the cake. I feel very grateful.” Salim Arif with Gulzar at Lucknow (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Salim Arif with Gulzar at Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Salim also holds the unique distinction of someone having a very close relationship with writer-lyricist Gulzar. The National Award and Oscar winner writer refers to Salim as his son. It was then obvious that Gulzar would be the most happy at Arif being given the UPSNA award. Speaking to us from Mumbai, especially about this Gulzar said, “This award has come late in the day for Salim. He should have been awarded much earlier for his contribution to theatre. But I am so very glad that he has finally been recognised by his home state. He is most worthy of it. It’s a matter of pride and I am very-very proud of Salim. Theatre is his passion and the way he presents his plays is beautiful. The best part about his direction is that he keeps the tone and the voice of the writer in its original form. He will adapt the play in such a way that the original thought and individuality of the writer comes through which not all directors do. I call him the Habib Tanvir of these times. The younger generation should learn from Salim.” — Yashi Agarwal, with inputs by Itishree.Misra@timesgroup.com "

Jethmalani did not bargain for the rough treatment meted to him but the assault by Chandrashekhar's men could do little to faze the lawyer. As Singh led Janata Dal to victory against Congress, Jethmalani had the satisfaction that in the Bofors-powered polls of 1989, his daily 10 questions to then PM Rajiv Gandhi had helped set the public mood. Unbridled anti-Congressism defined the lifelong political commitment of the man who otherwise was not always known for consistency. Jethmalani was fairly young when Emergency was imposed and he came out strongly against it. His detention order forced him into exile overseas but he contested the 1977 elections from Bombay North-West where he romped home against law minister HR Gokhale, a key architect of Emergency who infamously oversaw suspension of habeus corpus. He retained the seat in 1980, finally losing to actor-turned-politician Sunil Dutt in 1984. But his blazing, unmitigated anti-Congressism ensured lifelong friends in the opposition. Often coming across as irascible, he was a man led by his passions. He once told a group of striking journalists - accused of being hand in glove with the VP Singh government's opponents - ""you don't look like Congress agents!"" He took up legal briefs of leaders in the crosshairs of the law. This ensured his net spread wide, ensuring six terms in Rajya Sabha during a long career. It included support of as 'secular' a politician as RJD chief Lalu Prasad whom he defended in the fodder scam as also BJP chief Amit Shah. There was a time when he even launched a political platform, Bharat Mukti Morcha, a non-starter. Forever on the threshold of a political jackpot, Jethmalani's day came when the legal eagle became law minister in the Vajpayee government. However, his independent style and attack dog ways led him into a confrontation with the then CJI RS Anand. Finally, Vajpayee dropped him, telling Parliament, ""I should have the freedom to decide my cabinet."" Jethmalani was shocked and never forgave his successor, late Arun Jaitley, who he felt had sided with CJI Anand. Later, he contested against Vajpayee from Lucknow in 2004. He took up AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal's brief against a defamation case filed by Jaitley, but went so overboard in his cross-examination that the chief minister had to distance himself. Unsurprisingly, Jethmalani then turned on Kejriwal. Jethmalani was his own man and did not need a political perch to be noticed. He plodded through politics and stayed in the news. In 2012, he spoke against BJP leaders in Delhi by accusing them of compromise with ""corruption under Congress"" and was suspended from the party for six years. But soon, he was back, making black money a political issue and while he backed Narendra Modi, he later accused the leader of not doing enough. It was a typical about turn, indicating his individualism that came in the way of sustained engagement with party or government. Jethmalani had a way of bouncing back and but for his recent age related health complications, would never be out of limelight for long. "
Lucknow,"'Opponents feared Ram, judges were in awe of him'","By Kapil SibalOn Sunday morning at 7.45am, Ram Jethmalani took a flight to his benefactor from the departure lounge of life. Born on September 14, 1923, he died a few days before his 96th birthday. I remember Ram in his many avatars. He was an extraordinary lawyer with a razor sharp mind who stooped to conquer the many legal battles he fought. He was a voracious leader with a love for literature. His daily routine included a few games of badminton every evening and a drink thereafter, during which he chatted with his friends who came to be energised by his vigour and love for life. He obtained his LLB degree at the age of 17 and started practising law in his hometown in Pakistan. With partition, he moved to Bombay as a refugee and began life afresh. With one paisa in his pocket, he stayed in a refugee camp for a few days and thereafter charted his own destiny. He came to the spotlight as a lawyer when he assisted public prosecutor CM Trivedi in framing arguments in the famous Nanavati trial. He never looked back thereafter. It was a privilege for me when he approached me sometime in 1986 to argue a writ petition filed by him in a proceeding against Swaraj Paul. I remember him sitting by my side instructing me as I argued that case. Since then, we became close friends. He always treated me with great affection. The quality that I most admired in Ram was his commitment to the cause that he took up and his ability to be fearless in defending that cause. Least concerned about what others might say, he always fought to win. He was indefatigable. His conferences would start in the morning and he would sit through the day putting to shame young lawyers who found it tiresome. His mastery over facts and the Evidence Act was legendary. His forensic abilities and originality of mind won him admiration whenever he stood up in court. The opponents feared him and judges were in awe of him. He later developed into a fine constitutional lawyer. He also had the ability to take up unpopular cases. He defended Afzal Guru. Despite public sentiment, he continued to defend Manu Sharma in the Jessica Lal murder case. He was unfazed by criticism when defending Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parekh in the stock market scams. Some of his other famous clients included J Jayalalithaa, Jaganmohan Reddy, B Yediyurappa, Ramdev and Asaram Bapu in the Jodhpur sexual assault case. Very few know that he did a lot of pro-bono work. He had a mercurial temperament. He was a bundle of affection for those who he liked and a fierce enemy for those who he thought harmed him and his reputation. Just as in the law, he was a political maverick. Since 1988, he continued to be in the Rajya Sabha. He could change sides based on his changing perception of political parties. One could have never imagined that Ram would be a candidate against Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the 2004 Lok Sabha election from Lucknow. He had entered politics with the support of the BJP and was very close to LK Advani. Because of his outspoken nature and his criticism of stalwarts in the BJP, he was eventually expelled from the party in May 2013. Eventually, BJP withdrew his expulsion realising that it is better to befriend him than to be the object of his wrath. He never gave up in defending his clients except on one occasion as counsel for Sanjay Dutt who was being prosecuted under TADA. He made several unsuccessful attempts to get him bail. One day, he held my hand and told me that may be, he is not lucky for Sanjay and that it might be better if someone else tried his luck. That is how Dutt Saheb asked me to defend his son. He always believed that his client deserved to get relief from the court and would seldom come to terms if his client was denied relief. That was the nature of his commitment to the cause he represented. He was a giant in the field of law. He charted his own course in life and stuck to the principles that he believed in. He measured others by the yardstick of values that he embraced. He was unconventional in every sense of the word. It is because he always fought against the tide that he was often misunderstood. He was a man with a golden heart who savoured each moment of his life. (The writer is a senior advocate and Congress leader)"
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: ‘Auto gang’ robs woman of cash, mobile","GHAZIABAD: A 40-year-old woman was allegedly robbed of cash worth Rs 2,000 and her mobile phone by an ‘auto gang’ in Sihani Gate area on Saturday. The victim, Rakhi Singh, lives in Nehru Nagar 2. Around 9 am on Saturday, she sat in a shared auto near Old Bus St-and to go to a clinic in Noida for treatment. Singh told police the auto had a driver and three other men posing as regular passengers. After driving for a distance, the driver stopped as the person sitting next to him insisted on sitting in the rear. The driver also agreed with him saying the police will issue a challan if they find someone sitting on the front seat, the woman alleged. Singh, meanwhile, protested saying there was no space for a fourth person at the back. While she was speaking to the driver, a passenger at the back opened her purse. She asked the driver to let her get down, but he started the vehicle. Singh was pushed her out of the moving auto and sustained injuries. She raised an alarm but no one came to her rescue. She even caught hold of the vehicle and was dragged for some distance. She finally let go of the vehicle when the driver increased the speed. The mobile phone and cash kept in the purse were later found to be missing. Based on her complaint, an FIR for theft was registered against unidentified persons at Sihani gate police station. "
Lucknow,'Improve law and order for more investment',"LUCKNOW: The Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow on Sunday laid out a road map for the UP government to turn the state into a $ 1 trillion dollar economy, months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set the ambitious target at an investors' meet here. The roadmap was laid out after a marathon 10-hour session on leadership development on the IIM-L campus. The issue was raised at a presentation made by Prof Sanjay Singh, a faculty in Business Environment, during his deliberation on the economic context at global level, national level and that of the state level. The presentation also dwelt upon comparison of UP with top four states in India on key parameters. IIM-L director Archana Shukla said that UP happens to be the spine of the country. ""Development of UP would strengthen the country as a whole,'' she said, adding that people have great expectations from politicians and the programme would help achieve this. IIM-L laid specific stress on agri growthThe IIM-L faculty essentially focused on key economic parameters that could potentially put UP on a higher growth trajectory. A senior cabinet minister who attended the session told TOI that the faculty laid stress on betterment of infrastructure that included road connectivity, better electricity and irrigation. They also emphasized on ensuring a robust law and order situation so that more and more investment could reach the state and industrialization could gather pace. The faculties also elaborated on strengthening the micro, small, medium enterprises (MSMEs) to boost the state economy. UP government spokesperson and cabinet minister Siddharthnath Singh said that IIM-L laid specific stress on growth of agriculture and dairy development to boost the rural economy and thereby that of state as a whole. “Agriculture needs to be taken to the next level,'' Singh said, while speaking to TOI. He said that the issue of health and hygiene that could improve the human capital also cropped up during the discussion. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Toxic paint from Ganpati idols harming Gomti health,"LUCKNOW: As devotees bade adieu to Ganesha on Sunday, thousands of idols being immersed in the Gomti waters along with organic puja paraphernalia raised serious pollution concerns among civic officials and river crusaders alike. According to LMC environment engineer Pankaj Bhushan, more than 15,000 big and small idols have been immersed in the river over the past couple of days and more will be done till Tuesday. That most of these idols are made of plaster of Paris (POP) and toxic paint has sounded the alarm. “POP is basically calcium sulphate hemihydrate, which takes five to six years to completely dissolve in water. Flower remains, on the other hand, reduce the dissolved oxygen level in the river. And, paints have lead and mercury, besides chemicals that are detrimental to the health of aquatic flora and fauna,” the environment engineer said. Environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta said around 6kg of POP is used to make a 4ft idol in addition to eight litre of artificial paint. “Thermocol is used to make ornaments while around 3kg metal goes into making the idol base,” he pointed out. A study, recently conducted by Dutta, showed that the dissolved oxygen (DO) of Gomti had plummeted to 0-1mg/litre along some stretches, thanks to sewers draining into the river. To support aquatic life, the concentration of DO should be 5mg/litre. The immersions at Jhulelal Vatika and Kudiya Ghat are likely to affect the river health further. Devotees, on the other hand, complained of filthy ghat surroundings. “There is so much garbage that walking is difficult without tripping over dirty plastic Trash cans are overflowing,” said Vineet Saini at Jhulelal Vatika. Prakash Mishra at Kudiya Ghat said they were compelled to dump flowers and other used puja paraphernalia into the river because there were “no proper arrangements to dispose of leftovers”. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow drunk man fires at mom-in-law after fight with wife, shoots self","LUCKNOW: A 40-year-old man allegedly fired at his mother-in-law before shooting himself, following an argument with his wife in Gomtinagar Extension, early Sunday morning. While the victim died on the spot, his mother-in-law Chanda Devi sustained injuries on her thighs. Police said the deceased Abhishek Singh married Pragya in 2005 and the couple had a daughter Shanvi (11). The family lived with a domestic aide in an apartment complex. Abhishek had been working with a private firm, but he lost his job eight months ago due to a health issue. He had been depressed ever since and often drank a lot. Around 12.30am on Sunday, a drunk Abhishek reportedly picked up a fight with Pragya.  She sent her daughter downstairs with the domestic help, lest her husband hurt them. She then called Chanda, who reached Pragya's home along with her own daughter-in-law Anamika a few minutes later. Abhishek flew into a fit of rage after seeing Chanda. ""He asked Chanda to stay away as it was a personal matter for the couple,"" Shanvi told the police. ""He then took out his licensed revolver and fired four-five shots. One of the bullets hit my grandmother. My mother tried to stop papa, but he pushed her aside. He put the pistol against his temple and pulled the trigger,"" said Shanvi. Hearing the gunshots, a security guard posted at the complex informed the police. SHO (Gomtimagar) Amit Dubey said Abhishek and Chanda were rushed to Civil Hospital, but doctors declared the former brought dead. Chanda's condition is currently stable. ""We have seized Abhishek's licensed revolver,"" he added. Circle officer (Gomtinagar) Avineshwar Srivastava said as none of the sides have levelled any allegations of foul play, hence no case has been registered. "

Lucknow,"Truck drivers in lungi to invite Rs 2,000 fine in Uttar Pradesh","LUCKNOW: The humble lungi, the arguable “comfort attire” of truck drivers across India, is under serious glare in Uttar Pradesh. Drivers and helpers of all commercial vehicles in the state will have to cough up Rs 2,000 if caught wearing lungi and vest, the steep penalty under new provisions of the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act meant to strictly implement a dress code that has been in existence for decades, but never enforced. The drivers will have to sport full-length pants paired with shirts/tees and also wear shoes when behind the wheel. The new provisions also push for uniforms for drivers of all school vehicles. ASP (Traffic), Lucknow, Poornendu Singh told TOI that the dress code was part of the MV Act since 1939 and when the act was amended in 1989, a penalty of Rs 500 was introduced for violation of the same. “Now, a fine of Rs 2,000 will be imposed for dress code violation under Section 179 of the MV Act, 2019,” Singh said, adding that the rule and penalty were applicable on school vehicle drivers as well. Additional transport commissioner of UP Gangaphal told TOI that the central MV Act gave states the power to formulate certain traffic safety rules and pull up those who ignored these rules. “Under the law, driving trucks, tractors and other such heavy and light commercial vehicles wearing lungi and vest is not permitted. One must wear full pants, proper shirt and closed shoes. The rule applies to helpers or conductors too,” he said, adding that government vehicle drivers would not be spared either if they violated the dress code. "
Lucknow,Former UP CM Kalyan Singh to rejoin BJP today,"LUCKNOW: After serving a full five-year term as Rajasthan governor, former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh is set to rejoin BJP formally on Monday. BJP sources said that Kalyan, whose tenure as Rajasthan governor ended on September 3, is expected to reach Lucknow on Monday itself and head straight to UP BJP headquarters where he would be formally inducted in party in the presence of state BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh. Kalyan's rejoining is being seen as BJP's attempt to woo OBCs, especially Lodh community, ahead of upcoming bypolls for 13 assembly seats and subsequent state elections in 2022. Kalyan's return comes soon after ex-governor Ram Naik joined BJP after completing his term at the Raj Bhawan in Lucknow last month.  ""Kalyan Singh ji is one of the tallest leaders and has his ears to the ground. He is well versed with the political situation in UP. His rich experience will help the party in big way,"" said UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi. One of the fire brand Hindutva faces of BJP and an accused in Babri Masjid demolition case, Kalyan is likely to face trial for criminal conspiracy again as now he doesn't have the immunity for holding a gubernatorial post. On April 19, 2017, the Supreme Court had revived criminal conspiracy charges against senior BJP leaders L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharati. The apex court, however, said that Singh, who was UP CM when Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992, could not be brought to face trial due to the constitutional immunity granted to governors under Article 361 of the Constitution during their term of office. The Supreme Court, however, told the CBI to call Kalyan Singh as an accused as soon as he ceases to be governor. "

Kanpur,UP biker fined for not wearing ‘seat belt in Bihar’,"KANPUR: A Kanpur Nagar Nigam employee has received an e-challan for a vehicle in Patna, Bihar, that he does not even own. Pradeep Kumar, a resident of Nawabganj who has a two-wheeler, received the challan for a car on his cellphone from Patna police last Monday. It mentions he is being pulled up for not wearing a seat belt. A little probe revealed that the e-challan was actually meant for a vehicle owned by a Patna resident. Oddly though, the fourwheeler’s registration number is similar to that of his two-wheeler. On Friday, Pradeep met traffic SP Sushil Kumar who asked him to alert Patna police. “Someone in Patna is using a forged registration number. I am in the process of filing a complaint with Patna police,” Pradeep said. Traffic SP Kumar confirmed the bizarre case. “We have asked Patna police to step up vigil and track down the car that has same registration number as a two-wheeler belonging to a Kanpur resident,” the SP said.

Ghaziabad,7-step process set to speed up land mafia cases in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: Aiming to provide relief to scores of people who have been duped by land mafia, the district administration has devised a seven-step process to resolve such cases. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said from September 21, complainants can obtain the application form from the tehsil office free of cost. The complaint will then be scrutinised by sub-registrar office and tehsildar. In subsequent steps, it will be investigated by the sub-divisional magistrate, police and finally by the additional district magistrate. A software is also being developed for receiving cases related to land disputes online, the DM added. “Being next to the national capital, land in Ghaziabad remains in high demand. The land mafia takes advantage of this and dupes unsuspecting buyers. People from all sections of society are victims of this scam. In several cases, buyers are duped by the land mafia in connivance with government officials,” Pandey said. He said the main focus is Loni, where the land mafia has been most active. “We have been working in this area for the past one and a half months and found that land mafia has sold a single plot of land to several people and registered plots to people with forged power of attorney. There have been cases where government land has been occupied and sold,” the DM said. Scores of complaints are being registered every day with the chief minister’s portal, Integrated Grievance Redressal System (IGRS), as well as during tehsil divas and jan sunwais, Pandey said. The land mafia is also active in Vijay Nagar, Murad Nagar and Modi Nagar. In some cases, police have booked the accused under stringent UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act. About the need for a new complaint form, the DM said that at present, the complaints which are being received do not contain all the information and agencies concerned conduct inquiries separately. This not only wastes time, but also makes it difficult to reach a conclusion, he said. Under the proposed system, all the agencies will work together and fill the details in a single form, which will ensure proper monitoring too, he added. Soon after assuming charge in 2017, the Yogi Adityanath government had vowed to take on land mafia in the state and free government lands. An anti-land mafia task force was constituted for this purpose. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: 22 Crossings societies don’t have completion certificates,"GHAZIABAD: Twenty two out of 31 group housing societies in Crossings Republik are yet to get completion certificates from the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA). The agency has issued notices to builders warning it would cancel their map approvals if they do not apply for the certificate within a month. The notice states that it is against the rules to hand over flats to residents in the absence of completion certificates. Sushil Kumar Chaubey, GDA officer on special duty, said, “In case the builders do not respond to our notice, action will be taken against them under relevant sections of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Planning and Development Act.” According to a GDA report, out of 31 group societies in Crossings Republik, 24 have formed the Apartment Owners’ Association (AOA), but only two have been handed over the maintenance by the builders. The developers have also been directed to help in the formation of the AOAs. Under the UP Urban Planning and Development Act, builders are required to complete the development according to the approved plan and obtain a completion certificate from the authority to show that they have not violated any rules or diverted from the layout approved by GDA. Before applying for the completion certificate, the developers have to ensure that proper space for road construction and green belt has been made in accordance with the master plan. The builders also have to obtain no-objection certificates from the fire department, electricity department, UP Pollution Control Board for the fire safety arrangements, lifts and environmental clearance, respectively. Besides providing proper arrangements for parks, community centres and parking, among other amenities, builders are also required to comply with solid waste management rules, installation of sewage treatment plant and rainwater harvesting system. Taurn Chauhan, the president of Crossings Republik Owners and Members Association, said, “It has been our long-pending demand from the developers. Even GDA had not paid heed to this. Without completion certificate, we are treated as illegal occupants. Several societies are facing issues related to malfunctioning lifts and poor structural maintenance.” "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Cop stops SUV on wrong side, thrashed","GHAZIABAD: A 23-year-old man driving his SUV on the wrong side allegedly beat up a traffic police constable who tried to stop him near a roundabout in Sihani Gate area on Saturday. Tarun Tyagi, a college student and resident of Patel Nagar III, was arrested on Sunday. According to a complaint by constable Pradeep Kumar, the cop was on duty at Seth Mukund Lal Inter-College crossing on Hapur Road when he saw a Fortuner coming from the wrong direction around 2.30pm. He signalled the driver to stop the vehicle, but instead, he tried to hit the cop with the car. Kumar said he jumped aside to save himself. Tarun and three-four of his friends got down from the vehicle and allegedly abused him. When the constable objected to their behaviour, they allegedly thrashed him, tore his uniform and also tried to throttle him before fleeing. The FIR was subsequently registered against Tarun and his unidentified accomplices under IPC sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) at Sihani Gate police station. Umesh Bahadur Singh, the SHO of Sihani Gate police station, said the accused was arrested on the basis of the complaint registered by the constable. “We are trying to identify the remaining accused,” the officer added. In Ghaziabad, challans are being issued on the basis of old traffic violation fines as the UP government is yet to issue a notification revising the steeper penalties prescribed under the Centre’s Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, which became applicable from September 1. A traffic cop said driving on the wrong side comes under the rash driving category and attracts a penalty of Rs 2,500 at present. "
Lucknow,When Namish and Meera made ice cream rolls in Lucknow,"Making the most of their visit, 'Swaragini' fame Namish Taneja and 'Udaan' fame Meera Deosthale already knew what they had to do in the free time that they had before their press conference in Lucknow. The two decided to go to a well-known ice cream parlour in Gomti Nagar and try their hands at making ice cream rolls. Excited Namish and Meera first learned and keenly observed the process of making the rolls and then both made some roles for themselves. ""It isn’t that difficult too, I thought yeh bahut mushkil hone waala hai. Waise toh I have eaten ice cream rolls in Mumbai, but never have I ever got a chance to make them. So this time I thought ki let me try making these yummy rolls,"" shared Meera. While Meera made most of the ice cream rolls, Namish was seen lending a helping hand to her. ""I am not that good in all this. So I was standing with Meera and helping her in making the rolls. Main part of the ice cream making was taken care of by her,"" added Namish. Meera, recalling her childhood days, shared, ""Ice cream was a big part of my childhood. I used to get cough every time I had an ice cream, so my mom stopped buying me ice cream but that didn’t stop me from eating it. I then used to secretly get money from home and eat ice creams on a daily basis. I used to have orange bars and that thing too that came in plastic wrappers which you had to sip. Plus, I just loved softies, those ice cream lollipops were also one among my favourites."" Meera Deosthale and Namish Taneja having ice cream rolls in the city (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Meera Deosthale and Namish Taneja having ice cream rolls in the city (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) While Namish said, he had an ice cream factory in his neighbourhood and he had befriended all the workers in the factory just to get free ice creams. ""We tried our hands at making the ice cream and god it was tough and we loved the process, more than the process we loved eating it afterwards. It all got nostalgic as mere ghar ke paas factory bhi thi jahan pe woh 2 rupees wali orange bars banti thi, so I have spent my childhood having those orange bars,"" said Namish. The two actors were in Lucknow to promote their show 'Vidya'. Talking to us about her last show Udaan, Meera shared how she wasn’t ready to play a mother to a grown-up in the serial and hence quit the show. ""Doing a role of a mother of 20-year old needs some extra maturity. I mean I’m just 23 years old and I think I played exceptionally well when I had an eight months old kid and an eight-year-old kid in the show. But I had to play a mother to a 20-year old girl standing in front of me who actually was older than me was a bit unreasonable. I am not in that state of the mind where I have to play a mother to a grown-up,"" said Meera. Namish, who plays a District Magistrate in this serial, says he has gone for a complete makoever to get into the character. ""In my last show, 'Main Mayke Chali Jaungi, Tum Dekte Rahiyo', I had a long beard and long hair. So I decided to be more like a gentleman and I went for a haircut jiske wajah se bahut issue hua tha channel ke saath mera. They said ke yeh kya kar liya, hamein toh wahi chahiye tha. So I told them that if I choose any character, I make sure I do most of the things myself because it is said that dil ki suno toh zyada achha hota hai. They just said ke pahle poochhna chahiye tha hamse. But I got saved after maine baal waal sahi kar ke unko dikhaya aur kaha ke dekho lag raha hoon magistrate and they eventually agreed,"" shared Namish. — Akash.Wadhwa@timesgroup.com and Saad Abbasi "

Lucknow,Babri heat on Kalyan a day after he demits governor’s office,"LUCKNOW: A day after Kalyan Singh demitted office as governor of Rajasthan, the CBI on Monday moved an application before the special CBI court in Lucknow seeking to summon him as an accused to face trial along with others for allegedly conspiring to demolish the Babri mosque in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. The investigating agency had been waiting for Kalyan Singh to demit office as governor of Rajasthan, which he did on Sunday at the end of his term, in view of the constitutional immunity from prosecution granted to governors. The CBI special court is conducting the trial and the other accused include former deputy PM L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharati. The court took up the application and inquired from the CBI, for the record, whether Singh no longer held the constitutional post of governor. Since the trial is being conducted on a day-to-day basis, the CBI application may be taken up on September 11. The CBI pleaded that Singh was chargesheeted in 1993. It said that the Supreme Court, in its order of April 19, 2017, had said that Singh, who was Uttar Pradesh CM when the Babri masjid was demolished in 1992, could not be brought in as an accused to face trial in view of the constitutional immunity granted to governors under Article 361 of the Constitution. The SC had, however, allowed the CBI to move to summon him as an accused as soon as he ceased to be a governor. All the accused are on bail. The CBI had filed a chargesheet against the accused, including Singh, in 1993. Singh became governor on September 3, 2014, for a five-year term, which is now complete. "
Lucknow,Ashura today: Pebbles &amp; trash mar procession route,"LUCKNOW: Mourners are set to take out Ashura procession on Tuesday but the 8-km route from Victoria Street in Chowk to Talkatora Karbala lies in a shambles despite the directives of district administration officials for its repair. Over a lakh devotees are expected to walk barefoot to participate in the procession. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma had on August 31 directed the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) to repair potholes and catch stray animals after Shias, led by mutawalli of Sibtainabad Imambada Mohammad Haidar, wrote to the state government and district administration drawing their attention to the condition on the route. The DM had also asked the UP Bridge Corporation to remove barricades put up for construction of a flyover. Though the bridge corporation removed barricading and LMC conducted a drive to catch stray animals, TOI found in a reality check that the stretch is riddled with potholes. “We have requested the ADM (west) to make some arrangements to cover potholes if they cannot repair it in a day,” Mohammad Haidar said. Additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh said, “We have issued orders for road repair which will be done today itself. If we fail to fill all potholes, we will lay ‘durries’ to ensure that mourners do not face any inconvenience during the procession.” Ashura procession is taken out on the 10th day of Islamic month of Muharram to remember and mourn the martyrdom of Husain Ibn Ali, grandson of Prophet Muhammad and third Imam of Shias, at the battle of Karbala in 640AD. In Lucknow, people from all walks of life and religion take part in the procession. "
Lucknow,CBI seeks summoning of Kalyan Singh in Babri case,"LUCKNOW: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday moved an application before the special CBI court at Lucknow, conducting trial of accused persons including former deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti and others for conspiring to demolish the Babri structure at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, seeking summoning of former chief minister and governor Kalyan Singh also as an accused in the case to face trial. The court took up the application and inquired from the CBI about the record that Kalyan Singh is no longer holding the constitutional post of governor. Since the trial is being conducted on day-to-day basis, the CBI application may be taken up on September 11. Moving the application, the CBI pleaded that Kalyan Singh was charge-sheeted in 1993. It further pleaded that the Supreme Court in its order of April 19, 2017, had said that Kalyan, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992, could not be brought in as an accused to face trial in view of the constitutional immunity granted to governors under Article 361 of the Constitution. The SC had, however, allowed the CBI to move for summoning Kalyan as an accused as soon as he ceased to be the governor. All the accused persons are on bail in the case, being conducted on day-to-day basis, owing to the SC direction issued on April 19, 2017. The CBI had filed charge-sheet against the accused persons, including Kalyan Singh, in 1993. Kalyan Singh was appointed as governor on September 3, 2014, for a term of five years, which is now complete. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Suicide seal on death of IAS officer’s wife,"LUCKNOW : Based on postmortem examination, report from the forensic science laboratory and statements of family members, Lucknow police have come to the conclusion that Anita Singh, wife of State Urban Development Authority (SUDA) director Umesh Pratap Singh, committed suicide. The 42-year-old woman, found with a gunshot wound on the sofa of her room at their Vikalp Khand house in Gomtinagar on September 1, was declared brought dead in hospital. Her IAS officer husband said she was on medication for depression and had used her own licensed pistol to kill herself. Anita’s cousin and advocate Rajeev Kumar Singh, however, lodged a murder FIR at Chinhat police station on September 5 against her husband who he accused of extramarital affairs. SP (North) Sukirti Madhav Mishra told TOI that they were ruling out foul play. He said the statements of the IAS officer, his son Ashutosh and domestic helps, Tulsiram and Vikas, who were present at the time of the incident, were found to be consistent. “Also, the FSL team that reconstructed the scene found the door was locked from inside and had to be broken open,” Mishra said. The SP insisted that the autopsy report also indicated suicide. “The postmortem shows her entry wound is large than the exit wound, which is possible in a contact shot,” he said, adding that gunshot residue was not found on the husband. “Hence, in the absence of doubts, the murder charge stands dismissed.” "
Lucknow,Sunni kinnar makes tazia for Hindu friend,"LUCKNOW: Twenty-eight years ago, Choti Rani Kinnar — a Sunni Muslim and transgender woman — had pledged to keep a tazia (replica of Imam Husain’s mausoleum in Iraq) for her ailing Hindu friend and observe mourning of the Imam’s martyrdom during Muharram if her friend was cured. That was 1991. Choti Rani Kinnar has sat by her paper tazia in Hazratganj fulfilling the promise and attracting Muslims, non-Muslims and the transgender community to her sacred spot every Muharram since. “My friend, Srawan, was down with cholera that year. One day when his condition was critical, we rushed him to hospital. On the way, we crossed a tazia procession. I prayed to Allah that my friend be cured by evening. If my wish was granted, I promised to observe Muharram mourning,” said Choti Rani whose real name is Ghiasuddin. A resident of Charbagh, the 40-year-old kinnar has been keeping a tazia from the seventh day of Muharram, which is then buried at Nishatganj cemetery on Ashoora (the 10th day). “An elaborate mehendi procession taken out on the seventh Muharram accompanies the tazia from Charbagh to Hazratganj. And the next three nights I spend here with the tazia. A lot of people come here for mourning and for wish fulfilment,” she said. The spot chosen by Choti Rani is where on the rest of the days her fruit juice shop runs. “The tazia has not just fulfilled my vow for my friend, but has been miraculous for others too. A number of women since then have claimed they bore a child after they prayed here,” she said. “Many return on the ninth day and weigh their wishful children on a huge iron scale, against dry fruits and fruits, which are then distributed to the poor,” Choti Rani added. And that is not all. The devout transgender also holds a vegetarian langar on the seventh and ninth Muharram, honouring sentiments of the many Hindus who come to pay their tribute to the Imam. “Kheer, pulao with nutri nuggets, tea and puri-sabzi are served to people in Imam Husain’s name,” she said.

Ghaziabad,"Pay share for smart traffic system, GDA asks civic body","GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has demanded Rs 10 crore from the municipal corporation for implementing the integrated traffic management system (ITMS) across the district. In all, Rs 78.3 crore would be spent on the project and its maintenance in the next five years, officials said. GDA vice-chairman Kanchan Verma said a letter was sent to the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) a couple of days ago asking the civic body to pay up its share for the project. Asked about the recent development, GMC commissioner Dinesh Chandra said: “We have received the letter. We will have to seek funds from the state government, as there is no allocation for this purpose under the smart city project.”  The work on ITMS will start from this month itself and the GDA has finalised a private firm for this purpose, officials said.  Altogether, three companies were in the fray and after analysing their technical and financial proposals, the GDA had finalised the one firm in July this year. Earlier, the company had quoted Rs 84 crore, including maintenance for five years. A command system had been planned on a 2,000 sqm-plot at Meerut tri-section to monitor traffic. But now, a police training workshop is being run from the spot. Verma said a spot inspection would be conducted. In case the workshop is being run from that place, the police would be asked to provide an alternative space for it, she added. The command centre will have LED monitors to keep real time tabs on traffic movement across the city. Under the ITMS, as many as 110 pan tilt zoom (PTZ) cameras and 300 red light vehicle detection (RLVD) cameras, public address system at 82 places, speed violation cameras at three places and at 15 stretches, number plate recognition (NPR) cameras would be installed in several places across the city. The system was mooted in view of constant jams and tailbacks of vehicles reported from various stretches of roads across the city. It will help in real-time monitoring of movement and congestion of vehicles as well as violation of traffic rules. Speed violation cameras would be installed at three stretches — Hindon Elevated Road, UP Gate and Atmaram Steel roundabout, which are known for vehicles travelling in high speed. "
Ghaziabad,"‘Auto gang’ busted, 3 arrested from Sahibabad","GHAZIABAD: Police on Sunday arrested three people who are allegedly part of an ‘auto gang’ that robbed a woman before pushing her out of a vehicle on Saturday. The trio was arrested from Sahibabad. The men have been identified as Pappan, Kuldeep and Sonu Kashyap, police said.The modus operandi of the gang is to lure passengers into auto rickshaws, threaten them at gunpoint, and rob them of cash and other valuables. The victim is usually dumped by the roadside. Shlok Kumar, SP (city) said, “We received a tip-off that the men are residents of Sahibabad. The cops nabbed them when they were returning home.” Police said a woman in Sahibabad’s Arthala area runs a gang with over 20 members. She has 10 auto-rickshaws, which she gives to the gang members for robberies. She takes 60 percent of the valuables while the rest is divided. ""The men told us the woman had hired them on a monthly salary along with a share in the loot,” Kumar said. The police are trying to nab the accused woman. "
Ghaziabad,"Man poses as Agra ADM to get work done, held in Ghaziabad","GHAZIABAD: For months, Pawan Kumar Pandey got the slow wheels of bureaucracy moving with a “push” – pretending to be an additional district magistrate and, just in case it did not inspire the required urgency, also the district magistrate’s brother. On Sunday, his luck ran out. Pawan, 42, had moved to Delhi from Prayagraj a few years ago and had been working with a private organisation. About eight months ago, he left his job. Unemployed since, he decided to put his new-found time to “productive” use. “Pawan would visit government offices, announce that he was an additional district magistrate from Agra and the Ghaziabad district magistrate’s brother. He would throw his weight around and demand that his work be prioritised,” Shlok Kumar, SP (City), told TOI. Besides a predictable culture of subservience, the claim also worked well because he shared his surname with the district magistrate, Ajay Shankar Pandey. But only for six months. “Recently, Pawan called up a few officers in the Ghaziabad administration and did his routine. This time, an official followed it up with the district magistrate. His game was up,” Kumar added. “Police put his number on surveillance and traced him to Delhi with occasional visits to Ghaziabad,” the SP said. On Sunday night, he was arrested by a team of Sahibabad Police and Ghaziabad administration officials. The investigation now involves Delhi Police and Ghaziabad Police. An FIR has been filed against him under IPC sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 170 (impersonating a public servant), 189 (threat of injury to public servant), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). Pawan was sent to jail after being produced in court on Monday. He insists it was not a heist – he did everything with a clear conscience. “I never took money and only did it a few times. Government officials always harass people when any work needs to be done. I was just helping my friends and family,” he told TOI. "
Lucknow,"Vasundhara, Siddhartha Vihar property rates hiked","GHAZIABAD: The Uttar Pradesh Housing Board has increased sector rates in its areas and the revised prices have come into effect retrospectively from September 1, officials said. Its board that met in Lucknow on September 5 has decided to increase the rates by 16% for properties in Vasundhara and Siddhartha Vihar. “In August, we had proposed a 16% hike in sector rates and that has been vetted by the board of the UP Housing Board,” said an official at the UP Housing Board. “On the basis of the prevailing market rates and other factors, we had proposed a hike in sector rates, which the board has agreed to,” the official added. According to the revised rates, in the even sectors of Vasundhara, the rate is now Rs 65,800/sqm. Earlier, it was Rs 56,700/sqm. In the odd sectors of Vasundhara, the revised rates are Rs 59,400/sqm. It was Rs 51,200/sqm in the last fiscal. There are 19 sectors in Vasundhara. The increased sectors rates will also have a bearing on group housing societies and commercial establishments. “As a rule, sector rates in group housing societies is 1.5 times the residential rates and it has been hiked in the same ratio in Vasundhara,” the official said. The sector rates of commercial properties are twice the residential rates. Siddhartha Vihar is another area administered by the UP Housing Board and here, the hiked circle rate is Rs 55,600/sqm, up from Rs 43,800/sqm that was last year. The rates in Ganga, Yamuna and Hindon housing schemes in Sidharth Vihar have also been hiked in the same ratio. “In Ganga, Yamuna and Hindon Housing Scheme, the sector rate last year was Rs 37,700/sqm.

In five years, around 3 lakh 30,000 people are expected to occupy the flats that are being constructed in different private group housing schemes. The hiked sector rate is going to affect the prospective buyers at a time the real estate sector is going through a slump. An official said: “The rates have been hiked in Siddhartha Vihar to incorporate Ganga Jal water charges that the township will be getting because of proximity to Pratap Vihar Ganga Jal water treatment plant.” There is a proposal to provide 12.5 cusecs of Ganga water to Siddhartha Vihar, said another official.

Lucknow,UP: Kalyan Singh dares Opposition to clarify stand on Ram Mandir issue,"LUCKNOW: Soon after rejoining BJP on Monday, former UP chief minister, Kalyan Singh, under whose regime Babri Masjid was razed in 1992, threw a challenge to Opposition parties, asking them to clarify their stand on Ram temple, saying the issue involves the faith of crores of Hindus for whom Ayodhya is sacred. “I don’t want to do politics but the Opposition needs to clarify its stand on the issue,” said Kalyan, who completed his term as Rajasthan governor recently. Earlier, Kalyan was accorded a grand welcome on reaching BJP headquarters in Lucknow. He joined the party in presence of UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, and was accompanied by his son, Rajveer Singh, who is MP from Etah. Speaking to reporters at his Mall Avenue residence which was dotted with posters hailing him as ‘Ramjanmabhoomi Ke Nayak...Hindu Hriday Samrat’, Kalyan said he hasn’t ‘retired’ yet. “For me, politics is a means to serve the people,” he said, while clarifying that he would not contest elections. “I did not speak much in last five years during my term as governor, but am happy to see BJP grow as the biggest party in world,” he added. “There is no alternative to BJP now, both at Centre and in state. This further increases the responsibilities of party workers. As a worker, I would try my best to take the party forward,” he said. Targeting opposition, Singh said SP, BSP and Congress would never be able to make a comeback as they have lost their ‘janaadhar’ (public support), while BJP has managed to touch every section of society. Hailing the Yogi Adityanath government, he said UP has witnessed a lot of change since BJP came to power. “The law and order situation has improved and there has not been a single communal riot,” he said. Considered a fire-brand Hindutva and OBC leader, Kalyan took BJP to new heights during Ram temple movement of early 90s. Kalyan, who comes from Lodh community, however, clarified that his credentials should not be a challenge to OBC leaders. “Main yahan pratiyogi nahi, sahbhagi banne aaya hoon (I am not here as competitor but as an associate,’’ he said.

Lucknow,"Two cops shot at in Hardoi, former armyman arrested","LUCKNOW: Two police constables suffered gunshot injuries after three men opened fire on them at a petrol pump in Karchauna area of Hardoi on Monday evening. Cops nabbed one of the attackers, an ex-armyman, while efforts are on to nab two others. One of the injured constables, Kaushlendra Singh, is undergoing treatment at the district hospital while the other, Mahipal Singh, was discharged after primary treatment. According to police, a call was received at the control room at around 5.30pm that a car owner and his two aides were threatening to open fire at a petrol station following a dispute. The two constables reached the spot and knocked at the door of the car at which one of the occupants opened indiscriminate fire injuring Kaushlendra and Mahipal. The cops called up the control room for reinforcement. Superintendent of police, Hardoi, Alok Priyadarshi said: “Mahipal followed the culprits when they tried to flee. Both the sides exchanged fire. A police team intercepted the car on Lucknow-Hardoi highway.” “The three men tried to run away leaving the car behind but the cops overpowered one of them, identified as Sandeep Singh, who had also suffered a gunshot injury. He is undergoing treatment at the hospital and his statement will be recorded once he regains consciousness,” he added. The SP said when the credential of Sandeep were checked, it was found that he was an ex-armyman. "
Lucknow,"Principal, teacher booked after class 6 student’s death in Hardoi","LUCKNOW: The principal and the class teacher of a boarding school in Hardoi were booked for alleged negligence after a class 6 student died under mysterious circumstances on Sunday, police said. The student’s family and relatives staged a protest against the school authorities and called off the agitation on the assurance of senior police officers. The post-mortem examination report of the child is awaited. According to police, Shobhit of class VI complained of trouble in breathing around 1 pm on Sunday after which the teachers took him to a nearby community health centre in Sandi. The doctors, however, refused to admit Shobhit and referred him to a private hospital. Superintendent of police, Hardoi, Alok Priyadarshi said Shobhit was shifted to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival. He said the body was sent for autopsy as no external injuries were found on the victim’s body. “Doctors have told us that the child might have some problem in the windpipe leading to choking. The exact cause of death will be ascertained when we received the autopsy report,” the SP added. Shobhit’s father Rakesh told TOI that he suspected foul play in the death of his son. “My child was not taken to a proper hospital. His life could have been saved,” he said, alleging that his son had injury marks on his body. The victim’s uncle told mediaperosns that he was not only good in studies but also sports. He had represented the school in junior hockey tournaments. “ I suspect a conspiracy behind his death or a possibility of stale food being served could not be ruled out either,” he said. "
Lucknow,Happy Fridge: Leftovers to feed hungry mouths in Aliganj,"LUCKNOW: The next time you feel remorse over having to throw away leftover food, don’t punish yourself with a guilt trip. Instead go keep it in the ‘Happy Fridge’—a community refrigerator installed by a bunch of good Samaritans near Puraniya Crossing in Aliganj to ensure no one sleeps on an hungry stomach. The one-a-kind refrigerator is the brainchild of Hunger Heroes, a citizen-driven initiative led by Abhishek Shukla and his team of five. People can come forward to keep leftovers in the fridge, which would later be used by the Hunger Heroes to feed the hungry. “We want to encourage people to not throw away food and instead give it to us. For example, if a family purchases 10 bottles of fruit juice and is left with five, they can leave them in the Happy Fridge. The juice might be of use to someone less fortunate. It would bridge the gap between the hungry and those with leftover food,” said Shukla. Shukla and his team started the community fridge after being inspired by a similar initiative launched by another NGO Feed India. The New Delhi-based organisation has set up over 500 such community fridges in more than 100 cities. The food repository will be open 24x7 and food from the 300-litre capacity fridge will be able to feed 70-100 people every day. The organisation mandates that residents store only packed vegetarian food and liquids in the fridge. “The food stored in the refrigerator will be good for at least 12-14 hours. People are free to come and deposit their eatables in the fridge or request us to pick it up by contacting us on the Feed India helpline. The Hunger Heroes will collect the leftovers and deposit it in the Happy Fridge,” the 44-year-old added. He also said that someone from his team would be manning the refrigerator at all hours of the day. “If the pilot project is successful, we’ll install around 10 more Happy Fridges in different localities of the city,” he added.

Lucknow,UP: How app cabs take gullible riders for a ride,"LUCKNOW: App cab drivers cancelling confirmed rides or launching the journey without reaching pick-up point, which leads to the rider incurring charges, should be penalised on the basis of the total fare, daily commuters in UP recently said in a survey. Among 51,000 people questioned by social media and citizen engagement platform Local Circles in the country, 21% belonging to UP cities like Lucknow, Varanasi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut demanded that the surge pricing be capped at 25% and preferred a fixed penalty of Rs 100 if a driver cancelled a confirmed ride. “When I interacted with a number of users, many active app cab users complained that drivers cancel rides after asking for the destination and mode of payment. Surge pricing that kicks in when cabs are in high demand, like during monsoon or heavy traffic, was also a common concern,” said Sachin Taparia, founder and chairman of Local Circles. With 2,000-plus app cabs plying in Lucknow, TOI spoke to those caught in similar predicaments. “I use the app cab service because it is convenient and cheaper than a car on rent. But, if the weather is inclement or it is peak hours, surge pricing kicks in. Often, the fare increases manifold at the end of a ride. Taking advantage of a ride in times of need is fleecing,” said Bhoomika Kalwani, a student of Lucknow University.

Ghaziabad,UP: How app cabs take gullible riders for a ride,"LUCKNOW: App cab drivers cancelling confirmed rides or launching the journey without reaching pick-up point, which leads to the rider incurring charges, should be penalised on the basis of the total fare, daily commuters in UP recently said in a survey. Among 51,000 people questioned by social media and citizen engagement platform Local Circles in the country, 21% belonging to UP cities like Lucknow, Varanasi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut demanded that the surge pricing be capped at 25% and preferred a fixed penalty of Rs 100 if a driver cancelled a confirmed ride. “When I interacted with a number of users, many active app cab users complained that drivers cancel rides after asking for the destination and mode of payment. Surge pricing that kicks in when cabs are in high demand, like during monsoon or heavy traffic, was also a common concern,” said Sachin Taparia, founder and chairman of Local Circles. With 2,000-plus app cabs plying in Lucknow, TOI spoke to those caught in similar predicaments. “I use the app cab service because it is convenient and cheaper than a car on rent. But, if the weather is inclement or it is peak hours, surge pricing kicks in. Often, the fare increases manifold at the end of a ride. Taking advantage of a ride in times of need is fleecing,” said Bhoomika Kalwani, a student of Lucknow University. Shivani Patil, a businesswoman, said she often faced ride cancellation. “A fortnight ago, the driver cancelled my ride from Hazratganj to Chowk after he called and asked my destination.

Lucknow,SC to study if under-18 Muslim girl can marry on attaining puberty,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court’s   2018 judgment   on the marriage of Hadiya nee Akhila and Safin Jahan, which recognised attaining of puberty as a condition for a valid Muslim marriage, has resulted in an unintended legal complexity — a 16-year-old Muslim girl has now petitioned the apex court to validate her marriage saying she has attained puberty. In India, the legal age of marriage is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys, both under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. But the court in the   Shafin Jahan case   recognised that a Muslim marriage was valid if the following conditions were met: Both individuals professed Islam; both were of the age of puberty; if there was an offer and acceptance in the presence of two witnesses; giving of ‘mehr’; and absence of a prohibited degree of relationship. Citing the SC’s 2018 judgment in Shafin Jahan vs Asokan K M, the 16-year-old Muslim girl moved the court through advocate Dushyant Parashar, challenging the Allahabad HC’s decision to send her to a women’s shelter home terming the marriage invalid because she was not of legal marriageable age. A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Indira Banerjee and Ajay Rastogi entertained the petition and issued notice to the UP government and sought its response in two weeks. Parashar told the SC that examining the facts of the case on the touchstone of the Shafin Jahan judgment, it would be a valid marriage as both the 16-year-old girl and her 24-year-old husband professed Islam, attained puberty, there was offer and acceptance, giving and taking of ‘mehr’ and a nikahnama was drawn with the consent of the girl and the boy. The girl’s father had lodged a police complaint alleging that the man had kidnapped his minor daughter. But the girl recorded her statement under Section 164 of Criminal Procedure Code before a magistrate and said she married the man of her own volition without any pressure and that she wanted to live with him. But a court in Bahraich, UP, on June 24 took note that the girl had not reached the age of marriage and directed her to be lodged in the custody of the Child Welfare Committee, Bahraich, till she attained the age of majority, that is 18 years. The girl’s husband moved a habeas corpus petition before the Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC, which dismissed the petition and said under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, she would be treated as a minor and hence the marriage was void. The HC agreed with the lower court’s decision to send her to a women’s shelter home. Advocate Parashar cited the Shafin Jahan judgment in which the SC had said that right to choose a life partner was a constitutionally guaranteed right. He said the girl’s father was interfering with her right to live with her life partner, whom she had chosen after attaining puberty and married through a valid nikahnama. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Free treatment for kids with malnutrition in private hospitals,"GHAZIABAD: From now, children below two years of age and suffering from acute malnutrition (red category) will not only be provided with free treatment by private hospitals but also be given a balanced diet till they become medically fit. The district has 2,425 children in the red category and district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said the administration is planning to connect such children with private hospitals in each block, apart from the government clinic. A Kaushambi-based private hospital has announced the adoption of 500 children who would be given free treatment and food, the DM added. Of the 2,425 children, 250 have been traced to Rajapur block, 263 in Bhojpur, 186 in Muradnagar and 257 in Loni. According to the State Nutrition Mission, infants who weigh less than 2.5 kg at the time of birth are classified in the red category. They are to be kept under regular check-ups and their weight is monitored every month. The government also provides them with sweet/salty porridge and other food items. When the weight goes above 2.5 kg, the child is put in the yellow category. At two years, if a child weighs around 5 kg, it is considered in the general category.  “Private hospitals will adopt children and provide them with medical care and nutritional food free of cost. We will treat these children as ‘VVIPs’. We are talking to private hospitals. So far, Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi, has given its nod,” Pandey told TOI. “We are trying to ensure that no child remains in the red category by the end of this month.” A meeting of private hospitals and administrative officials will be convened on Thursday to discuss the initiative.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: This Navratri, feasts only in steel utensils","GHAZIABAD: This time during Navratri and Durga Puja, event organisers will have to serve food to their guests only in steel utensils. The order was issued after a directive came from the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) that also prepared a standard operating procedure (SOP) with an aim to start a “Bartan Bank” or utensil bank for such festivities. The move comes at a time the district administration has banned the use of plastic cups and plates at official meetings. The SOP related to the utensil bank has been sent to the state government for consideration. GMC commissioner Dinesh Chandra said: “The concept of ‘bartan banks’ was introduced during kanwar yatra in Ghaziabad this year. Plastic cups and plates were completely banned at camps across the entire district. The new order will be implemented during Navrarti and those who not follow would be fined. We are taking help of civil defence and religious and social organisations to create the banks and interested parties can take utensils from there at a nominal rate.” Chandra added that the civic body has also developed bartan banks in each of its five zones. “We will provide steel utensils to small organisers at a cost of Re 1 per plate and bowl and Re 0.50 per spoon. A refundable security deposit will also be charged,” Chandra said, adding that Ghaziabad is the probably first city in the country to have such an initiative. During Kanwar Yatra, the GMC took help of social and religious organisations for creating such banks. The civic body had also organise workshops to spread awareness regarding using steel utensils and avoiding plastic. Around 20 lakh devotees consumed food at various camps across the district. But the civic body was able to reduce waste generation significantly during that period, Chandra said. The district administration has banned the use of plastic and thermocol cups, plates and glasses at official meetings. Only steel and glass utensils are allowed. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said a directive banning plastic utensils during Navratri will be issued soon. Events organisers have welcomed the decision.

Lucknow,"Now, primary textbooks in Awadhi, Bhojpuri in Uttar Pradesh","LUCKNOW: To improve the grasping ability of children in UP, the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) is all set to introduce textbooks in local dialects, including Bhojpuri and Awadhi. The move, officials said, will achieve twin objectives. One, it will give due importance to colloquial tongues, thereby helping in their preservation. Two, it will “increase the learning outcome” in children using language as a medium. As a pilot project, the textbooks — released by basic education minister Satish Dwivedi at a review meeting on Wednesday — will be introduced “in a day or two” in classes I and II in Mathura, Gorakhpur, Lalitpur and Barabanki districts. They have been drafted in four dialects — Braj, Bhojpuri, Bundelkhandi and Awadhi. “The idea is to help students learn lessons in a language that is easy for them to understand. We have got 15 books printed in each language. In each of the four districts, 10 schools have been identified where these will be introduced,” said Ajay Singh, joint director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, who is spearheading the project. Officials explained that in UP, teachers from one region (say Meerut) are posted in another region (say Gorakhpur). So, they are often unable to reach out to students. “To break the language barrier, we have transformed books from standard Hindi to local dialects. The content remains unchanged,” Singh said. The books also have a special feature to help in teaching. Teachers who are not at home with the local dialect can scan a QR code for each lesson. This allows them to play an audio of the lesson for students who can listen and understand. Class I children in primary schools in UP have one textbook, called Colorav. It has three sections — English, Hindi and mathematics. In Class II, there are two textbooks, one for Hindi and English (also called Colorav), and the other for mathematics. The new textbooks in local dialects are being given the name ‘Sahaj’. Officials said only the Hindi sections in the books had been translated. "
Lucknow,"In UP, adopt 4 stray cattle, earn up to Rs 3,600 per month","LUCKNOW: The state government has given the marketing term ‘cash cow’ a literal spin to tackle the stray cattle problem. A scheme, rolled out last month and implemented in Lucknow district two days ago, is allowing people living in semi-urban and rural areas to adopt up to four stray cows, bulls and calves in any permutation and combination, and earn up to Rs 3,600 a month. The response is overwhelming with the Lucknow administration receiving 1,500 applications by Wednesday evening. The Nirashrit/Besahara Govansh Sahbhagita Yojana was introduced on August 8 for management of stray cattle with public support. Under the scheme, a foster parent is paid Rs 30 per day per animal as maintenance. Lucknow issued an execution order on September 9 for adoption of animals caught within city limits by LMC and on the outskirts by authorities of all the eight development blocks and eight nagar panchayats. Everyone has been given a target for promoting adoption. The animals are being ear-tagged for easy identification if abandoned after adoption. Of the 24,940 animals caught so far in the district, 9,079 have been ear-tagged and are available for adoption. Over 4,400 are available with LMC, followed by 895 in Mohanlalganj, 833 in Maal and 789 in Malihabad blocks. “We have received 1,500 adoption applications, mostly from farmers and landless daily wage earners. The scheme will add to their income and will help control stray cattle, responsible for damaging crops in villages and causing accidents in city,” said chief veterinary officer Tej Singh Yadav. “The process of verification is underway and we will hand over the animals to deserving applicants in 15 days,” he added. The state veterinary department will also conduct regular inspection of foster homes. If an animal is sick, the owner will have to inform the department, which will arrange for free treatment. “However, in case of death, a postmortem will be done to ascertain the cause and action will be taken if there is foul play,” said LMC director (animal welfare) Arvind Rao. On the buzz that Rs 30 a day for upkeep was paltry, officials said swathes of non-crop fields on the outskirts of the city would allow foster homes to easily feed the adopted animal. The money can be saved. It will be an additional source of income for poor families, they said. "

Lucknow,"UP caught in vicious stress-social media cycle, shows KGMU survey","LUCKNOW: One in every 10 individuals in Uttar Pradesh is stuck in the vicious cycle of stress management and social media usage. It means these individuals spend more than three hours a day browsing the internet beyond professional need, hoping to buffer stress, but end up feeling more anxious about and dissatisfied with their daily life. The stress survey on 12,000 respondents conducted by KGMU’s departments of psychiatry and community medicine, with support from UP Health Strengthening System Project, has also found that the average tobacco consumption has jumped by 10% since 2017, adversely affecting mental health. Recommendations to reverse the conditions will be offered to the state government on Thursday. Conducted in Muzaffarnagar, Jhansi, Maharajganj and Lakhimpur Kheri districts over a period of three months from December 2018, the survey — titled Perceived Stress and Coping in Community Representative Population of Uttar Pradesh — included people in the age group of 13-75 years. “The most common reason for use of internet is social media, which we found to be 93%. We found that one in every 10 persons in UP indulged in excessive use of gadgets — more than three hours a day — for non-professional purpose. Nearly one-sixth of these internet users qualified for social media disorder,” said Dr Sujit Kar of KGMU’s psychiatry department. Head of psychiatry professor PK Dalal and Dr SK Singh of community medicine were also part of the research team. “It was observed that when people experienced stress, their internet use went up. Although they did so to combat stress, it only added to dissatisfaction, which in turn enhanced their stress. So, it became a vicious cycle,” explained Dr Kar. Interestingly, the survey found that satisfaction related to daily activities was seen among people who were educated, unmarried and in the high-income group. High substance abuse in UP also crossed its previous average of 16% to leap to 27.6%. Tobacco smoking has been recorded at 10.6%, alcohol consumption at 10.3% , cannabis intake at 0.6% and opium intake at 0.1%. Another major finding of the survey showed that more than 90% of the people experienced stress in the past year due to poverty and financial difficulties and only one-fourth of those surveyed knew about healthcare facilities for management of stress and related disorders.

Lucknow,UP government seeks options for milk in midday meal,"LUCKNOW: The Mid Day Meal Authority in Uttar Pradesh has directed all education officials to suggest the best available alternatives for milk in districts which are facing problems in supply or quality of the nutrient-rich liquid food. The move came after frequent inspections revealed problems of milk availability and supply, maintenance and distribution. In a letter to all basic shiksha adhikaris in the state, UP MDM Authority director Vijay Kiran Anand said it was noticed during inspections that milk has to be served with ‘tehri’ every Wednesday as per menu, but problems of availability, maintenance and distribution were seen at schools. The director asked basic shiksha adhikaris to seriously think of the best available options and send suggestions wherever quality milk is not available. It also suggested seven food items, including fruits, jaggery-gram, halwa, glucose biscuit packets, cheese or curd and kheer among the probable alternatives to milk. Anand told TOI, “We have received suggestions from several districts for improving supply chain and are taking action. We are also in the process of coordinating with UP Pradeshik Cooperative Dairy Federation (UPPCDF). We are also discussing options that have been suggested.” As per norms, 25 litre of milk has to be supplied for every 100 students in schools. Milk was being supplied in 1.58 lakh primary schools for students studying in classes 1 to 5 and 45,590 of upper primary schools studying in classes 6 to 8. Around 1.58 crore students are enrolled in government and aided schools across the state. "

A special 48-hour, non-stop session of the Assembly was planned on the initiation of chief minister Yogi Adityanath to discuss and deliberate the 17-point charter of the United Nations’ Agenda on Development in the state. The decision was finalised at an all-party meeting called by Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit and attended by the chief minister, leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, Ajay Kumar of the Congress and Lalji Verma of BSP. At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, it was decided that the special session will called from October 1 and should be on the occasion of the national celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary year of Mahatma Gandhi.

Instead of day and night deliberations, the session could have been extended to three or four days. SP is preoccupied with agitations and a final decision would be taken soon,’ said Chaudhary. “What is the need for a non-stop session. Is it an Emergency?” said a Congress MLA, adding that the final decision to attend it will be taken soon. "
Lucknow,"Goverment approves interim relief for mob violence, lynching","LUCKNOW: The victims of mob violence and lynching will now be entitled to 25% of the total monetary compensation as interim relief, pending an inquiry into the matter. The decision was taken by the state cabinet headed by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday. UP government spokesperson and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said compensation is given to mob violence victims or kin of those lynched only after completion of probe, but now they will be given 25% of total compensation amount as interim relief while investigations are on. “The amount will be given on the report of district magistrate under whose jurisdiction the incident occurs,” he said. In case, a mob violence victim succumbs, full compensation will be given to family members. The decision to provide compensation and interim relief to victims comes in the wake of Supreme Court order on the petition filed by Tehseen S Poonawala. The apex court in its order dated July 17, 2018 had said that state governments should give due regard to the nature of bodily and psychological injuries and loss of earning, including loss of opportunity of employment, education and expenses incurred on account of legal and medical expenses. The apex court further said that the interim relief be paid to the victim/next of kin within 30 days of the incident. The compensatory provision was mandatory under UP compensation scheme of 2014, amended in 2016, under section 357-A of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, there was no provision of providing an interim relief. The provision has now been added, said Singh. Several cases of mob lynching were lodged in Bihar, UP, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala in recent years. Some state governments have taken initiative to enact specific laws to counter lynching. "
Lucknow,Transformer snag in rain? Get ready to pay for repairs,"LUCKNOW: If the power transformer in your housing society or apartment complex breaks down, be ready to pay for the repairs or replacement. The Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (MVVNL) has decided to charge end users for transformer snags for which Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (Lesa) is not directly responsible. Notices to this effect are being sent to all the 450 housing societies and apartments, having a total population of over 2.1 lakh. MVVNL officials said if a transformer breaks down due to erratic voltage or tripping/overloading, the power corporation will be responsible for repairs or replacement. However, if the cause of breakdown is natural like rainfall or man-made like tampering, a fee will be charged. Chief engineer of MVVNL Ashok Kumar said the decision was taken following complaints of deliberate damage to transformers. “In the past three months, there were 113 such cases. Every time, we repaired the transformer. The cost varied from Rs 3,000 to Rs 70,000. The new rule will make developers and residents more responsible and alert,” Kumar said. In its notice, the MVVNL has stated that the builder or caretaker will be responsible for the upkeep of transformer/s. The right has been transferred to housing societies or apartments, and they will have to pay the amount for maintenance or replacement. Housing societies have opposed the move and are planning to petition the government through the integrated grievance redress cell. President of a society in Jankipuram Anand Shukla said, “If we pay for maintaining, what will LESA do? Will it only transmit electricity from substations to transformers?” "
Lucknow,Lucknow: ASI stamp on antiques to check smuggling,"LUCKNOW: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will invite Lucknow residents to get antiques they might own registered with it during its ‘Antiquity Campaign’.

Hence, we decided to do away with offline counter booking and provide only online option for Tejas.” He said the train would be operated by private players and full ticket price would be charged from all passengers, including senior citizens and children. “Every passenger will have travel insurance cover worth Rs 25 lakh. Further, advance reservation days will be 60 days for Tejas as compared to 120 days for prominent trains,” the IRCTC CMD said. He said no deductions would be made if a passenger cancels a waiting list ticket before the train’s departure. “Only Rs 25 will be deducted if confirmed ticket is cancelled as compared to deduction of Rs 65 in other trains. Current booking will be available for users after preparation of first chart, which is generally four hours before the departure of train,” Mall said. "
Lucknow,Enforcement Directorate to question 10 lease holders in mining scam,"LUCKNOW: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued notices to 10 mining permit holders for illegal mining in Hamirpur district. The notices were issued after ED registered a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case against IAS officer, B. Chandrakala, and 10 others on January 17, this year. While probing the multi-crore mining scam, ED has come across evidence that suggests that the 10 mining lease holders, in connivance with district authorities and mining officials, conducted mining in area several times more than leased, their leases were renewed and permits granted without following the e-tendering procedure as laid down by the Allahabad high court in its order. ED officials said the illegalities went on from 2012 to 2016, causing huge loss to the state exchequer. An official disclosed that the 10 lease holders had as many as 70 leases and were also named by central bureau of investigation (CBI) in its FIR. Earlier, ED had questioned then Hamirpur DM, B Chandrakala, and questioned her for allotting fresh leases without following e-tendering procedures and illegal excavation of minerals. ""A notice has been issued to the lease holders and they have been summoned. Their properties will be confiscated if their answers are not found convincing,"" said an official. ED is also probing mining scam in Deoria, Fatehpur, Shamli and Kaushambi. A public interest litigation (PIL) had blown the lid off the mining scam on July 28, 2016, when the Allahabad high court directed CBI to investigate the anomalies. "
Lucknow,"UP banks on GPS, RFID tags to curb liquor smuggling","LUCKNOW: In order to curb liquor smuggling menace, UP government has decided to equip vehicles transporting liquor with global positioning system (GPS) devices and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. The decision, cleared by the state cabinet on Tuesday, comes days after a spate of hooch tragedies in the state. According to the cabinet note, the state government has given its nod to the UP excise (liquor and power alcohol) rules in consonance with Centre’s directives. Under the arrangement, the movement of vehicles transporting liquor and ethanol-blended alcohol can be tracked with GPS and RFID. Besides this, the system of providing permits for alcohol and ethanol movement will be replaced by online report as per the directives of the Centre. This would not only smoothen the alcohol transportation but also check mixing of ethanol in it. Officials said that the system will help the administration in keeping a close watch on alcohol transportation. Transporters will not be allowed to open the containers at any point of time in travel, will have to compulsorily follow the approved route and any violation would invite penalty under excise rules. Officials said that the provision will help in checking liquor smuggling from bordering states and curb sale of illicit liquor. The provisions will ensure that petroleum companies get adequate ethanol in time, officials said. The cabinet also cleared the proposal to reimburse the SGST levied on sale of tickets of the film ‘Super 30’ after having declared the Hrithik Roshan-starrer taxfree in the state. "
Lucknow,Onam brings Kerala to Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: With the advent of the harvest period in Kerala, people of the Malayali community residing in the city brought Kerala alive in their homes and greeted each other with smiling faces on Wednesday morning on the occasion of Onam. While women were dressed in the traditional attire of white and gold 'kasavu' saris, men wore the 'mundu' and welcomed the festival by decorating their houses with beautiful pookalam (flower rangoli) in their courtyards, onavillu (music), followed by the authentic 27-course 'onasadya' meal served on banana leaves. Preparations for all festivities had begun in advance in many homes. Malayali cultural associations in the city have been active already, holding various cultural programmes and traditional feasts. ""The attempt was not just to bring together members of our community, but also to showcase the culture of our state to Lucknow,"" said Suresh VK, the member of the 60-year-old Kerala Samajam. ""Onam has changed over the years but there is something unchanged about it-it celebrates the value of togetherness, which is essential to our culture,"" said Sindhu Nair (37), a resident of LDA Colony. The festival is celebrated to welcome the return of Mahabali, a revered king in the mystic legends, popular in God's own country, Kerala.

Ghaziabad,Challan fear: Server crashes amid rush for driving licence,"NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: The rush for driving licences in Noida and Ghaziabad because of fear of high penalties for traffic violations has got officials wondering how many people were actually driving till now without a valid document. The rush is so huge that on Wednesday, the server crashed across UP leading to long queues and commotion. In Noida, the transport department usually gives time slots for 100 DLs in a day. So while one could get an appointment within a day or two earlier, for the past week, DL application slots are booked for over 15 days ahead. In Ghaziabad, the wait is a little longer, with over 15,000 DL applications pending. “There is much confusion about the new penalties among people and they are trying to get all paperwork and records in line,” said Himesh Tiwary, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO) . There are also various kinds of queries the transport department officials get throughout the day. For instance, people penalised in Delhi come to Noida to check if the fine can be reduced. “Some people also want to know if the waiting time can be reduced as they don’t have the required DL,” he added. For many, the quest for a new DL is simply because the older one got lost or misplaced — which didn’t bother the driver earlier but has now translated into a substantial worry. For others, it’s the first time they are applying for a DL even though they have been driving for some time now. One such gentleman is Amit Kumar, who was visiting the Noida RTO for a DL on Wednesday. “I applied for a license on Wednesday and have been given a time slot on October 3 for verification of documents and final formalities. Till then I’ll have to be careful while driving, especially to Delhi,” he said. Balbir Singh, a Raj Nagar Extension resident, was also candid about not having a valid DL. “My driving licence lapsed four months ago but I continued using it till the new motor vehicles act kicked in. I’m told I will have to wait for a month even though I have applied already.” Tiwary said with more and more people applying for DL in the past few days, the department may look at increasing the number of counters to reduce the waiting time. Sandeep Sodhi, another Ghaziabad resident, was less understanding for having to wait 40 minutes in a queue at the RTO. “Agreed, I should not have waited for the new act to get my licence but given the rush, the RTO should do something to reduce the waiting time. It is 90 days’ delay for getting a learner’s licence.” ARTO for Ghaziabad, Vishwajeet Singh, said, “Since the driving licences are processed online, there is nothing we can do and in one day, only 210 online driving licence applications under the category of learners, permanent and duplicate can be processed.” "

Lucknow,"UP treasury has paid I-T dues of all CMs, ministers since 1981","LUCKNOW: A four-decade-old Uttar Pradesh law puts the tax burden of the chief minister and his council of ministers on the state exchequer as they are deemed to be ""poor"" and “cannot pay income tax from their own meagre earnings”. While many of these ministers, going by the affidavits they file during elections, own movable and immovable assets worth crores of rupees and love flashing their wealth by acquiring swanky SUVs, it is the state, ranked among the poorer ones, which picks up the tax bill. The law, Uttar Pradesh Ministers’ Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Act, 1981, was enacted when V P Singh was chief minister. UP has, since then, witnessed 19 chief ministers — including Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav of Samajwadi Party, Mayawati of Bahujan Samaj Party, Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh of BJP and Narain Dutt Tewari of Congress — and nearly 1,000 ministers from different parties since then, up to the incumbent CM Yogi Adityanath. While getting the bill passed by the state assembly then, Singh had told the House that the state government should bear the income tax burden as most ministers were from poor backgrounds and had meagre incomes. A section of the Act says, “Every minister and minister of state shall be entitled, throughout term of his office, to a salary of one thousand rupees per month. Every deputy minister shall be entitled, throughout the term of his office, to a salary of six hundred and fifty rupees per month. “The salary referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) shall be exclusive of the tax payable in respect of such salary (including perquisites) under any law relating to income tax for the time being in force, and such tax shall be borne by the state government.” Even members of the Yogi government have had their income tax deposited from the state treasury in the last two financial years. This financial year, the income tax bill of Adityanath and his council of ministers was around Rs 86 lakh and was paid from the state treasury. UP principal secretary (finance) Sanjiv Mittal confirmed to TOI that income tax bills of the CM and his council of ministers were paid by the state government as mandated under the 1981 Act.

An SUV also rammed the bus from behind. The driver of none of the buses was wearing a seat belt and the school bus driver suffered limb injuries. This was the eighth accident involving a school bus or van this year. Times ViewIn July, after three back to back accidents involving school bus/vans, the district administration had announced several measures to streamline school transport.

Ghaziabad,"Despite NGT ban, idols immersed in Hindon river","GHAZIABAD: Several devotees managed to immerse idols in Hindon river on Thursday as a 60-metre stretch of the river bank was left unsecured. The district administration had recently said it had fully barricading the banks to deter people from immersion. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Allahabad high court had banned idol immersion in the river to protect it from getting polluted. The state government is also laying emphasis on the restoration of Hindon river, which is considered one of the most polluted rivers in the country, and for that an action plan has also been prepared by the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). When municipal commissioner Dinesh Chandra was told about how people immersed the idols despite the ban, he said, “It is for the administration and the police to check violation of the NGT and Allahabad HC orders on idol immersion in rivers. On our part, we had barricaded the entire stretch of the bank of the Hindon river.” Local divers also helped the devotees immerse their idols despite the cops stationed on the banks of the river. As one devotee, after getting out of his car, headed towards the river bank holding a Ganesh idol, he could be heard requesting divers to get the job done for money. “Please make it fast before the cops see us,” he said.  After hurriedly carrying out the farewell ritual, the devotee handed over the idol to a local diver to immerse it. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey later said, “It seems that despite our efforts some violations have taken place and I have asked the ADM (city) to identify the violators.” Utsav Sharma of UP Pollution Control Board says, “every year due to large scale idol immersion in water bodies especially after Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja the surface water gets highly contaminated.” “This is due to the fact that idols are laced with synthetic and chemicals and during immersion it gets mixed with water and ultimately mixes with ground water contaminating it fully so pollution control board have been issuing directions from time to time to keep a check on this” added Sharma.

Then they started beating me up. I gave them my wallet that had around Rs 5,000 and my ATM and credit cards,” he added. The youths then allegedly asked Ankur to call up a family member and ask the person to transfer Rs 1 lakh to his bank account. When he refused to do so, the youths allegedly stubbed cigarette butts on him. They also asked him for his ATM card’s PIN and withdrew Rs 60,000 using it. “Around 11 pm, the men stopped the car at a dhaba for dinner.

Ghaziabad,"Accident kills man on NH9 stretch that is unlit, dug up","GHAZIABAD: A truck in which nearly 20 people were travelling crashed into an underpass still under construction on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (NH9) late on Wednesday night, leading to the death of a 55-year-old man and leaving 12 injured. The accident site is between Khoda Colony and Indirapuram, on an unlit stretch of the expressway that is dug up in various places as construction continues. Local residents and commuters have for months been expressing concern about safety of drivers on the stretch, particularly at night, because it is has no clear signage cautioning people about spots that may be dangerous, or policemen patrolling the route to keep a watch on rash driving. Almost 24 hours after the accident, on Thursday night, nothing had changed; motorists negotiated the sudden bends and inclines on the partially paved road with nothing but their own headlights to bank on. In portions, iron rods continued to stick dangerously out of concrete. The man who died by was identified by police as Shyam Lal. He was with a group that was returning from Garh Mukteshwar after idol immersion. The injured are being treated at a private hospital in Delhi’s Patparganj. Darshan, who was also in the truck, said driver was speeding and did not spot a pothole on the dark stretch. “One of the tyres got stuck in the pothole, which led to accident,” said Darshan, a relative of Shyam Lal. The driver got out of the truck and fled. RP Singh, project director with the National Highways Authority of India which is overseeing the Delhi-Meerut Expressway construction, said it the accident was the driver’s fault. “I am aware of the accident. I have been told the driver was allegedly under the influence, which might have led to the accident,” Singh said. Asked about the safety worries that the stretch throws up, he added, “The diversion is in place for quite some time now and we have also placed proper reflector signage at all vulnerable spots, including this one.” Sandeep Kumar Singh, SHO of Khoda police station, said police got information about the accident from a passerby. “Shyam Lal was admitted to Max Hospital and died during treatment at 11am on Thursday,” said Sandeep Singh, SHO of Khoda. “An FIR has been registered against the truck’s driver section 304A (death due to negligence) of the IPC. We have seized the truck and efforts are being made to nab the driver,” said Shlok Kumar, SP (city). Among those injured are Brahm Singh (50), Sunil Singh (30), Kuldeep (53), Deepak (28) and Suraj (19). "
Ghaziabad,Newly built Meerut Road starts to crumble,"GHAZIABAD: The state public works department (PWD) has written to the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), expressing its displeasure over broken stretches on the recently constructed Delhi-Meerut Road. The PWD wants the renovation of the broken road, which it believes was constructed using sub-standard materials. “The central verge along the 10km stretch of Delhi-Meerut Road from Meerut tri-section till Raj Nagar is being developed by NCRTC for its Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor and the corporation was required to construct an extra lane on the said stretch that it did in parts,” said Manish Verma, executive engineer, PWD. “But the stretch which was developed by NCRTC is already broken at many places, which is resulting in traffic jams. So, we have asked the corporation to repair the stretch,” he added. The NCRTC has refuted the allegation that sub-standard material was used in construction of the road. “The design parameter and specification was the same, which is employed by PWD, and we had got quality audit done by IIT-Roorkee so there’s no truth in the allegation,” said an NCRTC official. “But we do admit that roads are broken at many places, which is due to other reasons and now that monsoon is over, we’ll start the repair work,” the official said. The 82 km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor, from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Modipuram in Meerut, will have 22 stations, including four in Ghaziabad, and trains will run at a speed of 100 km per hour. This means one can commute from one city to the other in just 55 minutes. While 80% of the project will be on elevated platform, 20% will be underground, NCRTC officials had said. "

""I have lots of friends in Mumbai who are from Lucknow. They’ve told me a lot about the chikan kurtas here. They told me that shopping is a must if you go to Lucknow,"" said newbie Sahher. Karan too had heard some really good things about the city from dad Sunny. “Dad had shot for 'Gadar: Ek Prem Katha' in Lucknow. And even though before coming to Lucknow I couldn’t get the time to talk him, he had told me that Lucknow ka food is a must try. He told me to try the kebabs and the biryani without fail. My father and I are both foodies,"" said an excited Karan. FIRST DAY JITTERSTalking about their debut film 'Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas', Karan shared with us the experience of the first day of his shoot and how he faced not only the camera, but his dad behind the camera too. ""For the first shot, mujhe ek truck chalani thi and ek particular mark pe rokni thi. I wondered how tough could it possibly be. Bas truck mark pe roko, roll down the window, chashma nikalo, dialogue bolo aur ho gaya. But it was actually easier said than done! First time main mark se pehle ruk gaya, phir mark ke aage chala gaya, teesri baar toh gaadi ruk gayi. So I was like kya yaar, I can’t get this simple shot done. Everyone was looking at me and my hands started shaking. I started crying. I was like I don’t think it’ll work for me as I can’t even get this simple shot done right,"" said Karan, adding ""Luckily it was the first-day nerves only, the next day was better. Dad would later on tell me at home where I went wrong and how I should work on it. Thanks to all his support, I owe my personal and acting growth to him."" Karan Deol in Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Karan Deol in Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) FRIENDS FOR LIFEDuring the promotions of their first film 'Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas', rumour mills were abuzz about how Karan and Sahher didn’t share a very cordial bond in the beginning. The actress claimed that, ""Inherently, Karan is a shy person. We would mostly just talk about work in the beginning, our friendship grew over time. It was this party we had in Manali, like our whole crew. At that party we ended up enjoying and chilling, it was fun. I feel that was the real icebreaking moment for us. Now, I can say that we’re friends for life,"" said Sahher. FRESH AND HAPPENING!Sahher, the Shimla girl who won the Mumbai finals of Oppo Bombay Times Fresh Face 2016 organised by the Times of India, got selected for this film after a couple of auditions. She said, ""When I came to Mumbai, my actual struggle started because I didn’t know who to meet, but I started auditioning here and there. Just to prepare myself a little bit in whatever little capacity, I thought a pageant is a good option because I’ll get some sort of exposure and I’ll learn how to answer questions, then it might help me even overcome stage fright. It just gave me a lot of confidence and I got a little comfortable with the cameras being around. When I won the Fresh Face in Mumbai, I got a call from the casting director to audition for this film."" After giving her 100% in the auditions that happened over a period of a month, Sahher got a call in February 2017 that she had been selected.

I’m not going to tell you who all I met. We all have our own struggles and work just like anybody else. Your struggles are different from mine. It's as simple as that."" VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE Ever since new-age actors like Vicky Kaushal and Ayushmann Khurrana have been doing content-driven films, more stars are becoming open to trying different and out of the box roles. Speaking about the same Karan said, ""I’d love to try out comedy or to even play a villain. As an actor you can’t stay stuck with one zone otherwise it becomes boring. These days scripts speak, quality content speaks. I’d even like to try the digital space as it’s a wider range with more freedom. With digital you can actually explore yourself a little bit more because it doesn’t have much baggage, it doesn’t have any censorship issue. You can just create anything to your heart’s content."" Sahher seemed very excited when asked about getting to play a negative role. ""I think it’s very exciting to play a negative role. I’d love to try it out. I’m also open to doing something on digital platforms,"" she said. Speaking about healthy competition and standing together as a unit with the contemporaries, Karan said, “We’re all peers and we should work together. As a film fraternity we should be one unit rather than compete among ourselves because if we’re a unit and we support each other, we can take it ahead. Eventually, we’re all doing it for the same reason; we love it, so might as well do it together.” HOW ABOUT THE ARJUN REMAKE?Recently, Karan also made news for showing a keen interest in doing a remake of his father’s film Arjun while his dad Sunny said he didn’t want Karan to do remakes of films. Ask this young lad more on this and he said, ""My father believes that someone should not make a remake for just cashing in on the perspective. If there’s something concrete and made strong with a good director, then it’s okay. I shall however try my best to convince my father to let me act in remakes and if I get the chance, I’d love to do Arjun which happens to be my father’s favourite film."" LOVE FOR ANIMALSA view of both Karan and Sahher’s Instagram account shows their love for animals. ""I’ve got two labradors, Lui and Coco. Lui doesn’t like to be pet or hugged, whereas Coco, she’ll come affectionately, she likes to be loved, she’s all jumpy. They’re my biggest stress-busters,” said Karan, adding, “Every time I go home and play with them they smile at me, irrespective of my mood. That really cheers me up, my babies are so loving. My house has always had dogs or cats. Lui and Coco are like my own kids. If anything happens to them, I get very worked up."" Sahher, who now stays in Mumbai, doesn’t have any pets of her own but loves being around animals. She said, ""I think the love that you receive from animals is unconditional and they’re your biggest stress-buster. I feel all of us should really do our bit for them, be it adopting or feeding them or just do something for them. One of my biggest aims in life is to adopt strays or just create awareness about helping them."" — Akash.Wadhwa@timesgroup.com and Yashi Agarwal "
Lucknow,UP to repeal law that makes treasury pay ministers’ income tax,"LUCKNOW: A day after TOI exclusively reported that the Uttar Pradesh treasury has been paying income tax of the state’s chief ministers and his council of ministers for nearly four decades thanks to a law enacted in 1981, CM Yogi Adityanath on Friday swiftly announced repeal of the controversial provision in the Act. On Thursday, TOI had reported about the law that put the tax burden of the CM and his council of ministers on the state exchequer as they are deemed to be ""poor"" and “cannot pay income tax from their own meagre earnings”. The law, Uttar Pradesh Ministers’ Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Act, 1981, was enacted when V P Singh was chief minister. UP treasury has paid I-T dues of all CMs, ministers since 1981UP has witnessed 19 chief ministers — including Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav of Samajwadi Party, Mayawati of Bahujan Samaj Party, Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh of BJP and ND Tiwari of Congress — since the law was enacted. There have been nearly 1,000 ministers since then. While many of them, going by the affidavits they file during elections, own movable and immovable assets worth crores of rupees and love flashing their wealth by acquiring swanky SUVs, it is the state, ranked among the poorer ones, which picks up the tax bill. On Friday, Yogi telephoned finance minister Suresh Khanna, who also holds parliamentary affairs and medical education portfolios, and asked him to prepare a proposal for cabinet approval before tabling it in assembly. “The chief minister directed scrapping of all archaic laws. After a detailed discussion, he asked me to quickly draft a proposal for cabinet nod. We will not bear the sins of the Congress government,” Khanna told TOI. The move to revisit the 38-year-old law followed outrage within the government and outside about how wealthy ministers deemed to be “poor” were shifting their tax burden on the common man. In 1981, while getting the Uttar Pradesh Ministers’ Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Bill 1981 passed by the vidhan sabha, VP Singh had told the House that the state government should bear the income tax burden as most ministers were from poor backgrounds and had meagre incomes. A section of the Act says, “Every minister and minister of state shall be entitled, throughout term of his office, to a salary of one thousand rupees per month. Every deputy minister shall be entitled, throughout the term of his office, to a salary of six hundred and fifty rupees per month. “The salary referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) shall be exclusive of the tax payable in respect of such salary (including perquisites) under any law relating to income tax for the time being in force, and such tax shall be borne by the state government.” Even members of the Yogi government have had their income tax deposited from the state treasury in the last two financial years. This financial year, the income tax bill of Adityanath and his council of ministers was around Rs 86 lakh and was paid from the state treasury. UP principal secretary (finance) Sanjiv Mittal confirmed to TOI that income tax bills of the CM and his council of ministers were paid by the state government as mandated under the 1981 Act. UP minister and government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh said the 1981 law could be revisited if all legislators support the move. Another cabinet minister Srikant Sharma told TOI the chief minister is determined to repeal obsolete laws, which are a baggage of earlier regimes. At least three cabinet ministers in the Yogi government had sought repeal of the controversial provision in the forthcoming special assembly session from October 1 as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. A former minister in the Congress government, Ram Krishna Dwivedi, described this provision as immoral and against constitutional propriety. He wanted it scrapped immediately. Congress spokesperson Surendra Rajput said the income tax buffer for ministers may have been justifiable 40 years ago when they would get a paltry monthly salary of Rs 1,000, but now chief ministers and the ministers have assets worth crores of rupees. “If their income tax is being paid by the state government, it’s criminal,” he said.

Lucknow,"Own a dog in Ghaziabad? You may have to pay Rs 5,000","GHAZIABAD: Dog owners in Ghaziabad may soon have to register their pets, for a fee as high as Rs 5,000, and pay fines if they don’t clean up after their canine. The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation board met on Friday and passed proposals to regulate pet ownership. GMC asked its councillors for suggestions on how to go about this. “A lot of things were covered – from rules governing registration to how much fines should be charged. We left the job to an expert committee that can frame the rules that can be incorporated in the bylaws,” said AK Mishra, a GMC officer. The rules will come into effect after the GMC incorporates them in its bylaws. While Delhi and Gurugram have notified rules mandating pet registration, Noida is yet to do so. To register as a pet owner, some formalities have to be taken care of. “Under other municipalities, the dog’s vaccination card, address and information about breed have to be provided. I think the process will be the same in Ghaziabad. The registration fee and fine amount may be different,” AK Singh, veterinary officer, GMC, said. “There were suggestions that pet owners be charged Rs 5,000 for registration annually and a fine of Rs 500 be imposed for allowing a dog to poop in the open. These were suggestions. The committee will study pet laws in the country before settling on the rules that will apply here,” Mishra said. If GMC follows through on these proposals, the registration fee in Ghaziabad will be much higher than in other places that have mandated it. In Delhi, the annual registration fee is Rs 500. In Lucknow, pet owners have to pay Rs 500 a year for the registration of big breeds like Doberman or Labrador and Rs 300 for smaller breeds, like Pomeranian or Spitz. The steep charge proposed to GMC had been brought up earlier. “Last year, after a similar proposal, I had suggested that it be brought down to Rs 500. For some reason, the proposal fizzled out,” Sumedha Aiyer, a former member of People for Animals, said. Tackling monkey menace GMC board gave nod to float tenders for catching monkeys. “Last year, we roped in professional monkey catchers from Mathura, but animal rights organisations questioned the manner in which monkeys were caught. This time, we will seek help from the forest department ,” Mishra said. "

The only problem was that he was in Mahanagar. In fact, he had never been to NYC of the US for that matter. The 28-year-old businessman is among two recent victims of possible card cloning, a crime that has seen a spurt this year. Together, they have been conned out of Rs 1.32 lakh in less than a month. Arora, who owns a confectionery store in Aminabad, said he was home when he received the text alert about Rs 82,463 (approximately after conversion) being spent on his credit card. He immediately called his bank on the toll-free helpline and got the card blocked. Later, he lodged a police complaint. “I have never been to the US. A couple of months ago though, I visited South East Asia and Delhi. I am well aware of card frauds and take necessary precautions. I have no idea how it happened to me,” Arora told TOI. In the other case, private company executive Santosh Kumar Srivastava lost Rs 50,000 from his bank savings account in six instalments on August 18. He lodged an FIR on Thursday with Mahanagar police because his bank branch is in Nishatganj. Srivastava, who earlier lived and worked in Lucknow, moved to his native place in Ambedkarnagar in May. On August 18, he received an alert around 10.35pm about Rs 5,000 being withdrawn from an ATM on Sapru Marg. It was followed by five more withdrawals in two hours. Since he could not reach the bank through its toll-free number that day, Srivastava contacted his branch in Lucknow on the next working day and got his debit card blocked. “I ran from pillar to post for a month to get an FIR lodged. Finally, following the SSP’s intervention, Mahanagar police took my complaint. A case was registered on Thursday,” he said. Mahanagar SHO Ashok Singh said both cases seemed to be of card cloning and they were taking the help of Lucknow Police cyber cell to crack the same. "
Lucknow,KGMU suspends resident doctor for harassing patient’s daughter,"LUCKNOW: King George’s Medical University (KGMU) on Friday suspended a junior resident doctor in the department of radiotherapy and sacked a ward boy after preliminary probe found them guilty of sexually harassing the daughter of a cancer patient. A fine of Rs 25,000 has also been imposed on the agency through which the ward boy was hired on contract basis while he has been barred from entering the campus. KGMU proctor professor RAS Kushwaha said a four-member committee, led by Dr Sunita Tiwari (head of physiology) and comprising Dr Anup Verma (head of forensics), Dr BK Ojha (head of neurosurgery) and Dr Sujata Dev (gynaecology professor), had been formed for a thorough probe against the thrid-year junior resident. The committee will submit its report in three days. In her complaint, the 16-year-old girl from Sitapur said the junior resident, who was drunk, summoned her to the residents’ chamber on the pretext of giving her medicines for her mother on Tuesday night, but sexually harassed her. He threatened to stop her mother’s treatment when she protested. The minor girl, however, shared her ordeal with a few nurses who encouraged her to lodge an official complaint. She met the head of radiotherapy, professor Rajeev Gupta, on Thursday and filed a written complaint. When the case was highlighted by a section of the media, the KGMU authorities directed professor Gupta to conduct a preliminary inquiry and submit a report. Based on CCTV camera footage and statements of nursing staff, the probe found the allegations against the junior resident to be true. It also found that a ward boy was involved.  President of Resident Doctors’ Association Rahul Bharat said the accused junior resident had recently misbehaved with the wife of a colleague as well.“We will lodge a complaint in this regard with the KGMU administration,” he added. The accused resident denied all the allegations and called it a conspiracy. “I came to the residents’ room on Tuesday night to take a pen drive. I saw the girl with the ward boy in a compromising state. I rebuked both and warned them that I would report the matter to the authorities. The girl later falsely implicated me. Everything will be clear if the authorities examine CCTV footage more thoroughly,” he said. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)"

The inspection covered eight areas in and around the city, namely Indiranagar, Khadra, Chinhat, Maal, Malihabad, Itaunja, Mohanlalganj and Malihabad. Five quacks each were caught in Mohanlalganj and Maal, followed by four in Malihabad and three in Itaunja.

However, he conceded, this was the first time that a massive drive had been launched following court directives. "
Lucknow,KGMU can now screen 100 tuberculosis cases daily,"LUCKNOW: King George's Medical University (KGMU) will now be able to diagnose 100 patients for tuberculosis each day, all thanks to a machine upgrade. The '16 modile geneXpert' machine can not only confirm a TB case, but can also help in treatment by detecting which drugs a patient is resistant to.  The current machine installed in KGMU's microbiology department can diagnose only 20 patients in a day. Often KGMU had to send samples to other labs whenever the patient rush got out of hand.  Head of Microbiology department, Amita Jain said, ""As we can identify a patient's drug resistance to TB bacteria, it will be easier for us to find out which medicines work best for a particular case.""

Lucknow,70-year-old shot at over sons' disputes in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: A 70-year-old man was shot at by three men while he was asleep outside his home over an old rivalry in Mall on Friday.

Lucknow,Finally suicide? Murder FIR against IAS officer to be expunged,"LUCKNOW: Having concluded that the death of Anita Singh, wife of IAS officer Umesh Pratap Singh, was a suicide, police are now preparing to file a final report with the application in court to expunge the murder FIR against her husband. Advocate Rajeev Singh, Anita’s cousin on whose complaint the FIR was lodged against SUDA director Umesh, said he would file an objection in court against the application because police investigations hadn’t answered several questions in the case. Diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic over a year ago, 42-year-old Anit died of a gunshot wound in her room at their Vikalp Khand home on September 1. Based on the family’s statements, circumstantial evidence and forensic and autopsy reports, police concluded that Anita shot herself with her licensed pistol. On September 5, before police officially labelled Anita’s death as suicide, her cousin Rajeev accused her husband of having extramarital affairs and also of killing her. He raised questions such as an unexplained contusion at the back of her head and why she was allowed access to a loaded pistol if she was under medication. Chinhat SHO Sachin Singh contended that a team from the forensic science lab recreated the firing scene and submitted a report that said Anita killed herself. The FSL analysis matched with the inference after postmortem examination, besides circumstanstial evidence and statements of witnesses present in the house. “We have found adequate evidence to support the husband’s claims, like she was mentally ill, wanted to move to Haridwar alone and that her door was locked from inside. We also found her firearm at the scene along with the bullet that perforated her body. Hence, we will move an application in court and request it to expunge the murder FIR,” the SHO said. Advocate Rajeev said besides contesting the police application, he would move a higher court — if required — for a fair probe. "

Lucknow,Lucknow Development Authority seals neta’s ‘illegal’ apartment,"LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) has sealed an under-construction residential building being developed by a former MP and erstwhile BSP leader because it allegedly flouts the sanctioned plan. According to LDA officials, the former MP was given permission to raise a single-floor housing unit in Wazirganj, but he had instead constructed a six-storey apartment. “After we came to know of the irregularity, notices were served to the promoter on several occasions.

Lucknow,Lucknow: How daddy’s little girl is turning dreams into reality,"LUCKNOW: Behind every successful daughter is one truly amazing dad. Seventeen-year-old Chanchal, a candidate at the Military Police recruitment rally here on Friday, will vouch for it. “My father is like Aamir Khan (who played Mahavir Singh Phogat in the film Dangal). He believes, ‘chhoriyan chhoro se kam ni hai (girls are no less than boys)’,” said the daughter of a labourer from Badaun, the youngest among 448 candidates from 25 districts participating in the second leg of the Lucknow camp.  A participant enters a race at the Military Police recruitment rally on FridayIt wasn’t until 2008 that Chanchal’s father Shyam Singh realised his daughter was one gutsy girl. “I was 10. A boy made fun of girls in our village and I challenged him to a 100m race. Guess who won!” the teen said with a twinkle in her eyes. From that day, Singh began training his daughter to be a sprinter. “When the Indian Army announced that 100 women will be inducted to the Corps of Military Police, he said I should put my training to use and serve the country,” she said.  A girl waits on the ground with a family memberChanchal is not the only aspiring soldier who owes her confidence and determination to a doting daddy. Shivani Yadav of Aligarh would have been a timid girl, but for her father. He wanted to join the defence academy, but failed. He trained his daughter so that she didn’t. “We woke up at 3am every day. We ran and exercised. The regime was strict. He boosted my confidence and when I was tired, he even massaged my feet,” Shivani recalled, adding that she owed her courage to participate in the recruitment rally to her farmer father. Jolly Yadav from Meerut said she was fulfilling her late father’s dream. “He wanted me to serve the nation. He said I could work for Delhi Police or be a fighter pilot. I lost him three years ago, but his belief in me inspired me to come here,” said the 20-year-old. The third leg of the Lucknow recruitment rally will take place on Saturday. Candidates from 12 districts of Uttar Pradesh and 14 of Uttarakhand will take part. Read this story in Bengali"
Lucknow,Undervalued tax bills cost Lucknow civic body Rs 20 crore in 4 years,"LUCKNOW: Owners of over 1.5 lakh houses out of total 5.48 lakh in the city are paying undervalued house tax resulting in a loss of Rs 20 crore to the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) in the last four years, according to a Geographical Index Survey (GIS) conducted by a private agency hired by the civic body. LMC will now send notices to defaulters, who constitute 19% of total taxpayers, for recovery of dues. LMC’s chief tax in charge Ashok Singh said, “House tax is based on self-assessment of floor area. Owners of these properties misinformed us about the actual floor area of their houses, which reduced the tax amount.” TimesViewIt is difficult to believe that taxpayers were able to evade taxes worth lakhs of rupees for such a long period without any help from an insider. It is important to note that the GIS mapping was launched following complaints of discrepancies in measurement of floor area of houses. Apart from cracking a whip on defaulters, LMC must conduct a thorough probe and take action against employees responsible for verifying residents’ tax self-assessment.Initially, LMC conducted the survey in Gomtinagar and Gomtinagar Extension and found that out of 40,000 households nearly 7,000 were paying less house tax. Later, hundreds of house owners in Mahanagar, Indiranagar and Vikasnagar were also found paying undervalued tax. As the survey has been completed, the database will now be maintained in newly-constructed command and control centre for assessment and tax collection. Officials said notices are being served to defaulters asking them to pay the dues within two months, failing which construction on area not shown in assessment will be demolished. From now on, zonal officers will conduct verification of selfassessment of new houses and commercial units,” municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said. "
Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh to use Japanese technology to grow dense canopy of 25 crore trees,"LUCKNOW: The state government plans to use the Miyawaki method, a Japanese plantation technique that facilitates dense cover in short time and minimal space, to grow 25 crore saplings in UP next year. The government will enter lease agreements with farmers to raise nurseries on their land and meet the demand for saplings, forest and environment minister Dara Singh Chauhan indicated on Friday as he directed officials to start preparations for the mega exercise. The pioneering plantation technique is named after Japanese botanist and plant ecologist Akira Miyawaki who specialises in seeds and study of natural forests. He is active worldwide as a specialist in the restoration of natural vegetation on degraded land. Using his method, it is possible to grow a variety of native species in as little space as 600sqft. In other words, you can have a mini-forest in your backyard. Sources said land available with the railways, defence and agricultural universities will be surveyed for plantation. Major portion of the budget will be sourced through MNREGA. The nurseries existing in the state and with central government departments will be linked with the forest department’s nursery management system. Cattle-proof trenches will be made to protect the trees. He directed the officials to identify “model plantations” in rural and urban areas and highlight the same to encourage green cover. "
Lucknow,"BJP attacking Azam Khan for no reason, says Akhilesh Yadav","LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav may have reached Rampur around 10pm on Friday, around four hours behind schedule leaving the district administration on its toes all evening. The authorities had a tough time keeping a tab on the party workers who thronged Humsafar resort where the former CM will put up for the night. The authorities are expecting a long day on Saturday with reports of Akhilesh visiting senior SP leader Azam Khan at his residence and then holding an impromptu demonstration in the city against the FIRs being lodged against Azam, who is among the founding members of the party and a close aide of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Akhilesh, who was supposed to reach Rampur by 6pm, reached around 10pm and was escorted to Humsafar Resort—a property owned by Khan’s family. Later, he came out to address thousands of party workers who had gathered to catch a glimpse of the former CM where he attacked the ruling BJP for attacking Khan with FIRs based on “frivolous” complaints. “Azam Khan Sahab’s only fault or crime is that he had got the Jauhar University built and it is imparting education,” Akhilesh said adding that FIRs on goat and cattle theft complaints only reflect how desperate the government was to defame a leader like Khan who has not been accused of any wrongdoing throughout his political career spanning over four decades. Earlier, party workers had a tough time reaching Rampur with police in the bordering districts doing everything possible to check assembly of workers in Rampur. The police crackdown was such that SP’s district unit president of Sambhal, Firoz Khan, tricked the police by covering his face with a groom’s ‘sehra’ and succeeded in entering Rampur. "

Lying in doldrums since November 2016, the authorities are working on price of ticket and other facilities that would be offered to visitors in the safari. Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW), UP, Sunil Pandey said the forest department would send a proposal to the state government to inaugurate the safari. “Deer and antelope safaris are ready. We would propose to throw open the facilities to people,” said the official. Lion safari in Etawah is a 350-hectare area. Besides, a safari and a breeding centre for lions, safaris for deer, antelope, bear and leopards were also a part of the project. Deer and antelope safaris were completed in 2016.  While the 150 hectare of it has safaris, it’s also the first in the country to have a lion breeding centre set up with an aim to develop a research facility on Asiatic lions. Though visitors may have to wait for lion safari as CZA has fixed 10 cubs as the minimum strength for the safari and the place, at present, has only six cubs, the facilities that are ready like a 3D theatre would be inaugurated. Bear and leopard safaris may be the added attractions in the days to come. "
Lucknow,KGMU for major revamp in mental health sector,"LUCKNOW: While 90% people in UP have experienced stress in the past year, the state has only one psychiatrist and one psychologist for every one lakh population. In the wake of this acute crisis, King George’s Medical University (KGMU) on Thursday recommended a major manpower boost in the mental health sector. The psychiatry and community medicine departments of KGMU, with support from UP Health Strengthening System Project, had interviewed 12,000 respondents from Maharajganj, Muzaffarnagar, Jhansi and Lakhimpur Kheri districts. Based on the results, which also pointed to a vicious stress-social medial cycle, a 10-point advisory has been given to the government. “The state has just one psychiatrist for every one lakh people. According to the 1946 Bhore Committee recommendations, there should be at least 10 experts per 1 lakh people. The state needs to boost manpower in the sector. In addition, the negatives of excessive social media use should be highlighted in schools and students should be engaged in more physical activities,” said Dr Sujit Kar, a member of the research team from the psychiatry department. The study found high level of stress among adolescents, which was related to education. For this, the KGMU has recommended overhauling of school syllabuses and inclusion of counsellors. “The government should also consider developing a stress-monitoring mobile phone application or spread awareness about such apps already available,” Dr Kar added. Expanding the mental health programme from 45 to all the 75 districts in UP, training of anganwadi workers for mental health screening at primary level and strict enforcement of de-addiction laws to combat substance abuse are also some of the recommendations made to the government.

Lucknow,"UP: Khaki brutality clip goes viral, victim called drunkard","LUCKNOW/GORAKHPUR: After a 2.39-minute video of cops torturing a 25-year-old in front of his five-year-old nephew went viral, Siddharthnagar police tried to justify its act on Friday by accusing the man of being drunk. However, the men in khaki based their allegations on hearsay without a blood alcohol test. The victim's father claimed his son wasn't tipsy and cops thrashed him for not carrying registration papers of the vehicle. Siddharthnagar police suspended the two constables and registered a case against them. An inquiry was ordered under an ASP-rank officer.

Their action was unwarranted,"" said Singh. He said since Rinku did not suffer injury due to the assault, the cops have been booked for public service disobedience law with intention to cause injury, punishment for voluntary causing hurt, breach of peace and criminal intimidation. The SP denied that Rinku was assaulted on pretext of not showing registration papers. "
Kanpur,"Man convicted in dowry death case, gets ten years rigorous imprisonment in Kanpur","KANPUR: Additional district and sessions judge (XXII), Kanpur Nagar, Mohd Shafeeq, on Friday sentenced accused Ravi Balmiki to ten years rigorous imprisonment and also slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 for dowry death and committing cruelty on his wife. The court acquitted the accused’s parents due to lack of evidence against them. Presenting his case before the court, additional district government counsel (ADGC) Sanjay Sahu stated that Waseema, sister of deceased Nazima had lodged the FIR on September 15, 2015. Nazima and Ravi Balmiki, after getting married, started living at Rawatpur in Kalyanpur police circle. On September 12, 2015, Nazima had gone to her parents’ house to attend her younger sister Afreen’s marriage scheduled for September 16, 2015. On September 14, 2015, Ravi went to his inlaws’ house, thrashed his wife Nazima and brought her back to his house, the prosecution told the court. Humiliated over severe beating, Nazima committed suicide by hanging herself from the roof of her room on September 15 afternoon. Waseema in her FIR stated that Ravi used to treat Nazima cruelly and often forced her to fetch money from her parents’ house. They had already given him Rs 25,000 twice. During arguments, the defence pleaded that Ravi and Nazima were not legally married and were living in live-in-relationship. But the court, after going through the evidence on record, rejected the live-in relationship theory and observed that this relationship also has the same object and it is common in high societies. Nazima lived in Ravi’s house along with his parents like a married woman and her status was of a legally wedded wife, the court observed. In another judgment, additional district and sessions judge Kapila Raghav convicted hardware engineer Ashwini Singh for physically exploiting a girl and sentenced him to seven years rigorous imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs 35,000. The court observed in its order that 60% of the fine amount would be given to the victim. "
Kanpur,"Portion of P. Road caves in, traffic hit","KANPUR: A major portion of a section of P. Road caved in on Friday. The deep crater formed was enough to engulf a two-wheeler. The incident caused panic among locals and the commuters. Soon the locals of the area barricaded the caved-in road with sticks and bricks which caused traffic snarls, and the commuters had to take a longer route to reach their destination. This is not the first time that the road has caved-in. Locals told reporters that road on the entire stretch of P. Road had caved-in in the past as well probably because of leakage in the pipeline running underground.

Jal Nigam authorities have started repairing the road by placing proper barricades in and around the road. It is expected that the road would be leveled in a few days time, said a jal nigam official.

Ghaziabad,Shops in residential areas? GDA may give nod,"GHAZIABAD: Faced with regular protests over Ghaziabad Development Authority’s action against commercial establishments running from residential areas, the development authority may give conditional consent to regularise such spaces. A proposal to this effect is being prepared by the GDA, which will be sent to the state government for approval and following that a conditional consent could be granted. “There are some criteria under which we may allow regularisation of commercial establishments operating from residential areas, like road outside such shops should be 24m to 30m wide. It would, to some extent, assuage the concern of residents who often complain that due to commercial activities in residential areas, roads near them remain clogged,” said Kanchan Verma, vice-chairperson, GDA. “Also, we will allow commercial activities only on the ground floors of residential buildings. In fact, there is a 2011 government order in this regard,” Verma added. While GDA may allow commercial activities in residential areas, it would not be for the entire year. “We’ll give a fixed time frame within which people willing to regularise their shops will have to apply. No applications will be entertained after that,” said Verma. Citing an example through Bareilly Development Authority, Verma said a similar situation had risen there. “The development authority allowed conditional operation and got the desired result,” said Verma. In Ghaziabad, the matter had come to light when GDA reopened VDH Store in Kavinagar, three months after it was sealed, following a fire at a restaurant that had been opearting operating on the first floor of the store. “The store met the criteria. So, was allowed to operate after the owner paid 25% of the existing circle rate,” said Verma. "

He adds, ""I was a prince and I had no boundaries as an actor, I could cry the way I wanted, laughed the way I wanted. The thing about playing Buddha was that the role had all the nine emotions of acting. Acting is all about the nine rasa and jitne bhi roles hote hain mostly do ya teen emotions tak hi limited hote hain. But playing Buddha, I had to express all the nine rasa or emotions.

Lucknow,UMTA to streamline UP urban transport,"LUCKNOW: The daily commuting experience of urban transport users will be upgraded by several notches with a common authority, UMTA, that will not only standardize but also coordinate various modes of transport. This will cut down travel time and make it less hectic an experience for daily commuters to board a public transport. The state government is planning to put in place a Urban Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA), which sources said, would be an apex body to ensure ‘coordinated planning and implementation of urban transport programmes and projects and an integrated management of urban transport systems. It would also regulate fare for different types of city transport. The authority will have institutions and departments that operate various modes of urban transport like Metro, city buses, CNG-driven public transport, battery-operated vehicles and other local means of transport available in cities. The proposal on UMTA has been sent to the state cabinet for approval. A top official said, “UMTA would act as a mediator between organizations operating various modes of city transport and the state government.” The authority would be under the state government and have representation from departments, including urban development and planning, housing, PWD, municipal corporations, Metro rail corporations, transport directorate, UPSRTC, energy and Regional Transport Authorities. “Every department that has a role in smooth operation of public transport will be a part of the authority,” said sources. To create a corpus, the authority will get a certain percentage from cess realised by the state government. Sources said, UP is planning to put UMTA in place for several years. The state has also participated in workshops that have been organised by the Centre on setting up UMTAs in the states. “Though much has happened on paper for UMTA, nothing has happened on the ground,” said sources.

Lucknow,"Two UP cops booked for attempt to murder, SHO suspended","LUCKNOW: The two policemen, who had assaulted a youth, Rinku Pandey, in public on Tuesday and had been suspended on Friday after a video of the two raining kicks, punches, slaps and abuses went viral, were also booked on charges of attempt to murder later. The SHO of Khesraha police station was also suspended. The two policemen, Sakarpar police outpost in-charge, Virendra Mishra, and head constable, Mahendra Prasad, had been earlier booked under sections 166 (public service disobedience law with intention to cause injury), 323 (punishment for causing voluntary hurt), 504 (breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. Siddharthnagar SP, Dharm Veer Singh, who had defended the policemen and said Pandey was drunk, said on Saturday that the report of the inquiry conducted by an ASP-rank officer found the action of policemen was barbaric and hence, section 307 was added. The SHO of Khesraha police station, Ramashish Yadav, has also been suspended, since he did not ensure blood test of Pandey to prove he was drunk,” said Singh.Speaking to TOI on Saturday, Pandey, who runs a mobile repair shop in Kurja village, said he was thrashed for refusing to recharge the phone of one Akhtar Hussain. Recalling the incident, Pandey said, “It was 3pm on September 10, I had closed my shop, Raj Mobiles, for the day and was going with my five-year-old niece to see Muharram procession. Akhtar came and asked me to recharge his phone. I told him that I was going to show Muharram procession to my niece and left. I had hardly gone 100m when Akhtar stopped me and warned of dire consequences.” ‘My father pleaded for cops’ mercy’“I drove some distance but was stopped by sub-inspector Mishra and head constable Prasad. They thrashed me without reason, took me to Sakarpar police outpost and whipped me. They released me only when my father came and pleaded for mercy,” he added. Pandey claimed that his niece has taken ill after witnessing the incident. Domariyaganj MP, Jagdambika Pal visited Pandey at his house on Saturday. “I visited the youth and assured justice. Our government is against such high-handedness. An FIR has been lodged and cops have been suspended. Strict action will be taken,” he told reporters. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Wife secretly buys self holiday for Rs 25,000; gamer kid siphons off dad’s Rs 11,000","LUCKNOW: A woman in Gomtinagar used her husband’s credit card and e-wallet account without his knowledge to buy herself a 10-day holiday in Goa for Rs 25,000 and convinced him that she had won the paid vacation in a contest. The unsuspecting man, a real estate dealer by profession, had no clue about his reduced bank balance until he visited his branch to get his passbook updated as a matter of routine. When he realised the money was missing, he thought he was a victim of cyber fraud and lodged an FIR in late August. Police investigation turned the needle of suspicion towards his wife who had cleverly erased bank transaction alerts from his phone to ensure he wouldn’t notice the difference until she returned from her trip. In another case, which took place in July, a 12-year-old schoolboy siphoned off Rs 11,000 from his father’s bank savings account through an e-wallet to download and play an online game that promised a fat cash prize. This case is similar to one cracked a week ago in which an eight-year-old had swindled his father out of Rs 35,000. According to sleuths of Lucknow Police cyber cell, they receive three-four cases of online fraud on a daily average. Nodal officer of cyber cell Abhay Mishra confirmed that two fresh cases of family members stealing from digital accounts had come to the fore. “The real estate dealer’s credit card and phone number are linked to his e-wallet. He always kept the card at his residence and only his wife had access to it. During probe, we found his mobile number was used to make the payment for the Goa holiday via the e-wallet. On being quizzed, his wife confessed she had used the same and even deleted SMS alerts from the bank,” Mishra said. In the other case, also reported from Gomtinagar, the Class VI student of a reputable school was found to be addicted to an online game called Rummy. It promised a grand prize of Rs 2 lakh to the winner. So, he stole Rs 11,000 from his schoolteacher father’s account to play, but deleted the game when he lost. “The teacher had lodged an FIR in July. In this case too, an e-wallet was used. We questioned both sons of the complainant, his wife and also his mother. Scrutiny of the teacher’s phone showed the game was installed and later uninstalled. We found only the younger son knew how to play it. On being questioned, he confessed,” Mishra said. The cyber cell nodal officer added that both complaints had been withdrawn. "
Lucknow,Cash-strapped LMC may cut development budget,"LUCKNOW: Brace for a bumpy ride on pothole-ridden roads and pungent smell engulfing your area due to garbage pile-up and choked drains. Poor house tax collection by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) may hit civic works like road repair, garbage collection and cleaning of drains in different parts of the city. Against the target of Rs 260 crore in 2019-20, LMC has so far been able to collect just Rs 110 crore (40%) despite rolling out concessions under the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme. The drive of ‘naming and shaming’ defaulters has also not yielded desired results. LMC’s assessment reveals that this year, around 3.3 lakh registered properties have not paid their taxes. According to rules, house tax due in a financial year is paid in the next fiscal. For instance, tax being collected by LMC in 2019-20 is the amount due on households in 2018-19. LMC’s annual budget is passed in March every year, but projections are revised in October depending on revenue collection and grants from the government. For the past two years, LMC’s house tax collection has been dismal. In 2017-18, against the target of Rs 280 crore, the corporation collected around Rs 178 crore. In 2018-19, it collected just Rs 180 crore against the target of Rs 260 crore. As a result, it had to cut the budget for civic works in the both the years. In 2018-19, the revised budget presented in October slashed the amount allocated for sanitation works from Rs 100 crore to Rs 95 crore and cleaning of drains from Rs 10 crore to Rs 8.5 crore. The LMC also retrenched contractual sanitary workers by slashing the budget from Rs 75 crore to Rs 60 crore. The same could happen this year because tax collection pattern is same as 2017-18 and 2018-19. On both occasions, in first five months of the financial year, tax collection was only 40-45% and by the end of the fiscal it touched 70% of the target. However, LMC tax in charge Ashok Singh said. “The OTS scheme has been extended till August. We are hopeful of achieving the goal this year.” "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Road rage to full-blown clash on NH9,"GHAZIABAD: Police in Ghaziabad and Greater Noida have booked over 100 unidentified people from two communities for creating a ruckus on NH-9 and hurling abuses and casteist remarks at each other on Friday. The cops swung into action after a video clip of the ruckus went viral on social media. One person has been arrested, police said. The trouble between the two communities (Yadav and Gujjar) started on August 24 when a member of one community was thrashed in a road rage case. “Initially an argument broke out between Gautam Singh, a resident of Bamheta village in Ghaziabad, and Chirag Gujjar from Acheta village in Greater Noida, when their cars collided in Sihani gate area. First Gujjar called some of his friends and thrashed Gautam. Subsequently, Gautam and his friends hit back,” said Shlok Kumar, SP (city). Post the road rage, an FIR was registered at the Sihani Gate police station in Ghaziabad but the cops made no arrests “as the matter was reportedly settled by the two sides”. But of late, both the Yadavs and Gujjars began posting on social media sites that they were beaten up by the other side. The elders of both the villages called a panchayat in Dasna area to settle the matter. But the two communities clashed with each other at the panchayat on Friday. Later members of the two communities took out separate processions from Lal Kuan area in Ghaziabad till Greater Noida. Two separate FIRs have now been registered against over 100 people in Kavi Nagar police station in Ghaziabad and Badalpur police station in Greater Noida under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. “Suo motu action was taken as soon as the incident came to light on Friday, and we have lodged a case against 100 unknown men. We are trying to identify them from the video that is being circulated on social media platforms,” said Patnish Kumar, SHO of Badlapur police station. The SP (city) added: “We have arrested a person named Kapil, belonging to Bamheta village, after identifying him from the video circulated on social media platforms.” "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Smart City one-stop centre in sloth mode,"LUCKNOW: A single-window system for information, documentation and grievance redress, which was rolled out to citizens through the Smart City application a month ago, is yet to function in a full-fledged manner. Of the total eight services promised at this ‘command and control centre’ coordinated by Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), only three have been launched till date while the rest are expected to be on offer in a staggered manner by the end of October. Residents can currently report civic problems directly related to LMC such as poor garbage management or choked drains. The facility to register grievances about electricity, water and traffic management is still not available. They can seek birth and death certificates, but services like information on parking space and ATMs, assessment of property and income taxes (and complaints thereof), and issuance of caste certificates are pending. In the civic gripe section, more than 1,700 complaints on unattended garbage, stray animals and waterlogging, among others, have been lodged in a month. According to officials, 1,150 of these problems have been resolved within stipulated time. The others will be resolved before their respective deadlines too, the officials said. Complainants, on the other hand, have mixed reactions to the single-window system. Manav Jaiswal of Aishbagh said his complaint regarding a choked drain was addressed within six hours. “Earlier, the LMC used to take several days to act. In comparison, the problem was resolved in a jiffy this time. The centre even called to inform that the job had been done,” he added. Anurag Singh of Alambagh, who had filed a complaint about dirty water supply, is disappointed though. “My grievance has not been attended to. I have been told the service is yet to be integrated. Shouldn’t the authorities have launched the centre after integrating all the promised services?” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh said the private company hired to start and manage all the services was working on the Smart City application. “The delay has been caused by a technical snag in the app. All services will be started by the end of next month,” Singh added.

Lucknow,5% schoolkids in UP at risk of diabetes: Study,"LUCKNOW: Around 10% schoolchildren and adolescents in India and 5% in UP are at risk of diabetes, according to the first-ever national micro-nutrient survey conducted by the Union health ministry, the report of which was recently released. Titled Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey, the report also noted that 8.9% children in the 10-19 years age group in the state had increased blood pressure level against a national average of 4.9%. It also recorded high triglyceride level in 10% children both in the country and the state. Acknowledging the trend as a “growing threat”, the survey underscored the onset of “double burden of malnutrition” in a number of states. The term refers to the simultaneously existing twin challenge of under-nutrition (problems of underweight, stunting and wasting) and over-nutrition (overweight and obesity) that states need to tackle. The survey undertook a comprehensive nutritional assessment of over 1.12 lakh children in the 0-19 age group across 30 states, including UP. For this, two objectives were fixed. First, measure malnutrition in children and adolescents. Second, assess biomarkers of non-communicable diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol and kidney function. To draw conclusions, the research team that included experts from Unicef took blood samples of children and evaluated them against the prescribed standards. To measure the risk of diabetes, biomarker of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was picked. This test measures percentage of blood sugar attached to haemoglobin and is considered to be a robust test for long-term sugar management. On the count, samples of 5% children in UP in 5-9 years age group and 4% adolescents (10-19 years) were found in the “pre-diabetic” category. “Pre-diabetes is marked by high insulin resistance and speaks for unhealthy diet and lifestyle. Studies have shown that over 50% of those who fall in the pre-diabetic category eventually develop the disease,” Prof Narsingh Verma, president UP Diabetes Association, told TOI. Decoding the findings on high triglyceride level, vice-president of Cardiological Society of India and faculty member of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences professor Satyendra Tiwari said: “Triglyceride is a type of fat processed in the body. Its high level indicates that the body is consuming more calories than it can burn. A high triglyceride level is greatly associated with heart diseases, stroke and diabetes.” General manager (child health), National Health Mission UP, Dr Ved Prakash said the state government was working on a plan to address the double burden of malnutrition.

Lucknow,IIM Lucknow gurus give Yogi Adityanath &amp; team a blueprint for growth of UP,"LUCKNOW: When chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his cabinet colleagues went to IIM-Lucknow for the second time with state's senior bureaucrats in tow, the B-school management gurus laid out a roadmap for raising per capita income by increasing state gross domestic product (SGDP) through people's participation. The blueprint was drawn by IIM-L faculty during sessions on policy formulation, stakeholder expectations and accountability. The ministers and senior bureaucrats, who were divided into eight groups during sessions, were told to raise public participation by taking people's feedback and fill gaps to boost the state economy. Talking to TOI, cabinet minister and government spokesperson Srikant Sharma, said IIM-L professors emphasized on the need to build infrastructural facilities to increase SGDP and eventually consumer demand. The management gurus pointed out how the state lagged behind on per capital consumption of power - against a national average of 1100 units per month/per capita, UP consumed only 600 units. The basic idea is to turn the state into $1 trillion economy, Sharma said. A senior IAS officer who attended the eight-hour sessions told TOI that IIM professors deliberated upon implementation of policies that could boost infrastructure, especially in rural areas that account for 25% of the state GDP. ""If the infrastructure in rural areas is given a boost, then SGDP would go up as a whole,'' the official said. The official said that the management gurus laid stress upon building roads and providing more electricity to rural areas. This, he said, would give a fillip to rural development and eventually push GDP up. The faculty pointed out that irrigation facilities too need to be improved to enhance productivity of farmers and raise their produce. A transparent machinery should also be in place to purchase their produce, he said. The IIM faculty also stressed on industrialization to increase job opportunities in the state and thereby increase the per capital income of the people in the state. "

Lucknow,Seven Asiatic lions from Gujarat to roar in Yogi’s den,"LUCKNOW:Seven Asiatic lions from Gujarat will roar in UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s backyard on September 26. Gifted by his Gujarat counterpart, Vijay Rupani, it was Yogi’s dream to usher the royal guests to Gorakhpur zoo. The initial plan was to bring eight lions from Junagadh zoo, but a female among the species was found medically unfit. In 2014, the issue triggered a flare-up between then UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and BJP’s PM-candidate Narendra Modi, when Samajwadi Party government brought lions for Etawah lion safari. However, five years down the line, it was a quiet advent of lions, five of whom are females. Sources said, the Gujarat government has agreed to part with the lions without seeking animals in exchange. Till Gorakhpur zoo is ready, lions will be lodged at Etawah safari, thus promising hope for Yadav’s safari project as well. It’s after three-and-half years that lions are being brought to UP from Gujarat. Of the 10 lions brought from Gujarat under CZA-approved animal exchange programme for the Yadav’s ambitious Etawah lion safari project between 2013 and 2015, five died of canine distemper virus (CDV) and the government drew criticism. Five cubs born to different lion pairs also died, though not of CDV. The Etawah safari was later sanitized against the contagion with a vaccine provided by San Diego zoo, US, and is now safe. The UP government, to be doubly sure of lions’ health, got the thorough medical check-up of the felines at their native zoo. Two veterinarians from UP sent to Gujarat had checked each of the eight lions. After a female was found unfit, the government decided to bring seven.“Each lion has a chip embedded in its tail and carries a unique identity,” said V K Singh, director, Etawah lion safari. Though the Gujarat government handed over custody of the lions to UP on June 11, the Yogi government waited for conducive weather to bring the big cats. The fact that Gorakhpur zoo can house only three lions might make the state government decide to house the remaining big cats at Etawah safari, which is yet to attain minimum number of 10 cubs and has only one lioness, Jessica, as a potential breeder. The safari, at present, has six cubs which were born to Jessica since 2016. "
Lucknow,"Saadatganj horror: Dad’s aide raped, killed 6-year-old","LUCKNOW: The accused in the Saadatanj murder case on Monday confessed he had raped the 6-year-old girl before killing her by slitting her throat. More than 500 residents of the area participated in the last rites of the girl and demanded death penalty for the accused. ASP (west) Vikas Chandra Tripathi said the accused, Mohammad Arafat, had confessed that he had raped the minor after which he strangulated her and slit her throat. The postmortem examination report states that there were multiple injuries on the body of the child, including on her private parts. The knife with which Arafat had slit the throat was also recovered from his house. A daily wager, Arafat (30), used to work with the girl’s father. He met the family everyday. He is married and has two daughters—aged 1.5 years and 6 months. His family was away because he was a drunkard. On Sunday, Arafat had taken the girl home when she was playing alone outside her home. The bloodied body of the girl was found under the bed in Arafat’s room. Her parents had lodged a missing complaint with the police. On grounds of suspicion, Arafat was detained and his house searched. “We have sent the clothes of the girl and samples of fluids found in her body along with blood sample of the accused to the forensic science lab for matching of DNA. If matched, this will be conclusive evidence of rape,” Tripathi said. The heinous crime led to angry protests from the people of the area who pelted stones at Arafat’s house. Heavy police force was deployed till the burial took place. The 30-year-old father of the minor, with tearful eyes, told TOI, “I had no dispute with Arafat. We knew him for many years. I could never have imagined that he would rape and kill my daughter.” Mohammad Zeshan, another resident, said, “This incident will bring suspicion in the minds of people about their neighbours in trusting them with their children.” Shoaib, a father of two girls, said, “We had only read of such stories in newspapers but never thought it will happen among us. If our daughters are not safe from people coming into our house then what will happen to them when they will go outside.” Many among the 500 residents of the locality took off from work or shut their shops to join the mourning. Mohammad Farhan, a senior citizen, said, “It all happened under the influence of alcohol. The administration must set an example for expediting the trial process so that the accused gets severe punishment.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)"

Kanpur,Yogi Adityanath hints at phased rollout of NRC in Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW/KANPUR: A day after Haryana chief minister M L Khattar spoke about launching a National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise in his state, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday suggested a similar exercise would be implemented in UP as well and it would be rolled out in phases. Yogi expressed his intent twice on Monday during his whistle-stop tour of Kanpur and Mau. The CM reiterated that infiltrators were being driven out of the country in reference to the NRC exercise in Assam. ""Each and every illegal immigrant in the country will be deported. In 2022, India will be free of poverty, terrorism, Naxalism, anarchy and disorder,"" he said. A day earlier, the CM raised this issue for the first time in an interview with a daily. He had said: ""The NRC exercise is being implemented phase-wise and when Uttar Pradesh will need an NRC, we will kick-start the process. In the first phase, it was Assam and the way it is being implemented there, it can be a model to follow. Using their experience, we can start it phase-wise here. It's important for national security and this will stop snatching away of rights of poor by illegal immigrants."" ‘CM will be first to become outsider’Government sources, however, remained tightlipped on such move, but BJP said it would be a welcome move. UP government spokesperson and MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said, “The CM has said if required, it can be rolled out in phases and Assam model was good. Beyond this statement, nothing further has been discussed.” However, Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh said, “NRC will be implemented 100%.” Without setting a timeline, he said, “Home minister Amit Shah said NRC should be implemented in the entire country and this will be taken up in UP too. I think it’s a very good idea to weed out illegal immigrants,” he said.

Lucknow,Lucknow civic body to double house tax to stave off funds crunch,"LUCKNOW: Reeling under acute financial crisis, Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) has proposed steep hike of house tax from the financial year 2020-21 to increase its revenue. Incidentally, the financial crunch is mainly because of poor house tax collection over the past three years. However, instead of improving collection, LMC has chosen to raise taxes, inviting angry reactions from the people. The last time house tax was increased was in 2010-11. According to rules, house tax can be revised every 10 years. The limit can be longer if financial condition of the municipal body is healthy. TimesViewRather than increasing house tax to generate more revenue, LMC should first work on improving tax collection. Tax hike will burden those who have been honestly paying their dues on time. Losses to the civic body are mainly because of defaulters who should be fined or face legal action.LMC, however, has used the opportunity to propose a tax hike to meet the cash crunch and meet the requirement of development in the city. The proposal has been approved by its executive committee and the mayor and sent to the urban development department for approval. “We need to improve our revenue to meet the demand of development in the city, hence tax hike proposal has been approved and sent to government for its stamp,” said LMC chief tax in charge Ashok Singh. LMC has not been able to achieve its target of collecting Rs 260 crore as house tax from 5.48 lakh houses in the city for the past three years. In 2017-18, it collected Rs 178 crore, in 2018-19 Rs 174 crore and 2019-20 around Rs 134 crore so far. When asked why LMC was not working to improve tax collection, Singh said that the civic body had tried several things from simplifying tax payment and online assessment to one-time settlement schemes, but still has not been able to achieve the target.

Lucknow,"Lucknowite completes 1,200 kms Paris-Brest-Paris cycling event","It's like a dream come true for Lucknowite Abhinav Kumar Singh, who participated in a 1200 km cycling event Paris-Brest-Paris (PBP) Randonneur and completed it in 92hours. Of the total of about 7000 participants, only 350 odd participants attempted the challenge from India of which 25 were women. Among the 10 riders from UP, only Abhinav from the city and Manish Mishra from Prayagraj could complete one of the most challenging cycling events in the world. PBP first started in the year 1891 and is the world’s oldest ultra-cycling event which is now organised every four years. Being the first international cycling medal for him, despite having pedalled 6000+ kms through the country as part of official Brevets organized by various clubs across India, Abhinav also holds a Super Randonneur (SR) title which is achieved by completing a series of 200, 300, 400 &amp; 600 kms rides in a Brevet year, a prerequisite for participating in PBP. Abhinav Kumar Singh (BCCL) Abhinav Kumar Singh (BCCL) This electronics engineer is also a mountaineer, skier, scuba diver, marathoner and ultra-cyclist and in fact, Abhinav calls himself an endurance athlete at heart. ""I love long distances, be it running, hiking or cycling. I have participated in more than 10 editions of Mumbai Marathon, half and full besides Leh Marathon, Bengaluru, and Delhi Marathons,"" he says. So ask Abhinav, who also holds an Advanced Search &amp; Rescue certification in mountaineering from NIM Uttarkashi and Advanced Skiing certification from IISM, Gulmarg, how cycling became his passion and he replies, ""As a child I loved cycling and detested travelling in the school bus so I would always commute to school on a cycle in Raebareli and Dehradun from where my schooling happened. I would cycle to school, to tuition and even for fun and exploration. In a way it gave me wings. Thereafter during my higher studies in Bengaluru, I would often use a cycle to commute. Pune and Bengaluru are top cycling cities of India and the culture helped."" To promote cycling and sustainable commute in UP and specifically in Lucknow, in 2017, Singh launched Lucknow Randonneurs (LR), a non-profit organization in affiliation with AudaxIndia Randonneurs (AIR), India and Audax Club Parisen (ACP), Paris which authorizes them to conduct long-distance cycling events in Lucknow ranging from 200 to 1200 kms under its aegis. Sharing his feelings on achieving this feat, Singh says, ""I felt on the top of the world upon arrival at the finish point at Rambouillet and to become a part of an elite and accomplished community of finishers who have achieved this task; ‘PBP Anciens’! I was overwhelmed and felt vindicated for all those who supported me in this effort. It was only later that I got to know that I am the only person ever to finish the ride from Lucknow and UP with the exception of NCR region.” He adds, “PBP is one of the most gruelling and toughest self-supported ultra-cycling events in the world. It’s not for the weak-hearted, every moment is an effort. Be it the bone-chilling cold and rain, the sizzling heat, sleepless hallucinating nights, the body aches or the saddle sores, one has to just overcome these and keep riding. I am thankful to god for helping me in completing it!"" Sharing his success mantra, Abhinav says, ""Pain was my constant companion during the ride. Somehow my left knee pain flared up around 610 km at Brest when I had another 610km to go and it did get worse, accompanying me till the very end. I could just have given in or gotten above it. But I persisted and while the pain grew so did my willpower to overcome it. Mind over matter! My favourite quote is from Rocky Balboa""It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward."" "

The uncle pulled out the girl and his wife locked Monu, before raising an alarm. This triggered mob mobilization outside the house,” said Priyadarshi.

However, Monu’s uncle stated in the FIR the mob attack was a fallout of a property dispute. The accused have been booked under the SC/ST Act and murder. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow civic body tax collectors called child lifters, forced to run","LUCKNOW: Collecting tax dues from home-owners in Lucknow is not an easy task, officials are learning the hard way. A team of Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) which had gone to serve a legal notice to a Gomtinagar house owner for paying undervalued house tax was called a ‘child lifter’ gang and chased away by the residents. In another house, a woman thundered, “If you will come here again, I will unleash my dog on you.” These are two examples of several incidents of threats and humiliation that LMC teams have had to face while serving legal notices to residents who have been caught paying undervalued house tax. These residents of Gomtinagar and Gomtinagar Extension had submitted wrong self-assessment of their house tax. A total of 1.5 lakh houses/commercial units out of 5.48 lakh in the city are paying undervalued house tax resulting in Rs 20 crore loss over four years. These were shortlisted by LMC based on a survey conducted through Geographical Information System. Now, legal notices are being served to the house-owners asking them to pay the dues within 15 days. If they fail to do so, the construction work done by them in excess of floor area in use declared will be demolished. The process of serving notices began with Gomtinagar on Monday where around 7,000 units were found to be evading tax. While many took the notices, at several places, LMC teams had to face hostility. In Vishal Khand, a middle-aged woman threatened the LMC team by saying that she would lodge an FIR against the team members for harassing her. “In Viram Khand, we saw a boy playing in the lawn and asked him to call his parents. A woman came out and heard us but refused to take the notice and threatened to call the police, accusing us of being child-lifters,” recalled a team member. In Vivek Khand, on being told about the notice, the resident, a clerk at an auto service centre, called his neighbours and accused employees of misbehaviour. “The crowd threatened LMC staff with sticks and asked them to leave to avoid being beaten up,” a team member told TOI. Zonal officials of zone-4, which includes Gomtinagar and Gomtinagar Extension, have threatened to boycott work if they do not get police force to accompany them on these drives. Additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh said, “We will re-visit houses where people have misbehaved with our officials. This time, we will take police officials as well.” "

Lucknow,Saadatganj horror: Minor raped for revenge on father,"LUCKNOW: It was revenge that led to the rape and brutal murder of the six-year-old girl in Saadatganj on Sunday by an acquaintance of her own father. The accused, Arafat, wanted to take revenge on the child’s father because he held him responsible for his separation from his wife, claimed police on Tuesday based on the confessional statement of the accused. “Arafat allegedly strangulated the girl after rape as he feared that she would tell her parents. He was not sure that she had died, hence he slit her throat with a kitchen knife. He hid the body below the bed and had planned to dispose it in the night,” said Saadatganj SHO Mahesh Pal Singh. Arafat, who lives in a single-room rented house a few blocks away from the house of the victim, told police that he had been working with the victim’s father for the past nine years. A distant relative of the victim’s father was also with them. The girl used to call Arafat ‘mama’ because her mother used to treat the accused as a brother. Arafat’s wife was also a distant relative of the girl’s mother. According to the SHO, Arafat told police that the victim’s father had started visiting his wife frequently when she was in hospital in May for the delivery of their second daughter. A month later, she left Arafat and went to her maternal house. “Arafat believed his wife and the girl’s father were having an affair and that made his wife leave. He did not speak of it to anyone and planned revenge,” the SHO said. Relatives and neighbours told police that Arafat’s wife left because he used to beat her regularly after getting drunk. On Sunday, a drunk Arafat went to the victim’s house around 4pm when she was with her grandmother. He lured her to come with him to his house, where he sexually assaulted and killed her. Later, Arafat even joined the victim’s father in search of her. When the girl’s grandmother revealed that Arafat had come to the house in the afternoon, he slipped away. This raised suspicion in the mind of the victim’s father who then with the help of police raided Arafat’s house and found the body, officer added. ASP west Vikas Chandra Tripathi said, “We are trying our best for quick justice in the case by filing a chargesheet within a week in the fast-track court.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)"
Lucknow,"Lucknow: OPD services crippled as staff, doctors clash at RML hospital","LUCKNOW: Patients had a harrowing time as healthcare services remained paralysed for more than two hours at RML Institute of Medical Sciences after five people were injured in a clash between ad hoc employees and MBBS students on Tuesday. A three-member committee has been formed to probe the matter. The incident occurred around 9.30am, when an MBBS student was standing in a queue at outpatient window for registration of a cancer patient. The student jumped the line and asked an ad hoc employee at the counter to first register his relative. A verbal spat ensued after he was denied out-of-turn registration. This soon snowballed into fisticuffs. Both the sides called their associates and soon there was free for all between ad hoc employees and MBBS students for about 30 minutes, leaving five injured - three employees and two students. Security guards intervened and pacified both the parties, which took the matter to RMLIMS director Prof A K Tripathi. After hearing the two sides, Tripathi ordered a probe headed by Prof Nuzhat Hussain. The committee has been asked to submit the report in three days. Chaos and confusion prevailed in the hospital after the clash. Many patients who had come for consultation at OPD had to go back disappointed as registration remained suspended for over two hours. Rakesh, who brought his injured brother Ghanshyam to RML from Balrampur Hospital, said, ""All employees went out as I reached the registration counter, saying they will not work in protest. I went to another counter, but no one turned up for at least one and a half hours."" Similar trauma was faced by Jagdeesh Prasad (60), a prostate cancer patient. Tripathi agreed that the registration process stopped, but claimed that doctors kept working all the while. ""All the students found guilty of creating a ruckus will be suspended and employees will be sacked,"" he said. "
Lucknow,Coveted feat for toppers with heart of gold in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: Durgesh Kumar Tripathi, who earned laurels for volunteer-based slum education programme, and Vibhu Banerjee, who spearheaded an awareness campaign on sanitary pads among girls in slum areas, were on Tuesday selected for coveted Chancellor and Chakravarti gold medals of the Lucknow University. These two medals are different from others as these are given to best students among all faculties for their extra-curricular activities, social work as well as academics. As many as 28 students appeared for interviews for Chancellor medal and 26 for Chakravarti medal. The last date of filing objections against these selections is September 26. According to LU officials, Durgesh, topper in MA (defence studies), was chosen for Chancellor’s medal because of his outstanding performance in studies and extra-curricular activities. He has won awards in debate competitions and was the third best NCC cadet in Republic Day parade in 2012. He has also participated in national-level rifle shooting competitions but the educational programme that he conducted in slum areas gave him an edge over other students. “Two years ago, I formed a group of 150 students each in LU’s old and second campus. The volunteers went to slum areas to impart basic education to children. The campaign started with just two students,” said Durgesh who wants to be an IAS officer. He was part of India’s youth exchange programme with Bhutan in 2012. Durgesh’s father is an ex-serviceman and his mother is a homemaker. Vibhu, an LLB student, is also a part of Durgesh’s slum education programme. This year, he also launched a campaign with the help of 50 girl students to educate slum dwellers about menstrual hygiene. Later, with the assistance of a few NGOs, he distributed sanitary pads in slum areas. Vibhu won the best speaker award twice at Model United Nation’s conference at Banaras Hindu University in 2016 and a private university in Lucknow in 2019. His mother is an associate professor at Navyug Girls’ Degree College and his father is a retired teacher. He wants to pursue career in academics. "

Lucknow,BJP to strengthen grassroots cadre in Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW: BJP on Wednesday began churning grassroots cadre by kicking off organisational elections for creating a new army of foot soldiers to steer the party in the run-up to bypolls in 13 seats and subsequently in 2022 assembly elections. The party went into a four-day election mode from Wednesday and the process would continue till September 22 to elect cadre at the booth-level. State BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said, BJP trampled upon the Opposition during 2014 and 2019 general elections and state elections of 2017 by strengthening its booths. Talking to TOI, he said, “We will elect grassroots functionaries at more than 1.60 lakh booths. The drive, importantly, coincides with completion of 2.5 years of BJP rule in the state.” Sources said, though elections of primary members are continuing since September 11, the party chose to focus on four days in the run-up to Hamirpur bypoll, where elections are due on September 23. BJP’s move to kick off organisational elections comes amid a changed political situation with SP and BSP snapping ties and Congress flexing its muscle to take on the saffron party. These elections have essentially been delayed by a year. They were scheduled to be held in 2018, but were put on hold on account of 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: 4 years after murder, cops to recreate crime scene","LUCKNOW: More than four years after the incident, police will recreate the sequence of events in the mysterious murder of La Martiniere College student Rahul Sridhar. Lucknow police has taken the step because the Supreme Court ordered it in the hearing of the case on September 16. It has sought a detailed report about the case in its next hearing on October 18. SC took up the issue based on a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the victim’s brother Rohit Sridhar in 2017.

Ghaziabad,Transport strike: Many schools in Delhi-NCR shut today,"GURUGRAM: Some schools in Delhi-NCR will remain shut on Thursday, with transporters in the region deciding to join the strike called by unions in protest against the hefty fines under the new motor vehicles act. And those that will remain open have asked parents to pick up and drop their wards to school. In Noida and Ghaziabad, a number of schools have deferred their half-yearly examinations, with the school bus operators joining the strike. School authorities said they took the decision on their own ""in the interest of the safety of students"" though there has been no such direction from the district administration. Nishant Sharma, director of Noida's Vidya Bal Bhawan, said, ""When it comes to the safety of students, we can't take any risk. So, we've decided to remain shut on Thursday.""  ""We have also declared a holiday, pre-empting the inconvenience of parents,"" a spokesperson for Shiv Nadar School said. Similarly, DPS Noida confirmed, ""Our school is closed for students on Thursday."" Amity International School too has shut the school for students on Thursday. In Ghaziabad, DPS Indirapuram said they had sent out SMSes to parents, informing them of the holiday. ""We had an exam scheduled for Thursday, but we decided to defer it to Friday as our school will remain closed due to transport strike,"" said Priya John, the school's vice principal.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: BCA student held for plot to kidnap cousin, extort money","GHAZIABAD: A 20-year-old BCA student attempting to extort money from his uncle was arrested on Tuesday after police tracked down his SIM, which he had bought using his own name. Two others, his friends, were also arrested as accomplices. On Monday, Deepak Singh Manral, a finance manager with a Noida-based real estate firm, got WhatsApp messages and calls threatening to kidnap his son, Vansh, if he did not come to Kanawani and pay Rs 5 lakh. Manral rushed to his son’s school, Amity International, at Vasundhara and, to his relief, found him there. He filed a complaint at the Indirapuram police station. “While investigating, we found that the SIM had been bought by Shivam Parihar hours before the ransom messages were sent. He was detained and, during interrogation, he confessed to the crime and told us about the role his friends played,” SP (city) Shlok Kumar said. Shivam is Vansh’s cousin. “I was shocked to find out that my nephew was behind the conspiracy. He came to my house after I filed a police complaint to ask about any developments in the case. He stayed with us all through and expressed his concern. I could not imagine he would do such a thing,” Manral told TOI. He is a second year BCA student at the Institute of Technology and Science. Shivansh Bhagat (20) is a second year BTech student at SRM University, Sonepat and Avneesh Garg (19) is a Class XII student. All three accused are from well-to-do families – Shivam’s father is a stockbroker and Shivansh’s father is a businessman – and needed the money to “maintain their lavish lifestyle”, the SP added. Police said the money would be divided among the three in proportion to their role – Shivam came up with the plan and would take Rs 3.5 lakh, Shivansh made the calls and sent the messages and would get Rs 1 lakh, and Avneesh would get Rs 50,000 for collecting the money at Kanawani. “They even had a Plan B in place. If they failed to extort money from Manral, they would kidnap Shivam’s friend from college, Gaurav, whose father is a businessman,” the SP added. An FIR was filed against unidentified persons under Section 386 (extortion) under the IPC at the Indirapuram police station on Monday. "
Ghaziabad,Footbridge across NH-9 to give Ghaziabad access to Blue Line in Noida,"GHAZIABAD: The Electronic City station on the Blue Line is just across the road from Indirapuram but reaching it is quite another story. Since the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (an upgrade of NH9) is under construction, one cannot walk. Autos are reluctant to go because, though it’s a 2-minute ride, it means going to a different district and needing permits for it. The only reliable options, then, are e-rickshaws or app-based cabs, which are expensive. This will change from December. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will take up the construction of a foot overbridge (FOB) across NH9 to connect Noida’s Sector 62 with Indirapuram. The FOB plan has a provision to connect it with the Electronic City station which, according to NHAI officials, will have to be built by Delhi Metro.

We plan to start the work in October,” said RP Singh, project director, NHAI. “The FOB on the Noida side will start at the Sector 62 roundabout and on the Ghaziabad side, it will be at a distance of 200m from the CISF road. In future, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) may connect the FOB with a 100m skywalk from the metro station, as this will give metro commuters direct access to Indirapuram area,” said Singh. The footbridge will be 82m long and 2.5m wide. “It will also be equipped with lifts on both sides. Each lift will be able to accommodate 16 people at a time,” Singh said. It is the first of three FOBs, between UP Gate and Dasna, that the NHAI has started work on. The other two are planned at Chajarsi and near Columbia Asia hospital. Officials said one of the challenges that the NHAI faced while designing the FOB was leaving ample space for the Noida Electronic City-Mohan Nagar metro extension. “A metro pillar for the corridor has already been erected on the DME-NH9 alignment, which will be 50m from the FOB,” said Singh. While Electronic City is now the terminal station on the Blue Line, Mohan Nagar in Ghaziabad is part of the Red Line. Official said the NHAI has also planned bus services between Noida and Ghaziabad and for that it will construct 32 bus shelters on both sides of DME and NH9. “The shelters have been planned near Khoda, Sai temple, Kala Patthar Model Town, CISF Chajarsi, Rahul Vihar and AKG Engineering college,” said Mudit Garg, deputy general manager, NHAI. About random three-wheeler movement on both sides of DME, Garg said he has written to the district magistrates of Noida and Ghaziabad. “We will allow only limited three-wheelers on the highway and we have suggested colour coding of three-wheelers. Only colour coded vehicles would be allowed to ferry commuters on both sides,” said Garg. The NHAI has also asked the two DMs to ensure three-wheeler parking is at a distance of 100m from the DME. "

The murder came to light late Wednesday after police spurred by Allahabad High Court directive launched a search operation to trace the woman, Rekha, who went missing from Gauranpurwa village in Kannauj. The court ordered Kannauj police to produce her, following a habeas corpus petition filed by the girl’s lover, Amit Yadav, of adjoining Dhaurara village. Couple had kept marriage a secretIn his petition, Amit alleged Rekha was untraceable after he last met her on May 4, 2019. He informed court that they were in love and had tied the knot at an Arya Samaj temple in Etah, but kept the marriage secret as her family was opposed to it.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Brace for double house tax after power tariff hike,"LUCKNOW: After a power tariff hike, get ready to cough up almost double your property tax — 71-120% hike — on housing and commercial units from the next fiscal. The proposal to raise tax slabs was approved by Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) on Thursday and forwarded to the state government for a formal nod. The hike rate is less (71%) for those with houses on the main road with 24m width and above in posh localities, whereas the increase is more (around 120%) for those living in interior areas and Old City with road width below 24m. The bulk of population lives in the areas in the second category. Shocker: Upto 120% hike in house taxSample this: The tax rate of houses on roads having breadth of 24m has been increased from Rs 1.75 sqm to Rs 3 sqm. The tax slab for an owner of a middle-income group house of 80 sqm will increase by 71% from Rs 1,680 annually to Rs 2,880. On the other hand, houses on roads with less than 24m breadth, the tax rate will rise from Rs 1.25sqm to Rs 2.75 sqm. This means the tax for owner of a middle-income group house of 80 sqm house will increase by 120% from Rs 1,200 per annum to Rs 2,640. While the civic body has justified the hike, saying it is being done after 10 years to meet revenue targets and for development of the city, residents are criticising LMC for passing on the burden of its failure to realise Rs 110 crore from 1.68 lakh defaulters. According to rules, property tax can be increased every 10 years. The last time housing tax was jacked up in Lucknow was in 2010-11. The quantum of hike depends on the financial status of the municipal body. In past few years, LMC has failed to achieve its annual tax collection target of Rs 260 crore from 5.48 lakh households. In 2017-18, it raised Rs 178 crore; in 2018-19, Rs 174 crore was collected; and so far in 2019-20, around Rs 140 crore has reached the LMC kitty. “We have cleared the fresh hike proposal, which will now be approved by the urban development department for implementation,” said municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi. Citizens, however, insisted that the LMC should first try recovering dues from defaulters. “The civic authorities have not come up with any measure to deal with defaulters. If the LMC’s revenue generation is less, it is because of its own failure to realise dues from defaulters. Why are honest taxpayers being punished?” said Akshara Asthana of Munshipulia. Residents pointed out that defaulters received benefits, like discounts or waivers, while those who deposited their tax on time got nothing. Some taxpayers also said that they would happily pay a higher amount provided the LMC improved its services. “The garbage bin installed in front of my house is overflowing for the past two days. No LMC worker has come to clear the trash. My complaints have gone unheeded too. I pay my taxes regularly and this is not what I expect,” said Yash Srivastava of Alambagh. "

Before increasing power rates, the quality of power supply also needs to be improved in the city,” he further said. The Sikh community later burnt the copies of the electricity bill.

Lucknow,"Youth shoots woman, self after quarrel in Hasanganj","LUCKNOW: A man shot dead a woman before pulling the trigger on himself following an argument at her rented home in Hasanganj on Friday. The murder and suicide may be the fallout of a love affair gone awry, say cops. Preliminary investigation suggests health worker Bandana Chaudhary (24) and scrap dealer Madanlal Nishad (26), natives of Basti district, knew each other for the past few years. While Bandana worked at a private hospital in the city and lived in a rented accommodation in Daliganj with her sister, Madanlal worked in Pune. He had returned home a month ago for his mother’s treatment and left Basti on Wednesday. Hasanganj SHO Dhirendra Kumar Kushwaha quoted witnesses to say the incident took place around 10.45am. “Bandana returned home around 10am after a night shift. Madanlal stopped by half an hour later. They had an argument for some 15 minutes before the two shots were fired,” the SHO said.

Lucknow,"Inscriptions on Babri entrance counter temple claims, SC told","NEW DELHI: Muslim parties on Monday told the Supreme Court that Persian and Arabic inscriptions at the entrance of Babri Masjid at Ayodhya, studied in detail by experts prior to its demolition in December 1992, deflates expansive argument of Hindu parties that it was never a mosque as Hindus worshipped at the disputed site from time immemorial. Appearing for Muslim parties including Sunni Wakf Board before a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan said the inscriptions also take one to irrefutable conclusion that it was built in 1528 on the orders of Mughal emperor Babur. He said two judges of the Allahabad high court, in their 2010 verdict, had disbelieved the fact that the mosque was built on orders of Babur in 1528 “merely because of minor discrepancies in the interpretation of the inscriptions” and felt that there was a strong possibility of it being built by Aurangzeb in the 17th century. Recounting an earlier question from the bench whether there existed any mosque with Sanskrit inscription, Dhavan said though he has not come across any such mosque personally, but there is definite information that such a mosque exists in Jaunpur. This was to counter the arguments of Hindu parties that since the rubble of demolished disputed structure had Sanskrit inscriptions, it could not have been a mosque.

Lucknow,"In a first, Uttar Pradesh government schools to have parent-teacher meets","LUCKNOW: Usually confined to private schools, the concept of parent-teacher meetings (PTMs) is now being implemented in government schools for the first time in Uttar Pradesh. In another first, there will now be an annual day in all government schools. Additional chief secretary, basic education, Renuka Kumar told TOI, “Mandatory PTMs in government schools will go a long way in a healthy involvement of parents in the administration of schools, especially in ensuring that their wards get quality education.” PTMs, as per the government’s directions, will be held on the first Monday of every month. Officials said the objective to start PTMs in government schools is to apprise parents of the strengths and weaknesses of their wards. The PTMs will be monitored by additional BSAs and district task force teams. “We are working hard to improve the learning outcomes of students. But if students do not attend school and are working in the fields, the purpose will be defeated,” said V K Anand, state project director, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. He said even though parents come intermittently, they will get a chance to review the facilities in government schools.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Polluted air behind 40% COPD cases, says KGMU","LUCKNOW: Air pollution accounts for 40% cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among patients visiting King George’s Medical University (KGMU), a study by its pulmonary medicine department has revealed. The cause is second to smoking. The study, conducted by head of department professor Surya Kant, covered 360 patients over a period of three years from 2016. “As many as 216 were found to have acquired COPD because of smoking while the remaining 144 non-smokers were exposed to pollutants in the air,” said the professor whose paper was recently published in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care. COPD is an umbrella term used to describe progressive lung diseases, including emphysema, chronic bronchitis and refractory (non-reversible) asthma. It is characterised by increasing breathlessness. Symptoms may include chronic cough with sputum, swelling in legs, weight loss and loss of appetite. The survey also showed that those smoking regularly for 8-10 years developed COPD at the age of 60-70 years whereas most non-smokers were affected by the age of 51-60 years. In other words, non-smokers pay for pollutants in the air. Among COPD patients addicted to smoking, 75% were men and 25% women. The fair sex also constitutes 70% of non-smokers. This, the professor said, showed that women were susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution. According to the Air Quality Index of the Central Pollution Control Board, people in Lucknow got to breathe “good air” only for two days in 2018 and 17 days in 2017. Air quality is “good” when AQI is 60 and it is satisfactory between 60-100. Studies in the past have already revealed that in addition to vehicular emission, dust particles because of construction work and bad roads were behind air pollution in the city. Professor Surya Kant said the study further indicated that bad quality of air, which we experience in the open, was now inside our homes too. He said in urban slums and rural areas, women are falling prey to pollution caused by wood/charcoal cooking. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Dead Coast Guard officer’s hubby booked for polygamy,"LUCKNOW: A case of polygamy has been lodged at PGI police station against Arvind Singh, husband of Indian Coast Guard combat pilot and its former deputy commandant Sneha Kathayat who died under mysterious circumstances in July. Complainant Manoj Singh, in an FIR lodged earlier this week, has accused Arvind of marrying Sneha without divorcing his first wife Shikha. Manoj, who is Shikha’s father and a resident of Allahabad, said they came to know about Arvind’s second marriage only a fortnight ago. The FIR adds a fresh dimension to the Sneha Kathayat death case, which police had already closed as a suicide that followed an allegedly petty disagreement between husband and wife. Speaking to TOI, Manoj said his daughter Shikha’s wedding with Arvind, a commercial airline pilot, took place on November 24, 2013, as per Hindu rituals. The couple also has a four-year-old daughter. “Arvind tormented Shikha for dowry despite we giving him Rs 50 lakh cash and an SUV for wedding. We lodged a dowry harassment case against Arvind and his family members at Civil Lines police station in Allahabad in April 2015. A chargesheet has been filed in the case and trial is underway. Arvind filed a divorce plea in the principal family court in 2017. A decision is still pending,” Manoj said. The father said he learnt about Arvind’s second marriage while visiting Shikha who now stays with a relative in Delhi. “She had read about Sneha’s unfortunate death in newspapers. Arvind’s name was mentioned there. We probed further and found he had indeed married Sneha on May 30 this year,” he said, adding that he filed a polygamy complaint with police on September 17. Suspicious about how the Coast Guard officer might have died, Manoj had also sought from police Sneha’s postmortem report, but was denied the same. “I have now filed an RTI in this regard,” he said. PGI station house officer Ashok Saroj confirmed that a polygamy and criminal conspiracy case had been registered against Arvind, his parents, brother and sister-in-law. “Investigations have begun in the case. We will soon summon Arvind for a statement,” the SHO said. "

This translates to 125 crore bottles of ten such brands that were sold annually in 2018-19 financial year. Some of these brands are manufactured by UP’s liquor barons who also own sugar mills.

Although over the years UP annually generated more than Rs 10,000-15,000 crore annually from taxes on liquor, the excise revenue collection reported for 2018-19 was Rs 23,918 crore.

Of 11 seats that will go to poll, three were represented by Yogi’s ministers Rita Bahuguna Joshi, S P Baghel and Satyadev Pachauri. However, bypoll in Tundla represented by Baghel has been put in abeyance by Election Commission as his Scheduled Caste certificate has been challenged in Supreme Court after his election from Agra (reserved) parliamentary seat. The bypoll will be particularly interesting in Rampur City, where Azam Khan has been put on a leash by the Yogi government with 85 cases slapped against him and kin from buffalo and goat thefts to being declared a land mafia. The Assembly seat fell vacant after Khan defeated BJP’s Bollywood star-turned politician Jaya Prada in a high-profile parliamentary election. After pushing Azam to the wall, BJP would battle to wrest this seat. Similarly, BSP held sway over Jalalpur in Ambedkar Nagar district. Sitting MLA Ritesh Pandey was elected to Parliament from Akbarpur and Mayawati would like to retain this seat, though Ritesh’s father and BSP strongman Rama Kant Pandey has refused to contest from here. This would be the second seat where ruling BJP would want to dislodge Opposition to send a strong message that it has uprooted rivals from UP’s political landscape and its road to 2022 is smooth. BJP has held remaining nine assembly seats that will go to polls next month and the ruling party would battle to retain then.

Another big handicap of the Opposition after its debilitating loss in 2019 is its lack of appetite to win. The mood in Hamirpur, where bypolls are scheduled on Monday, is also an indicator. While BJP has deployed its full might with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and state president Swatantradev Singh leading the campaign, no top leaders of SP or BSP has found time to seek votes for their candidates. The Hamirpur seat fell vacant after its representative Ashok Chandel was convicted by Allahabad High Court in a 22-year-old shootout in which five people were killed. Not only Hamirpur, but in all other 11 seats going to poll, BJP has displayed a sense of urgency by assigning a minister and a senior leader as in charge of elections, but SP, BSP and Congress are doing a perfunctory job by limiting themselves to press statements and tweets.

Estate department officials confirmed Yadav’s vehicle has developed some snag and the estimated cost of its repair is Rs 26 lakh which is too much for the exchequer.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Not just this weekend, rest of the month to soak in rain too","LUCKNOW: Moderate rain lashed the city again after a day’s gap on Saturday, keeping the weather pleasant. The state Met department predicted that the cycle of sultry weather and intermittent rain will continue next week as well. Lucknow residents woke up to an overcast sky and the downpour lasted for about two hours, starting around 11am. The heavy rain was followed by an intermittent drizzle till about 2pm.

Even when the rain stopped, a cloud cover and soothing winds kept the weather pleasant despite the humidity. The relative humidity oscillated between 83% and 95%. State Met director JP Gupta said a low pressure area had developed locally due to the heat and heavy moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal. The low pressure area was responsible for the rainfall in some parts of the state on Saturday morning.

Ghaziabad,Farmers end protest after Centre accepts 5 demands,"GHAZIABAD: Hundreds of farmers who laid siege at the UP-Delhi border after their march to the national capital was stopped by police ended their protest on Saturday. This was after the Union government agreed to five of their 15 demands, the farmers’ organisation leading the protest announced. The farmers, who had started their march from Saharanpur on September 11 under the banner of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangathan (BKS), had been demanding pending sugarcane dues, loan waivers, reduced power tariff, free school education for their children, and implementation of the Swaminathan Committee’s report, among others. Rajendra Yadav, UP president of BKS, told the media that he and 10 other organisation representatives met the joint secretary of the agriculture ministry in Delhi, Vivek Aggarwal, in the afternoon after getting a call from the bureaucrat around 12 pm. “After meeting the official, we decided to temporarily end our protest as he conveyed to us the Union government’s decision to accept five of our 15 demands,” he said.

Pooran Singh, president of BKS, said the delegation would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press for their other demands once he returns from the US. “If our remaining demands are not met, we will gather again for a protest march. People are talking about that number of participants in the march. Anyway, we have achieved something and we are not returning empty-handed,” he said. Kishan Pal, a farmer from Saharanpur, said he has no money to repay a loan of Rs 5 lakh that he had taken. “The Modi government promised during the election campaign that sugarcane dues would be settled within 14 days. But yet, nothing has changed on the ground,” he said. “If all our demands are not met by government, I will be left with no option but to commit suicide,” Pal said. In 2018, a similar protest march turned violent as police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesting farmers at the UP-Delhi border. "
Lucknow,Coma dilemma: White paper soon on ventilator plug,"LUCKNOW: Should a terminally ill patient be put on ventilator? How long should doctors and caregivers continue to treat a patient in coma? These questions that haunt doctors and attendants may soon be addressed by the Union government’s decision to bring out a white paper on Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) – a concept that gives patients and kin the right to withhold or withdraw treatment like use of ventilator. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is scheduled to release the white paper by December, said director-General ICMR Dr Balram Bhargava, who was in Lucknow on Saturday to address the annual conference of Association of Physicians of India. “Doctors and family members are in perpetual dilemma when it comes to reviving an elderly or critically ill patient, who could be suffering from multiple chronic problems or syndrome with minimal chances to bounce back. Medical law on this count is imprecise and decision-making for family members is a Catch-22 situation, which often aggravates due to social pressure. Many developed nations follow the ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ guidelines to address the issue. We are also working on similar lines,” said Dr Bhargava. DNR is about accepting natural death, says expertNEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Speaking to reporters at the conference hosted by King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Dr Bhargava said a panel of experts and stakeholders, including critical-care physicians, cancer specialists, geriatric physicians, legal-eagles, community health, and public health experts are among others working on the DNR white paper. Elaborating on the concept, KGMU’s Dr D Himanshu said: “This dilemma comes with a cost, which often burdens the healthcare system, particularly caregivers. In India, due to shortage of ventilators, patients in waiting list also suffer.” This is exemplified by the situation at KGMU, which has 260 ventilators with 100% occupancy and waiting list of 50 at any given point of time. To a query on how DNR was different from euthanasia, Dr Himanshu said: “Unlike euthanasia where a patient is put to death, DNR is about accepting death naturally. In mercy killing, patient may be introduced to external agents to expedite painless death, but in DNR, patients are aware that death is inevitable and consciously avoid painful medical procedures or situations.” City geriatrician Dr Abhishek Shukla, who often witnesses the dilemma, said: “The paper will pave way for a policy on DNR by bringing focus on how to live and die with respect and autonomy.” Citing global data in his book ‘Health and Well Being in Late Life’, author Prasun Chatterjee noted over 90% of American ICU patients have the right to withhold or withdraw a medical treatment process. He pointed out that in UK, British Medical Association and the Resuscitation Council (UK) has a precise DNR procedure. "

Lucknow,"Travel bug hits small town India: Tourism demand sees spurt in Tier 2, 3 cities","NEW DELHI: If you are familiar with the remarkable story of Vijayan, the 69-year-old tea stall owner from Kochi who has travelled to over 20 countries with his wife despite his meagre means, you’ll know travel and wanderlust is no longer the domain of the privileged few. As more Indians hit the road to explore uncharted territories for work or holiday, it is travellers from the farthest corners of the country who want to be out and about. What’s more, travel companies have spotted this fast-growing market and are rolling out the red carpet to woo the backpacker and the budget traveller, the adventure enthusiast and well as the luxury vacationer. Take VFS Global for instance. The world’s largest outsourcing and technology services specialist for governments and diplomatic missions worldwide kick-started its doorstep delivery for visa services in 2016. In one year, the demand for doorstep delivery of visas across India grew by 144%, with the highest demand coming from Goa, Lucknow, Nagpur, Bhubaneswar, Mangaluru and Gurgaon. Even as applications from metro cities increased, first-time demand for doorstep visa services came from cities like Allahabad, Amravati, Thiruvananthapuram, Erode, Surat, Nagercoil, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Tiruppur, Muzaffarpur, Palakkad, Indore, Guwahati, Jodhpur and Chattarpur (MP). The highest number of visa applications, VFS Global said, was processed in Nagpur, followed by Indore. In Shillong, doorstep visa applications grew from two in 2017 to 150 in 2018.

Tourism boards too are tapping smaller cities to woo the first-time traveller. The Seychelles Tourism Board, for instance, travelled to Lucknow, among other cities, to offer immersive experiences and holidays tailored to the size of the tourist’s budget. Thomas Cook India, a separate entity from Thomas Cook UK after it was acquired in 2012, said it had seen a strong shift in source markets to India’s regional Tier 2 and 3 cities with Amritsar, Karnal, Guwahati, Ranchi, Aurangabad, Visakhapatnam, Hubli, Udaipur and Vijaywada registering higher demand for travel offerings than metro cities.

Industry experts attribute the growth in demand for travel products to changes in consumption patterns and improved connectivity, which allows Indians to explore and aspire. “Small-town travellers are opting for destinations like Dubai, Europe and Southeast Asia. Apart from an increase in disposable income, the biggest factor for growth is improved airport infrastructure and air connectivity,” said Daniel D’souza, president and country head (leisure) at SOTC Travel.

But, since dynamic pricing is based on demand, the fare for festive days is already four times more. Tejas has no tatkal option and hence, dynamic pricing is a passenger’s best bet.

Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh: Women IAS, IPS to boost 'matri shakti' in hinterland","LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh government will send its women officers - IAS, IPS and IFS - to the districts to spend three days to help strengthen ""matri shakti"" (women power). Chief minister Yogi Adityanath wants women officers to cover all 75 districts during their three-day camps and return with their feedback for the state government to help it ensure gender equality and end bias against the girl child. The idea behind sending women IAS, IPS and IFS officers to camps for three days in every district to interact with women, young girls and the menfolk to educate them against ills like female infanticide and violence against women both within and outside homes. They will also find ways to ensure girls are sent to schools, their enrollment is enhanced and awareness about nutrition and better health is created. The chief minister feels there is immense potential for government's intervention in empowering for women and the girl child, which is being done through ""Kanya Sumangala Yojana"" and other women and child development schemes. However, a direct feedback of the impact of government's planning and programmes can be an informal mechanism for intervention, he feels. With women officers going out to districts, the government feels discussions would be free and open with womenfolk.

Ghaziabad,Complaint against 12 for housing scheme fraud,"GHAZIABAD: A complaint has been lodged against 12 residents of Dasna for allegedly getting a subsidy of Rs 2.5 lakh each under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban) fraudulently, Ghaziabad administration officials said on Sunday. The administration said that five surveyors of a private firm, Rudrabhishek Enterprises, who had been entrusted with carrying out the survey and geo-tagging the plots under the scheme, also connived with the accused and endorsed their claims. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey has also written to the government to impose a fine of Rs 5 lakh on the firm. An FIR will be registered on Monday, officials said, adding recovery certificates will be issued to the accused to reclaim the subsidy. The PMAY (U), launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2015, aims to ensure housing for all by 2022 by providing financial assistance to beneficiaries. The scam came to light during the ongoing verification of land registrations in all tehsils in the district. The current case pertains to grants given by the District Urban Development Agency (DUDA) to beneficiaries to build a house on their own plots under the scheme. DUDA official Pawan Sharma said, “Eight of the accused had produced forged documents to obtain the subsidy. The investigation revealed that the eight residents already had pucca houses on the plots for which they sought subsidy. The other four accused had shown government land as their own for receiving the benefits.” Sharma informed that the company is responsible for conducting the survey, preparing detailed project reports, geo-tagging as well as giving technical support to beneficiaries in building houses. Last week, an FIR was registered against eight persons, who bought and sold government lands in Loni area, and the sub-registrar under whose watch the registries were executed. "

Lucknow,BJP faces fractured opposition in Hamirpur by poll,"LUCKNOW: The BJP will face its first acid test on Monday when Hamirpur goes to by poll, necessitated following conviction of sitting BJP MLA Ashok Singh Chandel in a 22-year-old murder case. Riding high on over whelming performance in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and completion of two-and-a-half year of rule in UP, the BJP will face an otherwise fractured opposition with the two regional giants, SP and BSP, breaking their tie up they stitched to arrest the juggernaut of the saffron party in the general elections. While the BJP has placed its bet on a Thakur, Yuvraj Singh, the SP and Congress have fielded OBC candidates -- Manoj Prajapati and Hardeepak Nishad, respectively. The BSP has played the Muslim card by fielding its zonal coordinator Naushad Ali in a bid to corner minority votes. Despite its defeats in the byelections in Gorakhpur, Phulpur, Kairana and Noorpur last year, the BJP is confident of retaining the Hamirpur seat. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said that the voters would not be swayed by caste politics of the opposition parties and would instead give weightage to the governance of Yogi Adityanath government in the state and Narendra Modi government at the centre. ""A number of projects including an expressway and defence corridor had been initiated by the state government for the Bundelkhand region. People understand which party thinks of their welfare,"" he said. BJP sources said that the party hopes of cornering the upper caste votes while relying on division of OBCs and Muslim vote bank amongst the opposition parties. The SP leadership, however, maintains that there would be no division of votes. ""We would be getting votes of every section of society. The result would show that,"" said SP state president Naresh Uttam Patel, while speaking to TOI.

""Earlier there was a possibility of Muslims getting divided but now they know that their welfare lay in siding with the BSP,"" he said. Ali said that his party stood for the welfare of Sarv Samaj and therefore its candidate would garner votes from a cross section of communities. The Congress leadership hopes of getting the local support in a considerable way. UP Congress committee general secretary Dwijendra Tripathi said that the party candidate is a local worker of Congress and wields considerable influence in the region. ""It is the BJP and other opposition parties which does politics of caste and religion,"" he said. Political experts said that a four cornered fight in Hamirpur would set the tone for all political parties in the by polls for 11 seats due next month. ""The political scenario has changed completely after SP and BSP broke their tie up. It would be a four cornered fight in all 13 seats, including Hamirpur,"" said an expert. "

Lucknow,Small traders exempted from annual GST returns; hotel stays become cheaper in UP,"LUCKNOW: Around 5 lakh traders in Uttar Pradesh are expected to benefit from a recent decision by the GST Council which exempts those with a turnover of Rs 2 crore or less from filing annual returns for 2017-18 and 2018-19. Another reduction that was announced was in the tax rate for hotel rooms to boost occupancy and catering. However, a quick analysis shows that this could mean a revenue loss of around Rs 100 crore annually, till occupancy actually does pick up. Amrita Soni, commissioner commercial tax, said that there are at least 5 lakh traders in UP with an annual turnover of Rs 2 crore or less who were facing problems in compliance, for whom the new rule will come as a boost. The rule is yet to be notified. All traders have been expected to file either monthly or quarterly returns, along with an annual return each year since implementation of GST. “There were some issues with compliance because of which the filing of annual returns has been made optional,” said Soni. However, finance experts in the city believe that the decision by the GST council to exempt traders from filing the annual return was not taken for any other reason but because of a system error that was not allowing assessees to rectify errors made in monthly or quarterly returns.

After much back and forth, it was decided to allow industries to make changes in annual returns. However, when people attempted making revisions to previous returns in their annual returns, the system would not permit them to do so. “Instead of rectifying the system, it seems that the government has simply exempted traders and industrialists from filing annual returns. While this may have eased compliance for assessees, it also means that there are several errors in returns for the past two years. GST was implemented in 2017-18 when several teething troubles were experienced. Most of the pending errors will now not be rectified,” he said. Meanwhile, the industry is also expecting a boost in occupancy of hotel rooms with GST being reduced from 28% to 18% and 12% respectively for various categories of rooms. "

Lucknow,"Busy street stops: Bikers chase, shoot and scoot in Lucknow","LUCKNOW: It was a shooting sequel straight out of a Bollywood crime flick when two bike-borne assailants chased a 45-year-old man on AP Sen Road in morning rush hour on Monday, shot at him, stopped when he fell off his bike, then went up to him and fired from close range before speeding away. The gunmen had assumed he was dead. The daring attack on Mohammad Shahnawaz (45), a resident of Gausganj, Wazirganj, allegedly took place over a 17-year-old dispute over ancestral property.

Lucknow,No police on your trail: Hit and run at will,"LUCKNOW: Over the past week, three cases of hit-and-run have been reported in the city. However, police were not able to make any arrests or even trace the vehicle in any of the cases. In the case of Gomtinagar Extension last Sunday, police lodged an FIR only 24 hours after TOI highlighted the issue. Seven days later, police have failed to make any breakthrough. It seems that it is becoming casual for errant drivers to mow down commuters and go scot-free. All tall claims of smart policing are yet to be seen on the road.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: 2 ponds ready for Durga immersion, 6 in works","LUCKNOW: Breaking the century-old tradition of immersing Durga Puja idols in the river Gomti, a number of puja committees in the city will go for an eco-friendly visarjan this year by immersing the goddess in artificial ponds. The district magistrate on Monday assured the members of Lucknow Durga Puja Coordination Committee (a body representing all puja committees of Lucknow) that around 10 ponds will be dug for this at three spots—Lakshman Mela ground, Jhulelal Ghat and Panchmukhi Hanuman Mandir, which is in front of the Ghat. On Thursday, the committee members had submitted a request to the district administration requesting for 12 artificial ponds, each 60ft x 60ft and 15 metres deep, at the three identified spots on the riverbank in place of artificial pits that the administration had offered earlier. According to the delegation, the pits suggested were too small for visarjan of 12ft-15ft-high idols.

Work is underway,” said the ADM. LMC commissioner Indramani Tripathi said that as of now two ponds—30ft x 18ft and 20ft x 15ft—have been constructed at Jhulelal Ghat. Immersion will be done after barricading the pond and laying down a non-percolating sheet. “After surveying the areas, two more ponds can be constructed at each of the three sites. Every pond has a different dimension, taking into consideration the height of the idols and the area allotted. At least four idols can be immersed in a single pond,” said Tripathi. The proposed dimension of two more ponds at Jhulelal Ghat is 50ft x 20ft and 30ft x 20ft. At Panchmukhi Hanuman Mandir, two ponds of 25ft x 15ft and at Laxman Mela ground, two ponds of 30ft x 20ft size will be made.

Lucknow,Satisfied with Shahjahanpur SIT probe: HC,"ALLAHABAD/ SHAHJAHANPUR: The Allahabad high court on Monday refused to grant relief to the Shahjahanpur law student who sought a stay on her possible arrest in an extortion case filed by BJP leader and former Union minister Swami Chinmayanand, whom she has accused of raping her. The high court also expressed satisfaction over the report of the special investigation team (SIT) probing her allegation of sexual harassment against Chinmayanand. The division bench directed the SIT to submit further progress report regarding investigation of the matter and fixed October 22 as the next hearing of the case. During the course of hearing on Monday, the woman was present in the courtroom. “If the victim wants any relief in this regard, she may file a fresh petition before an appropriate bench,” the court said, adding, “This bench was nominated to the case only for monitoring the investigation in this matter and has no jurisdiction to pass order on stay of arrest.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.The bench also did not accept a second prayer by the woman, who sought permission to record a rectified or a fresh statement under Section 164 of the CrPC as she said her earlier statement made before the magistrate was not proper. The court observed that there was no allegation against the magistrate concerned nor any provision had been shown for recording a rectified statement of the woman. In another development, Chinmayanand was shifted to Lucknow’s Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) from Shahjahanpur district jail for angiography early on Monday. The BJP leader’s shifting to Lucknow hospital coincided with a local court in Shahjahanpur rejecting his bail plea. The bail application was filed by his lawyers Om Singh and Manendra Singh. The BJP leader’s counsel said he will now approach the district judge to seek bail for him on medical grounds. Chinmayanand has been admitted to the intensive care unit of SGPGI in Lucknow, where cardiologists examined him, jail superintendent Rakesh Kumar said. Chief medical superintendent, SGPGI, Amit Agarwal said angiography was done and no significant blockage was found, adding that angioplasty was not required. The chest pain Chinmayanand suffered from was linked to his diabetes, Agarwal said. The 72-year-old will be stabilised with medicines in four or five days and his discharge will be planned in due course of time, according to the doctor. The CJM's court in Shahjahanpur also approved remand of the law student's three friends to SIT for 96 hours for recovery of evidence. The SIT will take them to the places they had visited along with the woman to recover her missing mobile phone and other articles. The former Union minister was arrested on Friday and sent to 14 days’ judicial custody. He has been booked under sections 354 D (stalking), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). But, instead of section 376 (rape), the 72-year-old has been booked under section 376 C, which is usually applied in cases where a person abuses his position to “induce or seduce” a woman under his charge to have “sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape”. If proved, a rape charge can lead to punishment of up to life imprisonment, while someone convicted under Section 376C can be jailed for between five and 10 years.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad’s power theft cases highest in Uttar Pradesh, a police station to tackle them soon","GHAZIABAD: To deal with a surge in power pilferage over the years, Ghaziabad will soon get a dedicated anti-power theft police station. A report prepared by the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited last year pegged Ghaziabad as the district with the highest number of power theft cases in Uttar Pradesh. These cases, however, got buried in police stations, which were already inundated with criminal and civil cases. “The cases could not be prioritised by regular police stations. So, an anti-power theft police station is coming up at Vasundhara and should start functioning in a fortnight,” said RK Rana, chief engineer (distribution) at the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Ingam (PVVNL). “The dedicated police station will have four sub-inspectors and 16 constables of UP Police on deputation, assisted by our vigilance teams,” he added. The team will be well-versed in the provisions of the Electricity Act, which governs cases of power theft.

Another 4,502 defaulters opted for compounding, which means they were let off after they deposited a fine. A large number of cases, however, remain lodged with no progress. With dedicated power theft police stations, the pressure should ease,” Rana said. Areas like Loni, Modinagar and Muradnagar alone account for over 70% of power theft cases. Defaulters in these areas also owe Rs 90 crore of the Rs 123 crore owed to the power department. “The power department identified 26,000 defaulters in paying power dues till August 31 … There are also lots of government departments on the defaulter list, owing us a total of Rs 13 crore. The police, education and health departments top the list,” he added. The Uttar Pradesh cabinet had approved dedicated police stations in all 75 districts of the state to check power theft last year. In August this year, the first two anti-power theft police stations were inaugurated in Prayagraj and Kaushambi. Gujarat and Maharashtra have also set up separate police stations to deal with power theft. The Delhi high court, however, had declined to order a dedicated anti-power theft police station and said that a separate investigation unit should be set up instead. "
Ghaziabad,Unsold flats in Akhilesh Yadav’s scheme put Ghaziabad Development Authority in a spot,"GHAZIABAD: The erstwhile Akhilesh Yadav government’s pet project to provide affordable houses under the Samajwadi Awas Yojana has the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) tied up in knots after the change of guard in the state. With the BJP at the helm in the state, the GDA is now in a fix as to how to dispose the 1,352 unsold units that were built under the scheme in 2015. Since the BJP government under Yogi Adityanath took over, the GDA has put a freeze on the sale of the units. “In 2015, we had constructed 2,564 affordable dwelling units under the Samajwadi Aawas Yojna at Indraprastha, Koyal Enclave and Maduban Bapudham. We managed to sell 1,212 units,” said an official.

Even after so many years, there is no clarity on how we should proceed to sell these houses. Selling the units under the name of Samajwadi Awas Yojana, which bears the stamp of the erstwhile regime, might not be acceptable to the present government,” the official added. The GDA has now sought directions from the state government to decide about the fate of the unsold units. With the maximum price of a unit fixed at about Rs 30 lakh, more than Rs 400 crore is stuck in the current scenario. “We have sought directions from the state government to guide us in determining the cost of the units and also under what scheme can we re-launch it,” said the official. The Samajwadi Awas Yojana had been floated and approved as an affordable housing scheme. Any change in name would mean that it would cease to be the same scheme and the cost of each unit will automatically increase by 6%. “It was an affordable housing scheme and to keep the cost on the lower side, we had waived 6% of the cost under contingency and supervision charges. If ‘Samajwadi’ word is dropped from the name of the scheme, by default the project would cease to be an affordable housing scheme. That would increase the cost of each unit by at least 6%,” the official said. “The government, to find a way out, could change the name while keeping the basic feature of the scheme intact. But that can be done by the government alone,” the official added. "

Lucknow,"UP trashes old law, CM and ministers will pay taxes now","LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Tuesday repealed the controversial provision in the UP Ministers (Salary, Allowances, and Miscellaneous) Act of 1981 that put the burden of paying the income tax of the CM and the council of ministers on the state exchequer. Reacting to an exclusive TOI report earlier this month which highlighted the almost 40-year-old rule, CM Yogi Adityanath had asked finance minister Suresh Khanna to prepare a cabinet note for withdrawal of the pertinent section from the Act. “Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of this law which put the burden of the tax on the state exchequer was brought in 1981. Those covered under income tax laws need to pay their own tax and the cabinet has decided that there is no rationale to continue with this law any longer,” said government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma, adding that since the Assembly was not in session at present, the cabinet had agreed to bring in an ordinance to ensure that the amendment was implemented with immediate effect.

In the last financial year, the exchequer shelled out Rs 86 lakh for Yogi and his ministers.

Lucknow,Lucknow Development Authority maps out plan to end irregularities,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) is planning to modify the process of approval of maps for housing units and commercial buildings to check unauthorised constructions and harassment of builders. The authority has decided to conduct spot verification before putting the final stamp. Earlier, maps were approved first and spot verification was done later.

Gaur regretted the way in which local officials conspired with people in power then to dispossess tribals—who tilled land that they possessed for decades—to hand over their land to the society.

The SIT team is visiting several districts in UP and Bihar to record statements of co-operative society members but finding it difficult as they are now old and, in some cases, are untraceable. The BJP government in the state was targeted by the Opposition not only because of the bloody massacre but also for the way the district administration was perceived to have favoured one powerful group of villagers headed by the village pradhan. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra even staged an indefinite dharna till she was allowed to meet the victims of the massacre and the administration had to finally agree to arranging her meeting.

ASP (STF) Satyasen Yadav said since 2016, Khandwa became a major hub of illegal arms. “The Sikligar tribe in this region has become adept in making lookalikes of the German Mauser and the Italian Beretta, with similar 9mm and .30 and .32 bores.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.The ASP said these duplicates were sold at affordable prices. “Hence, Khandwa is giving stiff competition to Munger. The guns made here are more sophisticated and lighter in weight,” he said, adding that the arms of Khandwa had also made inroads in NCR and Rajasthan. On the marketing strategy, Yadav said contrary to Bihar gangs, who smuggle firearms in bulk, those in MP use human couriers. “Our investigations have revealed that they search for needy youths and lure them with handsome commission. These youths bring in arms — usually one or two at a time — by bus. Initially, the gangs tried to sneak in 10-12 guns at a time, but many couriers got arrested. Now, they have changed strategy,” the ASP said. Another senior STF officer said, “People with licensed guns must be asked to submit all shells before being issued live cartridges.” The officer also hinted that licensed arms holders often sold ammunition in the grey market for a premium.

Lucknow,What Lucknow Development Authority hid for 8 years: Poor structure hit flats’ sale,"LUCKNOW: LDA’s planning and development department constructed 32 row houses in 2011 at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore under affordable housing scheme in Viraj Khand, Gomtinagar, but did not put them on sale due to poor quality of construction. The department concealed the information from senior officials of the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) over the years leading to huge losses. The ‘scam’ was detected recently when LDA vice-chairman PN Singh accidentally came across the file having details of the project while preparing a list of unsold flats in the city. In a reality check, TOI found the row houses in a dilapidated condition. The walls are covered with green algae and plaster has peeled off the walls. Wood used in windows and doors has decayed while toilets are in a bad shape. The vacant space outside houses are being used for dumping garbage.

Lucknow,"2 yrs on, probe clears Dr Kafeel in death of kids due to lack of O2","LUCKNOW: Two years after he was suspended from Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College, a departmental inquiry against paediatrician Dr Kafeel Khan has absolved him of the charges of medical negligence, corruption and not performing his duty to the fullest on the day more than 60 lives were lost at the hospital due to oxygen shortage in August 2017. The report was handed over to him on Thursday by BRD officials. Kafeel had spent nine mon- ths behind bars for the charges of which he has now been absolved of. Out on bail, he continues to be suspended from the institute. He has demanded a CBI probe into the incident. T he report was submitted on April 18 by investigating officer Himanshu Kumar, principal secretary (stamps &amp; registration department), to UP's medical education department. Kafeel has blamed the government for keeping him in the dark for five months.  The 15-page report, a copy of which is with TOI, says Kafeel wasn't guilty of negligence and that he had made all efforts to control the situation on the night of August 10-11, 2017. It says he had informed his senio- rs of the oxygen shortage and also provided seven oxygen cylinders in his personal capacity . The report, however, notes that Kafeel was involved in private practice till August 2016 but not after that.

Lucknow,"UP: Two years after BRD College tragedy, govt probe absolves Kafeel Khan","LUCKNOW: Two years after he was suspended from Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical College, a departmental inquiry against paediatrician Dr Kafeel Khan has absolved him of the charges of medical negligence, corruption and not performing his duty to the fullest on the day more than 60 lives were lost at the hospital due to oxygen shortage in August 2017. The report was handed over to him on Thursday by BRD officials. Kafeel had earlier spent nine months behind bars for the charges of which he has now been absolved of. Out on bail, Kafeel continues to be suspended from the BRD Medical College. He has demanded a CBI probe into the incident. The report was submitted on April 18, 2019 by investigating officer Himanshu Kumar, principal secretary (stamps &amp; registration department), to the medical education department of the UP government. The 15-page report, a copy of which is with TOI, states that Kafeel was not guilty of medical negligence on his part and that he had made all efforts to control the situation on the night of August 10-11, 2017, when for 54 hours, the hospital was dealing with oxygen shortage. The report, however, has noted that Kafeel was involved in private practice till August 2016 but not after that. As per the investigation report, Kafeel was not the nodal medical officer in charge of the encephalitis ward at BRD and that the documents contesting the same provided by the department were “inadequate and inconsistent.” The report accepts the fact that in reply to a recent RTI application submitted by Kafeel, the UP government had accepted that since May 11, 2016, assistant professor Bhupendra Sharma was in-charge of the ward. Himanshu Kumar’s report has also said that while an earlier investigation by the director general of medical education did delve into the accusation of private practice by Kafeel, there is no analysis by the officer on him being involved in the process for allotting tenders for oxygen supply amounting to corruption, or of medical negligence on his part at the time of the tragedy. It also clarifies that Kafeel had informed his seniors of the oxygen shortage, providing the inquiry officer with call details of the same and also presenting proof of providing seven oxygen cylinders in his personal capacity, on the night of the tragedy. Quoting Kafeel’s bail order of the Allahabad high court of April 25, 2018, the report confirms that “there is no material on record which may establish medical negligence against the applicant individually,” and that, “he was not part of the tendering process.” Kafeel has blamed the government for keeping him in the dark for around five months and not informing him about his being free from allegations made against him. “While the government has not been able to pin down the actual culprit yet, I have been made a scapegoat. The report was not sent to me in all these months. Now, the medical education department has asked me to come forth to present my case on the private practice issue, which is not even related to the tragedy,” he said. “The government should tender an apology, provide victims with compensation and the incident probed by the CBI,” he added.

The court separated his file from those pertaining to trials of former deputy prime minister L K Advani, M M Joshi, Uma Bharti and other co-accused as prosecution witnesses in his case are yet to be examined. While exempting personal appearance till further orders, special judge S K Yadav asked CBI to produce witnesses while framing charges against Singh under Sections 153-A (promoting enmity on grounds of religion), 153-B (assertion prejudicial to national integration), 295 (defiling place of worship), 295(A) (malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) IPC. While allowing the CBI plea on April 19, 2017, to prosecute Advani and others, Supreme Court had said CBI could move for trial of Kalyan Singh as soon as he ceased to be Governor. Singh lost immunity from criminal prosecution when his gubernatorial term ended in first week of September, prompting CBI to move special court on September 9 for summoning him. The special court framed charges against Advani and other co-accused on May 25, 2017. Trials continued after FIRs were lodged in Ayodhya in 1992 after the demolition and later chargesheets filed.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Want odd jobs done at home? App it up soon,"LUCKNOW: If your washroom is choked or there’s a blackout at home, finding an electrician or plumber will be a click away on your smart phone. The state government is ready to launch an app to link skilled labour from the unorganised sector for consumers wanting odd jobs done. The facility will be available in small towns of Uttar Pradesh, not just for the well-heeled in big cities. Being developed by National Informatics Centre, UP, in a project undertaken by the state labour and training department, the app is scheduled for launch in two months. Officials associated with the project revealed three features that would make the app different from similar versions in vogue. “First, it’s not a profit model. Neither consumers who download our app nor skilled personnel enrolling with us will have to pay. No money will be charged in transaction between the two sides,” said Kunal Silku, director, training and employment, UP. He said, unlike popular options, the app would work at hyper-local levels. “While popular apps are functional in few big cities of India, our app will collate data of workers from all cities from Noida to Ballia,” said Silku.

Though BJP’s Yuvraj Singh knocked out his closest rival and Samajwadi Party veteran Manoj Kumar Prajapati by 17,867 votes, the results brought the focus back on SP-BSP’s broken marriage as total votes polled by the former partners would have secured a comfortable victory margin of 10,000 votes. The polls, which were marred by floods and boycott calls, clocked a moderate turnout of 48.10%. Though BJP retained the seat, the win margin was reduced and so was the turnout.

Lucknow,"Lucknow drains higher than roads, upkeep shoddy: Experts","LUCKNOW: A faulty drainage system and shoddy cleaning of drains are, according to experts, the two primary reasons why the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) — despite having spent Rs 8.5 crore in the past year — has not been able to check waterlogging in the city. Former chief town planner of Pune Municipal Corporation Ratan Singh, who now lives in Lucknow, said clogged drains along with flaws in gradient and pipeline installation did not allow rainwater to flow out of many areas, resulting in waterlogging. Civic workers, Singh maintained, often leave behind silt and muck along drains after cleaning. These flow back into drains when it rains, taking things back to square one. Residents of Aishbagh easily identified with the above problem. “Before the start of monsoon, LMC workers came to our area and cleaned drains. But, they dumped all the muck and silt beside drains. Also, garbage is not cleared on a regular basis, which chokes drains further,” said Shivam Mishra.

The small channels lead to nullahs, which finally drain into the Gomti river. According to experts, there are leaks at the points where small drains connect with nullahs. This flaw in construction and maintenance causes drains and manholes to overflow. If the joints are fitted properly, one of the key reasons behind waterlogging can be eliminated. In many places, inadequate gradient or slope does not allow rainwater to flow into drains, resulting in waterlogging. Rana Pratap Marg and Jopling Road, for instance, are at lower level than drains. Apart from the primary problems, unauthorised plugging of drains to facilitate construction work is also to blame. The LMC, on its part, has not taken such individuals or agencies to task. Mahanagar extension offers a glaring example of encroachment. Resident Ajay Shukla complained that near J-Park 2, many people had levelled out drains outside their homes. “Rainwater has no room to flow out. Waterlogging in monsoon is common. I have lodged several complaints with the LMC, but to no avail,” he said.

Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh: Application, renewal of driving licence easier with new rules","LUCKNOW: Getting a driving licence or renewing one has become more convenient under the amended Motor Vehicle Act.

Training of drivers has also been emphasised upon under the Act. A licence will be issued only for the type of vehicle that an applicant is trained to drive. To prove his/her skill, the DL seeker will have to produce training certificate issued by an authorised driver training school. The new Act also makes dealers accountable. A person found driving an unregistered vehicle will be charged as fine five times the annual road tax or one-third of lifetime road tax of the vehicle, whichever is higher. The dealer who has sold the vehicle will be charged 15 times the annual road tax of the lifetime tax of the vehicle as a fine. In case of registration certificates issued on false information, a dealer will also be punished along with the owner. "

You have popularized folk music all over the country. How has your journey been? My musical journey has been tough and interesting at the same time. Although my journey has been challenging, I have enjoyed every bit of it. I'm the kind of person who believes that there’s no point living a life without challenges. It was a challenging life given the kind of perception we had about folk music a few decades back. I thought that we were a transitional generation of the times that saw people migrating from villages or people opting for nuclear families, where the connect of folk was also missing. Somehow I thought that not only as an artist but also as a person this needs to come on the front stage. Yet, I have enjoyed every bit of my journey.

Malini Awasthi receiving Padma Shri award from Pranab Mukherjee (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddqui) Malini Awasthi receiving Padma Shri award from Pranab Mukherjee (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddqui) How have you managed to keep folk music alive in the fast-paced world of today? I knew that the biggest challenge folk music faced was the challenge of diluting it, taking it away from the essence. People say that we got raunchy and there were double meaning songs, I say that’s the second challenge. Folk songs were gradually getting lost. Also, there was a generation which thought that these kind of songs are obsolete or songs of the grandparents’ generation. There was again a very poor or preconceived notion that people had started building that these songs belonged to the poor people, or the farmers and peasants, basically the down-trodden. I was scared of that perception. When you bring a new daughter-in-law in the house, you don’t throw away your grandmother. That’s what folk music is, the mother of all, mother of classical. I thought it’s time I take this to another level where people do not dare disturb/dilute the basic content of the song. I tried to make folk contemporary even in terms of presentation, right from carrying a bass guitar to a keyboard to even dressing up as a folk artist, even if it meant me having to dance in a lehenga. I solemnly believe folklores have great literature and people need to know about them. So, I try to narrate the story behind the song as its very important for the audience to know what a person is singing. I even tried to connect it (folk music) to mass by making them a part of the entire presentation because folk is all about connecting and interacting. So these are the changes I tried to bring in order to bring stability and keep them fresh and alive in today’s fast-paced world. How do you ensure that the younger generation connects with folk music? Folklores have great text and literature. I think the reason why most of the folk singers aren’t able to connect with people is that they don’t really narrate the story of the song. Whereas when I sing a song, I try to explain the story behind it to the people, it’s very important. How long can you expect the audience to just enjoy the rhythm and beats? I take my audience to a kind of time travel or to another land with my folk music. I feel nowadays people take anxiety and depression pills or a lot of times they feel the need to see a shrink because they don’t vent or express themselves well. Through folklore and music, not only does one feel elevated but it also helps them express. Time and again I explain this to people. Do you also teach folk music to the millenials? For almost 20 years when we were learning music, we used to live with our guru, eat the same food, cook for her, make her bed, etc. It was very organic in nature. This generation, however, is magical. They follow their heart. If they like singing, they'll sing, even their parents will support them. They know they only have one life and they'll make the most of it. Since the last 10 years many of the young boys and girls have been coming to me selflessly and I teach them very happily. How do you manage to keep folk music on a fast track in today's times? Life is fast track these days. Multitasking is a way of life one has to adapt in order to survive. In one day I'm a daughter to my father, a wife to my husband calling to check if he’s had his meals, daughter-in-law to my in-laws, mother to my daughter and son, and then as a professor and performer, I constantly keep preparing for workshops. Speaking of folklore, I would say folk was always on a fast track. Any folklore that talks about festivals or brotherhood or connecting is fast-track. The way marriages are celebrated, with Banna banni, ghudhchadi, these endless ceremonies are all connected with songs. There’s no ceremony without a song. So I’d say folk has always been on a fast track. Just like how water changes its forms as per the vessel it is kept in, I feel folk music changes as per generations. Folk music is and has been on fast track always. When I see a boy of present generation speaking in English queuing up to watch my performance, it becomes clear that folk is on fast track. How according to you has the popularity of folk music grown in leaps and bounds? Oh, it has immensely. There was this one time I was performing in Delhi, a young boy walked up to me and said, 'Ma'am when you sing Kahe Ko Byahi Bides, my mother starts crying and my sister got married two years back.' Then he added that he fights with his father because his father sold off the land in Bihar and migrated to Patna so that the boy could receive a better education. The boy said, ‘When I go back to Patna for holidays I realize that we have a 2-3 bhk (small place), and back in Bihar we had a huge land with mangoes and a well and everything else and it agitates me.’ Every time I recall that incident it only makes me happy. I could see that this is the younger generation that wants to go back to its roots and respects it. It is perhaps a generation which understands what all it has lost during its journey. It’s the nature of law, the more you move away, your villages will call you back. I look at it this way. We have tried enough to dodge folk, but now globally people looking for identity and are respecting their music and what their ancestors did. Folk isn’t outdated. The text in folk can teach you so many lessons of life. Its time we start looking beyond rhythm and melody. Folk teaches you oneness which is way more important. These days also you have remixes of old 90s songs or great old melodies. This itself explains where we have come. How difficult was it for you to popularize folk music? It’s very important to believe in yourself. If you think something is working for you, follow it, I did. I learnt classical all my life, yet I thought folk was something I needed to take in the forefront. I had people including my own friends and colleagues asking me why I was doing it and how it doesn’t suit my image. I would find it rather intriguing. The first battle was changing the mindsets of people. The second one was with the kind of programmes being offered. Even though the government would support folk, the private organisers would want you to sing those raunchy songs. I would have to be firm and say no even if that meant losing some shows. I have said no to a number of shows, but never compromised with my principles. People would tell me that it was all a mistake and a wrong message will come across about my attitude, but I was okay with it. I feel if you follow your heart, your conviction gives you that inner strength. You become brave enough to say no, which is difficult yet essential. -- By Yashi Agarwal "
Lucknow,Experimental theatre is on the fast track in Lucknow,"Gone are the days when theatre in Lucknow used to be about plain and simple plays being staged. Not only in the past two years has the number of plays being staged in the city risen remarkably, a lot has been experimented in theatre concepts too. Take for example the recent case of a unique story telling session titled 'Framed As a Terrorist'. Based on a true story of a man who was framed as a terrorist, it wan a one-man enacted play and what made the act memorable was the presence of the person on whom the story was actually based. Well if this was not enough, there was another play staged in the city by a group of youngsters which too had a unique concept. Titled 'Aamne Samne', the play was based on the burqa ban. From experimenting with bold concepts like these to having a comic play like 'Mach Mach Gadi' which had a live music band, the theatre scene in the city is heading steadily towards increased creativity. Vijit narrated the story of a man framed as a terrorist and jailed for several years in a theatrical adaptation on stage (BCCL) Vijit narrated the story of a man framed as a terrorist and jailed for several years in a theatrical adaptation on stage (BCCL) Well-known director Privendra Singh, who has produced several plays under the banner of Rang Pakhi, has not only produced the recent Framed As A Terrorist, he was also the first one to back a play like the Indian adaptation of the well-known Hollywood film Brokeback Mountain. ""Theatre in Lucknow today is not just loud dialogue delivery or having a Ram-Leela type content. If you want the younger generation to come and watch plays, you will have to get concepts that they can actually associate with. So whether it is about burqa ban or having a play about the love story of to homosexuals, concepts like these are bound to get one audience and Lucknow audience is now very open to such plays and concepts. It’s a well-read audience which is keen on watching different and hatt ke concepts like the one Lucknow theatre is experimenting with,"" opines Pravinder. One of the flag bearers of this experimental theatre in Lucknow is BNA alumnus Saransh Bhatt, who staged the Indian version of Brokeback Mountain in Lucknow. ""This generation is not deprived of information. While the older generation is still conservative in its thought hence shy away from bols or controvesrsial topics nor will they risk their credibility by experimenting. But now we are changing and the younger generation is keen to introduce new concepts in theatre. Now, it is changing and fresh content is delivered to the audience because of the young generation taking theatre forward,"" says Saransh.

Devang staged a play titled 'Gigolo', which was based on a life of a psychopath gigolo and was inspired by a true story, not only travelled to several cities in India with the play, he even took it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, held every year in Scotland. ""All the new young directors and actors including me, are bringing out experimental theatre because we are from this generation where we have to compete with a lot of things. This is the generation of streaming, youtube, web-series and television where content is easily available just a touch away. They won’t buy that same 400 years old Shakespeare drama or mythological plays unless they have something new to offer. That’s why I thought of this story and also presented it in a new way to the audience which they liked a lot."" A scene from the play Shakuntalam which had clowns as the main characters (BCCL) A scene from the play Shakuntalam which had clowns as the main characters (BCCL) Young theatre actor Parth Srivastava is also committed to doing experiment in theatre. Parth recently acted in a play titled A Mad Man’s Diary, which was based on human cannibalism. ""Our generation is widely influenced by Western theatre, which is one of the major reasons for us experimenting. Another major reason is that the youth have started to notice and pick out the flaws in the society and he is not afraid to boldly stage it and showcase all the flaws through plays. The major audience that consumes theatre is the youth, and hence look for something fresh and unique which leads to us experimenting with new content."" Play director and actor, Ahmad Raza Khan, who has been part of several such plays as actor and director, believes experiment is something which is needed right now. ""Experiment means to establish cause and effect, concept and stories have always been the same. What changes is how you twist it. And it majorly depends on the director, how he transforms the old contents into something new. That’s beautifully happening these days. It’s a definition of retaliation, experimentation means being a rebel and today’s youth is doing wonders in doing experiments and coming up with newer and fresh contents. We are seeing the change in terms of language, we did not talk about things that were taboo, but now we do, artists getting naked on stage and doing bold scenes are such examples of experiments. These things didn’t happen before. It is all happening because when a person gets bored of the same old things, he tries something new. Maybe the older generation still enjoys traditional theatre, but it has also become cliché for the younger audience. Doing experiments in our works gives us a feeling of satisfaction, and we know that the audience enjoys it too, so that is why we do experiments in our work."" A still from the play Mach Mach Gadi (BCCL) A still from the play Mach Mach Gadi (BCCL) Experiment was the need of the hour for theatre actor Vijit Singh, who has designed a concept of live story telling session using different props. ""Story telling sessions by theatre veterans is not at all a new concept. But what I am doing is definitely a new concept in theatre in India. Well, mostly we have seen theatre actors either doing book reading or story telling under the story telling sessions. I too witnessed one of a very well-known actor. But after paying 1000 rupees in Mumbai, I was disappointed that the actor only recited a story, sitting on chair. There was no experiment in this form of theatre. So, what I did was I tweaked the concept a bit,” shared Vijit, who now runs a series of stories in the name of Mussafir Kisson Wala. He adds, ""I decided to not only use the whole stage but also props. And sitting and reciting or telling a story made no sense to me or to the people of my generation. So I had to make it more relatable to the present generation. So, the story telling session was actually loved by the audience, especially the younger one and has now become a hit."" - With inputs by Saad Abbasi "

Lucknow,Mind it: Literary events are on a rise in Lucknow,"Abhishek.Shukla2@timesgroup.com Lucknow is not only known for its rich cultural heritage, chikankari and Lakhnawi food but also for its shiri zabaan as they say, which draws its inspiration from the renowned poets and writers over the decades, who have contributed immensely in strengthening the literature roots in the city. From small baithaks at homes of city folk to the national-level literary festivals, the city is on a fast track for literary events. In fact, in the past few years, the number of literary activities has grown manifold. The Lucknow Literature Festival, Sahitya Adda, Sangat, Katha Kathan, Repertwahr festival, Kabir festival, several private baithaks, poetry reading sessions are just a few examples of such fine events happening in the city. Yatindra Mishra and Vishal Bhardwaj at Sangat, a literary and cultural forum (BCCL)  Yatindra Mishra and Vishal Bhardwaj at Sangat, a literary and cultural forum (BCCL) The ongoing National Book Fair which is in its 17th edition has not only served as a public platform for the budding writers of the state since its inception but also for the book lovers of the city. Sharing his thoughts on how the literary aspect of the city has evolved, Manoj Singh Chandel, Convener, National Book Fair in Lucknow, says, “Lucknow has been the birthplace and workplace of several eminent writers such as Yashpal, Amrit Lal Nagar, Bhagwati Charan Verma, KP Saxena to name a few. So much so is the craze for book fair in a city like Lucknow, that on public demand, we have started conducting another book fair with a different name during winters. So we now have several book fairs in the city” Talking about how literature rules at the book fair, he says, “You would be surprised know that the most sold books are of literature. Not only in Hindi but there is a huge market for English literature too and because of this several publishers prefer our book fair instead of other book fairs.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Talking about the contemporary aspect and how the popularity of literary activities is growing in the city, Yatindra Mishra, a National Award-winning writer and founder of Sangat, a literary and cultural forum for creative dialogues in arts, points out, “Apart from the literary festivals that are organized throughout the year, house-to-house baithaks have really played an important role in reviving the interest of the younger generation in literature. There is an undercurrent which is making more and more youngsters prefer such literary activities over cafes and discotheques.” Mishra though feels the city has been for long known for its rich literature, it’s only now that it is getting revived with the help of the younger generation, “Lucknow always has been a center of literature and music. Awadh ke jo nuances hain Urdu and Hindi mix language, thumri, ghazal and other semi-classical genre have now got a proper revival. Looking at the contemporary aspect, many new people have come up to take it to a new level,” says Yatindra.

From literary addas, book cafes, open mic poetry sessions to random poetry and storytelling, there is the whole gamut of literary activities being organized in the city. People have started reading and the good aspect is that they are not only reading English but Hindi as well. Also so many new budding writers have come-up, jo ki rozmarra ki bhasha mein likh rahe hai, which the readers can relate to.” Not only restricted to reading more and more literature but people today have started writing too on various global issues, feels Ravi Mishra, co-founder of Sahitya Adda, a literary forum for academic discussion and creative writing for young and scholarly, who shares, “Earlier, the awareness about such literary events happening in the city was not there and people would write in their notebooks to either keep it to themselves or share with their friends or family only. Youngsters now want to share their creativity with more and more people, all thanks to so many literary forums where you can find like-minded people. Around a decade back, writing meant writing in Urdu or Hindi, writing shayaris, getting inspired by Bollywood. But today youngsters are getting inspired by what it happening in the LGBT community, you may not be one yourself but still, they are able to identify and associate their sentiments with them. So, due to increased global awareness because of the social media youngsters are writing more on such issues and want to share it with the world hence leading to an increase in literature which in turn is leading to more literary events.” Taking book reading to the grass-root level, Katha Kathan’s Lucknow Chapter has been organizing story reading sessions in schools and colleges. “It’s heartening to see so many literary events happening in the city and attracting so many people from in and around the city. Kahani kisso ko interesting dhang se padhne padhane se youngsters get attracted and in turn, the number of literature lovers increases, which is what is happening in the city these days. We have been promoting boli and bhasha among the masses so that they feel connected,” says Nutan Vasisth, founder member, Katha Kathan, Lucknow.

Kanpur,Kanpur emerging as Bollywood’s latest destination for film shoots,"Light, camera, action – these are the word which one can easily get to hear in Kanpur now. Call it an effort to make a film more realistic, now a lot of filmmakers want to shoot their films in real locations. Be it the ghats of Bithoor or DAV College or Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital or Kotwali in Kanpur, filmmakers are now exploring the city to shoot their films. While filmmakers use Kanpur as a canvas for their films, on the 16th anniversary of Kanpur Times, we explore the locations in the city which have attracted filmmakers. Years ago, filmmaker Shaad Ali shot his film Bunty Aur Babli in Kanpur. It was the Thaggu Ke Laddu shop at the overcrowded Bada Chauraha, the Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology and Kanpur Central Railway Station that the film showcased to the whole of India. Then came Sohail Khan for 'Dabangg 2', who took montage shots of the Kanpur Kotwali and used them in the Salman Khan starrer.

Vishal first shot Mardudhar Express in Kanpur and after that he was back in town for the film 'Hotel Milan Khilte Hai Gul Yahan Khil ke Bikharne Ko'. ""Kanpur has a number of virgin locations which can make the film look realistic and even more believable. Cities like Lucknow and Varanasi are seen quite often on the big screen. Every other filmmaker is shooting his film in these cities. I wanted some newness in my films and that’s why I chose Kanpur for shooting the films. I shot my films in places like the Shivala Market, Naveen Market, P Road Market and also at the ghats of Bithoor,"" says Vishal. Kanpur-born filmmaker Israar Ahmed also chose his hometown to shoot his debut film 'Lateef' starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He then shot for his second film Super Jasoos starring Rajpal Yadav and Sunil Pal in Kanpur. ""I like the huge bungalows that are there in the city so I shot at one belonging to my friend. That has lent a very nice old-world charm to my film,"" says Israar, who also shot at a resort in Jajmau.

Kaushik, shot at almost all popular spits of the city including Mall Road, Civil Lines, the Methodist High School and also at the Anwarganj Railway Station. While speaking to us before he started shooting for the film, Kaushik, who’s spent several years of his life in Kanpur, said, ""Since my movie is about a small town person, I thought Kanpur would be an ideal location for it. It has some very attractive locations to show on the big screen."" The director also canned shots in the Civil Lines area and the Ganga Barrage.

""There are a lot of queries from Bollywood filmmakers to shoot in Kanpur,” says Aroon Singh Dicky, a line producer. “Kanpur is quickly becoming a preferred destination of Bollywood filmmakers. Recently, filmmaker Honey Trehan shot for his film Raat Akeli Hai in Kanpur. After that it was filmmaker Amar Kaushik who was in Kanpur to shoot for Bala. Presently also an international project is being shot in the city. It’s the old British architecture, leather tanneries and ghats that make Kanpur a unique place for film shootings. In months to come people will see a lot of Kanpur on the silver screen. Take for instance, Kanpur will be seen a lot in Honey Trehan’s film which was shot at the Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital, Cawnpore Kotwali and at a tannery in Jajmau. Similarly, Amar Kaushik also shot for his film Bala at various locations in Kanpur. These days filmmakers want to shoot at real locations and Kanpur is full of them. I believe that there are many more locations in Kanpur which in future can be utilised for shooting films.""

The thing that is attracting filmmakers towards Kanpur is its old-world charm. Look wise most cities have changed but Kanpur has not changed much. Kanpur still has buildings that are quite old. For Aparshakti Khurrana’s film Kanpur, the makers wanted a very old looking house for the shoot. I found one such home in P Road and a major part of the film was shot there.""

Lucknow,Kanpur emerging as Bollywood’s latest destination for film shoots,"Light, camera, action – these are the word which one can easily get to hear in Kanpur now. Call it an effort to make a film more realistic, now a lot of filmmakers want to shoot their films in real locations. Be it the ghats of Bithoor or DAV College or Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital or Kotwali in Kanpur, filmmakers are now exploring the city to shoot their films. While filmmakers use Kanpur as a canvas for their films, on the 16th anniversary of Kanpur Times, we explore the locations in the city which have attracted filmmakers. Years ago, filmmaker Shaad Ali shot his film Bunty Aur Babli in Kanpur. It was the Thaggu Ke Laddu shop at the overcrowded Bada Chauraha, the Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology and Kanpur Central Railway Station that the film showcased to the whole of India. Then came Sohail Khan for 'Dabangg 2', who took montage shots of the Kanpur Kotwali and used them in the Salman Khan starrer.

Vishal first shot Mardudhar Express in Kanpur and after that he was back in town for the film 'Hotel Milan Khilte Hai Gul Yahan Khil ke Bikharne Ko'. ""Kanpur has a number of virgin locations which can make the film look realistic and even more believable. Cities like Lucknow and Varanasi are seen quite often on the big screen. Every other filmmaker is shooting his film in these cities. I wanted some newness in my films and that’s why I chose Kanpur for shooting the films. I shot my films in places like the Shivala Market, Naveen Market, P Road Market and also at the ghats of Bithoor,"" says Vishal. Kanpur-born filmmaker Israar Ahmed also chose his hometown to shoot his debut film 'Lateef' starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He then shot for his second film Super Jasoos starring Rajpal Yadav and Sunil Pal in Kanpur. ""I like the huge bungalows that are there in the city so I shot at one belonging to my friend. That has lent a very nice old-world charm to my film,"" says Israar, who also shot at a resort in Jajmau. Ravi Kishan during the shoot of Sanki Daroga at Lala Ram Swaroop Degree College, Unnao (BCCL) Ravi Kishan during the shoot of Sanki Daroga at Lala Ram Swaroop Degree College, Unnao (BCCL) The city locales are so much in demand that Stree director Amar Kaushik also headed home for his next titled Bala with National Award winning actor Ayushmann Khurrana.

While speaking to us before he started shooting for the film, Kaushik, who’s spent several years of his life in Kanpur, said, ""Since my movie is about a small town person, I thought Kanpur would be an ideal location for it. It has some very attractive locations to show on the big screen."" The director also canned shots in the Civil Lines area and the Ganga Barrage.

""There are a lot of queries from Bollywood filmmakers to shoot in Kanpur,” says Aroon Singh Dicky, a line producer. “Kanpur is quickly becoming a preferred destination of Bollywood filmmakers. Recently, filmmaker Honey Trehan shot for his film Raat Akeli Hai in Kanpur. After that it was filmmaker Amar Kaushik who was in Kanpur to shoot for Bala. Presently also an international project is being shot in the city. It’s the old British architecture, leather tanneries and ghats that make Kanpur a unique place for film shootings. In months to come people will see a lot of Kanpur on the silver screen. Take for instance, Kanpur will be seen a lot in Honey Trehan’s film which was shot at the Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital, Cawnpore Kotwali and at a tannery in Jajmau. Similarly, Amar Kaushik also shot for his film Bala at various locations in Kanpur. These days filmmakers want to shoot at real locations and Kanpur is full of them. I believe that there are many more locations in Kanpur which in future can be utilised for shooting films.""

The thing that is attracting filmmakers towards Kanpur is its old-world charm. Look wise most cities have changed but Kanpur has not changed much. Kanpur still has buildings that are quite old. For Aparshakti Khurrana’s film Kanpur, the makers wanted a very old looking house for the shoot. I found one such home in P Road and a major part of the film was shot there.""

Lucknow,‘Plogging’ among the many joys of giving this Daan Utsav,"The eleventh edition of #DaanUtsav, India’s festival of giving — which will be held between October 2 to 8 this year — will encourage NGOs, corporates, schools, colleges, communities and other influencers to come forward and make the philanthropic initiative a massive success. From CEOs to homemakers, vegetable vendors to designers — all are part of the people’s movement, offering their time, skills, money, materials for social good. If its #LivingMy-Promise campaign launched in 2018 has already seen 30 middle and upper middle class Indian families sign up to donate more than 50% of their wealth, collectively adding up to more than Rs400 crore, this year #GivingTuesdayIndia will be celebrated on October 8 and expects to see over Rs 50 crore raised through online challenges and crowdfunding campaigns. Platforms like Give Fundraisers, SmallChange, Donatekart, GlobalGiving and several others will offer matching or challenge grants. SkipThe NPCI will promote giving via UPI to NGOs, while the IamHere app will allow over 8700 non-profits to create engagement opportunities for the public. Launched with a composition by renowned music director Ram Sampath called #Pyaar-KaUtsav, the lyrics, penned by Ginny Dewan for this year’s #DaanUtsav represent the essence of the festival — the joy of giving and sharing. “The idea is so simple and powerful — each of us has the ability to give something. It is not about money, but about what we can share with others. When I first heard about the idea of #DaanUtsav, my instinctive reaction was to put together a theme song for it, and I can’t tell you how much I enjoyed doing it,” says Sampath. Different cities have planned different activities. In Mumbai, said volunteer Umesh Asher, some kiosks will be kept at Mumbai Airport and volunteers will engage with passengers and seek their help for the social causes. Stalls will be put at petrol pumps and outside Sahkari Bhandars for people to make donations. Since this is the 150th year of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary, a special drive through Village Social Transformation Foundation (VSTF), a Maharashtra government initiative, will engage over 900 villages in Shramdaan. “Villagers will join the initiative to make villages plastic free,” says Asher.

Lucknow,Lucknow: They recount agony of lost communication,"LUCKNOW: “A quake hit Kashmir recently and we don’t know whether our friends and relatives are safe. I can’t concentrate on my studies as it’s been over a month I heard from my parents,” said 23-year-old BCA student, Mustafa Raza Banday, a Baramulla resident, who’s enrolled at a private college in Noida.

I could connect over phone with my mother for a few seconds and she said, “Awaaz sunney ko taras gaye hai tumhari (Have been dying to hear your voice) and the phone went dead,” said Mustafa. He said he would send medicines to his diabetic father, but after internet, banking and other services were blocked, he’s on the brink. “I am extremely pained as I don’t know how to contact parents. On social media, I have been asking if anyone going to Kashmir could convey my message to my parents,” said BA (Honours) student Mujtaba. “We are here to study, but how can we be in peace when we are worried about the well-being of our parents,” he asked. Another student from Srinagar, Ammar, said, “My heart sinks whenever there’s news about shelling or natural disaster and the pain grows as I am unable to speak to my parents.

Ghaziabad,"Bags fashioned from clothes, to send plastic out of fashion","GHAZIABAD: For years, Shakti Khand in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram has been demanding that its massive dumpyard, a major source of pollution, be moved away. While that barely inches forward, thirteen residents of Shakti Khand-4 have decided to do their bit and address one aspect of the problem at the source — reduce plastic waste. They started small. Using old trousers and bedsheets collected from neighbours, they made 50 eco-friendly repurposed bags. The initiative was off to a good start. “We make the bags ourselves and don’t charge any money. Then we just hand them out in the neighbourhood,” says Anoop Kumar, a 39-year-old textile engineer who takes care of the production side of things. The team, all between the ages of 30 and 45, has people from all walks of life – there’s Manoj Choubey, who works in sales, Pawan Jethwani and Praful Gupta, who are chartered accountants, and Harsh, a doctor. After a successful two-week run, they decided to scale things up. “We got in touch with a manufacturer in Panipat to get fabric for another 500. The cost per bag came to Rs 30, so each of us chipped in Rs 1,000,” says Digvijay Singh, a trader and member of the team. On Sunday, they plan on distributing these environment-friendly bags to 100 more flats.

Yatindra Mishra, with his incisive questions, had the filmmaker, writer, director and producer open up and speak his thoughts like never before. “Jhumri Talaiya is not a fictitious place but exists very much in Hazaribagh district of Bihar. That is where I studied in the first batch of Sainik School,” said Jha when he was asked about his schooling. Born in a family of farmers in Bettiah, Champaran, Jha always had an inclination towards painting and art. “Every time there would be plays in school, I was called to make costumes and props and somehow that translated into filmmaking, which is also a form of art. I remember walking nine kilometres to Koderma, just to watch a Hindi film,” he added. Atrey and Sumita Bhargava and Navneet Sehgal (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Atrey and Sumita Bhargava and Navneet Sehgal (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) The filmmaker further spoke about how his struggle in his teens to early twenties shaped his life. “I got selected in the National Defence Academy, but I thought that after this my parents would want me to become an IAS officer since Bihar mostly produces IAS officers. So I decided to leave studies. At the age of 16, I left home for Mumbai with `300 in the year 1972. For the next five years, I had no contact with my family. That was the most crucial phase of my life,” he reminisced. He then jokingly talked about how he never really managed to get a degree but after meeting Agha Jani (responsible for the mirror work on the set for the Mughal-e-Azam song, Jab Pyar Kiya) who happened to be his neighbour in Mumbai, he got the chance to witness the shooting of Dharma from which his film journey began. While Jha was talking about his life, scenes from his films and documentaries were being screened in between. Speaking about venturing into acting and trying out new things, Jha said, “I have been making films for the past 45 years and I shall continue to make more films for the next 45 years. I have a knack for learning and I will continue experimenting for the rest of my life. Since I’m fond of music, I’m learning piano these days. I shall even consider asking a dance director to teach me dancing.

Gaurav Prakash asked Jha how he faced the onslaught before some of his movies released and especially from people like Sadhu Singh Yadav, to which he patiently replied, “All these dangerous people are very glamorous on the inside. They deep down want their names to come in limelight somewhere. Jab main ek film bana raha tha, Nana Patekar’s character was based on Shahabuddin. He was in jail at that time and called me from there to threaten me. He told me that he’ll file a case against me to which I asked him to bring a smart lawyer, so the case not only becomes interesting but benefits me as well. After that, he became my friend. In fact, nobody knew Sadhu Yadav before my film 'Gangaajal'.” The event concluded with Diwakar Bhattacharya, Yatindra Mishra and Nidhi Prakash felicitating the filmmaker and presenting a vote of thanks.

Kanpur,"BJP launches 7 rookies in bypolls, leaves Pratapgarh to ally Apna Dal","LUCKNOW: In a new strategy spin for crucial bypolls to 11 assembly seats next month, BJP catapulted seven grassroot-level functionaries to the centrestage of a high-stakes battle. The newbies will be taking on Opposition heavyweights in key constituencies, barring Rampur, Jalalpur and Lucknow Cantonment, where seasoned BJP leaders are in the fray. While announcing 10 candidates on Sunday, BJP left Pratapgarh to ally Apna Dal, which put Rajkumar Pal in fray. While Suresh Tewari has been given the ticket from Lucknow Cantonment, Rajesh Singh from Jalalpur, Bharat Bhushan Gupta will draw the battle lines in the high-voltage Rampur seat, where Samajwadi Party’s Tanzeen Fatima, wife of embattled SP leader Azam Khan is in the fray. Tewari, a three-time BJP MLA from Lucknow Cantonment and current president of BJP's Awadh unit, will take on Arun Dwivedi of BSP and Major Ashish Chaturvedi of Samajwadi Party. While all three parties have put up Brahmins, Congress has placed its bet on Dilpreet Singh, a Sikh. Likewise, in Kanpur's Govind Nagar seat, BJP decided to field its district president Surendra Maithani, who will test the electoral waters for the first time. Maithani will take on SP's Samrat Vikas and Devi Prasad Tewari of BSP and Karishma Thakur of Congress. In Rampur, seat vacated by senior SP leader Azam Khan after he was elected to Parliament, BJP fielded Bharat Bhushan Gupta, who hails from the trader community and is currently district-level party treasurer. Gupta contested on a BSP ticket against Azam Khan in 2012, but lost. He joined BJP before 2017 assembly elections. And this time, he will be up against SP's Tazeen Fatima, wife of Azam. BSP and Congress have fielded Zubair Masood Khan and Arshad Ali Khan respectively. This comes as a big setback for cine-star-turned politician Jaya Prada, who was staking claim for a BJP ticket in Azam's citadel.

Ghaziabad,"As onion rates soar in NCR, small traders feel the pinch","NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Mr Sharma asked the local food stall owner to put a little more of those caramelised onions in his egg roll. The owner declined him with a smile, and said he could have the roll for free instead of asking for more onion slices. Soaring prices of onion has prompted small eateries and restaurants to cut down on the use of the vegetable. So, the plate of vegetable salad now has fewer slices of onion and the onion pakoda has been taken off the menu. Homemakers, too, are preparing dishes that require less amount of the vegetable. In Noida, onions are selling at Rs 70-80 a kg in the retail market. In Ghaziabad, it is around Rs 60 a kg. Prices in Delhi are a little on the higher side — between Rs 60-80 a kg. Residents who have Mother Dairy outlets near their houses are, however, heaving a sigh of relief. The rate of onions at these outlets across Delhi-NCR is Rs 23.90 a kg, but one can only buy 5kg of the vegetable a day.

But for those who aren’t, the essential kitchen commodity has been burning a hole in the pocket. Traders blamed the floods in Maharashtra for the soaring prices, and said the rates are expected to remain so for the next one month. “We expect a turnaround in a month. Traditionally, this is the time of the year when yield is low, but the floods in Maharashtra have hit the supply chain. For those who owning big restaurants, this doesn’t matter much because they usually have a flat rate agreement with vendors all the year round. It is the domestic and small consumers who are affected by this steep price,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, convenor of the Confederation of All India Traders in Delhi-NCR. Mother Dairy outlets are keeping a close watch on the sale of onions. “Our supply and stocks are closely monitored. If we are found guilty of supplying it to other vendors, we have to pay hefty fines. So, until further notice from the government, onions will be available with all outlets at this rate (Rs 23.90),” said Devender Singh, a Mother Dairy vendor at Sector 28. But it is the local vegetable vendor who has had to take the hardest blow. With soaring prices, people have been buying onions in lesser quantities. “Our earnings have gone down considerably. There is a possibility price may rise further in the coming days,” said Bhola, a vegetable seller in Raj Nagar Extension. According to wholesale market dealers, the prices are likely to come down during Diwali, towards the end of October. “It is that time of the year when new produce is available,” said Shripal Yadav, president of welfare association at Ghaziabad subzi mandi.
