Lucknow,I got to act in the film just by chance: Lucknowite Yash Raaj Singh,"For Yash Raaj Singh, assistant director in films like 'Sultan' and 'Kill Di'l, the transition from behind to the front of the camera was quite by chance and smooth. The Lucknowite is currently relaxing at home and is basking in the success of his debut film 'War', as an actor, also starring Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff. The St Franciscan says he’s amazed at the stupendous success of War. ""I’m amazed at War. I never expected it to be such a hit. In the film, I worked as Assistant Director for almost four months but then ended up acting in it,"" says Singh, who played the role of Saurabh, a rogue agent and one of the main villains in the film. Yash Raaj Singh (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Yash Raaj Singh (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Telling us about how he happened to act in the action film, Singh says, ""I was with the film from its conception and ideation time. And since I’ve always loved action, I was called to assist in it. At that time there was casting going on for the villain and the team couldn’t find someone appropriate. So a member of the team was like ‘Yash why don’t you also audition for the role?’. And I was like ‘what?’ But then I just did it for the kicks and boom I landed the role! Let’s just say that ultimately I fit in the character."" Happy that his work has been appreciated by the audience as well as Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff, with whom Yash has shared the screen in the film, he says, “It’s like a dream come true. I’m really happy that my work is fetching me so much praise."" Yash Raaj always wanted to be an actor but before he took the plunge, he says he wanted to be familiar with all aspects of filmmaking. ""For that, I went to Los Angeles to study film making. I was there for a couple of years and observed their style of filmmaking. I wanted to get into films so I thought I’ll go to a film school, study films for a year and see if I have it in me or not. Then I came back did a few commercials and then began assisting in films and now I landed this acting job. So it’s like a tangible reality for me,"" says the fitness freak and the son of a former DGP of UP and a politician. ""My father was a police officer and my mother a politician, and I grew up on the streets of Lucknow and Eastern UP. Later, I studied criminal law and graduated as a lawyer from Delhi University. But I love cinema and the arts and that’s why I forayed in this field and now I can’t believe I’m being paid for what I love doing,” says Yash Raaj, adding, “And because of my parents I have seen the life of a cop and a neta real up close so I when I see films centered around them, I feel there is so much more that I have got to tell to the people. There are so many stories that I have seen in real life that I can tell."" Yash Raaj Singh (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Yash Raaj Singh (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)  A former member of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council (UPFDC), Yash Raaj says there’s a lot more that can be done to promote the state as a leading film production destination. “When I was studying in LA, there were several things there like the single-window system for permissions, that we replicated here during my stint in UPFDC. And although I am no longer part of UPFDC, I can proudly say that several of our ideas and policies that we implemented at that time, really clicked for us and UP became a sought after state for film shoots. There’s still a lot that can be done . We have all the required infrastructure apart from actors like locations, airports, good hotels, roads and of course good administrative support to have even more producers bring their films to UP,” says Singh. He also has several ideas which can be explored further, he says. “For instance, we should have more Hollywood films coming for shoots to India. When we go outside for film festivals, like at Cannes when I went there as a member of the UPFDC, you are pitching yourself like India only. You’re not showing the possibility of India being replicated for another country or a place that can be ideal for any film shoot. So what happens is that we loose out on foreign films because say, if my film doesn’t have India in it, then it’s useless for me to come and shoot here.So what we should do instead is that we should say we have the locations here that can be made to look like any country. That okay you want to shoot Zero Dark Thirty here, you want a place that looks like Iraq, you want a desert location, we can provide you all of that right here in India. We should say and publicise that we have that kind of place also which looks like Iraq and Afghanistan and Pakistan. Come and shoot here and we will give you crew that has experience of working with foreigners. Sultan had a Hollywood stunt director, so did War...so there’s familiarity in working styles, bas aao toh yahan. It should be the same for the state. Don’t pitch the state as just UP, say it is a perfect location for any film. It can be Bengaluru or Karnataka. Setting hum denge, bas apni film yahan lao!” Yash Raaj Singh as Sourabh in War (BCCL) Yash Raaj Singh as Sourabh in War (BCCL) The Lucknow guy, who has fond memories of hanging out in Ganj and Gomti Nagar, says that now he wants to give back to the state and aspiring actors here. ""I’m here in Lucknow for some time before the next project comes up, of which I am not at liberty to speak about. But in the interim, I would like to train aspiring actors in my city. Those who are serious about the profession, I would love to share whatever little I have learnt with them, so that when they go to Mumbai, at least they know what to do,"" says Singh, adding, ""A lot of deserving people are missing out on good chances because there’s no data base of actors in UP and nor is there a proper casting director here to tell filmmakers ki haan these are the people willing to act and this particular person may be the right one for your film. Till that happens, let me do my bit."" "
Kanpur,"Kanpur is now the ‘leather capital of India’, says Prez","“Down the ages, Kanpur always has had a unique relation with technological advance and using it for human advancement. One or other kind of technology took this city to greater heights in the 20th century. The city’s excellence in the textile industry earned it the name of ‘Manchester of the East’, when its mills competed with the best in the world,” Kovind added. “The textile boom led to setting up of a number of industries here, making the city an industrial hub. It also graduated to becoming a major trade centre and came to be called the ‘Commercial Capital’ of Uttar Pradesh. After the textile boom, it has been the leather technology that is remaking the city. It is now called the ‘Leather City of the World,” he said. “Given this connection with technology and industry, it is no wonder the city has been home to some of the best names in engineering education,” he said. “What is particularly unique about the city, is that its pursuit for material wealth is always accompanied by a determined effort to keep pace with the advanced education. Who in the world does not know the eminence of IIT-Kanpur. Along with this great institute exists an equally important centre of learning, Harcourt Butler Technical institute (HBTI), which has now become a full-fledged university. There are a host of other institutes which have produced excellent engineers and scientists,” the President said. “PSIT too enriches this heritage of the city. I congratulate the institute for organising this conference. I am sure it will prove to be an excellent platform for researchers and professionals from India and abroad to discuss latest developments in various domains,” the President said. “As we aim to become a $5-trillion economy by 2024 -25, we again look forward to technology playing its role. Apart from giving us economic might, new forms of knowledge have battered the lives of people on the margins of society. Moreover, advances in information and communication technology have been a great equaliser in all walks of life,” he highlighted. The President said technology is a great servant but a bad master. “This city has been witness to powers of technology to make as well as break. When you deliberate on the latest technological advancements, I would urge you to keep foremost in mind the implications for the humanity,” he said. "
Lucknow,Lucknow University set to replace internal exam with open online courses,"LUCKNOW: The Lucknow University authorities have decided to do away with internal examination, carrying 20 marks, for undergraduate students with massive open online courses (MOOCs) from the next academic session. The move will give students options to also study those subjects which are not taught to them in the faculty where they are enrolled. The proposal was approved by the academic council in its previous meeting after which a committee was formed to suggest ways for its implementation. The committee will submit its report in the next meeting of the council. Once approved, the new system will be implemented from the next session. LU’s officiating vicechancellor SK Shukla said, “In every semester, undergraduate students will have to opt for a course offered by MOOCs which is available at Swayam (e-learning) portal of the University Grants Commission.” “A student may opt for a course free of cost related to his/her stream at the undergraduate level or a new course of a different stream. After clearing the online test, students will have to furnish the certificate based on which internal marks will be awarded to them,” he said. The move aims at giving an option to a student of arts to study courses of streams like commerce and science. "
Lucknow,Bundelkhand expressway clocks fastest acquisition of land,"LUCKNOW: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi lays the foundation of the Rs 14,000crore Bundelkhand Expressway on December 16, it will set a record for the fastest acquisition of land for a highway project in the state. The 296km expressway cutting through the state’s backward backyard and straddling six districts, witnessed seamless acquisition of 3,440 hectare in record 10 months without an echo of protest from villagers. At least 20,860 farmers earned a total of Rs 2,200crore by selling drought-hit land and receiving four times the circle rate from the flagship project. At a time, when Niti Ayog flagged off the issue of complex land acquisition laws and exorbitant compensation in road-related projects as a strain on UP coffers, the Bundelkhand Expressway stands out as a successful model in terms of speedy land acquisition and low project cost. Talking to TOI, UPEIDA chief executive officer Awanish Kumar Awasthi, who is also additional chief secretary home and information, said land acquisition began in February and 96% acquisition was complete by November 30. The remaining 4% acquisition would be complete by the time PM Modi lays the foundation of the expressway. The daily acquisition rate of 11,433 hectares was a record in itself. When the project was approved by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the UPEIDA, executing agency of the expressway projects in the state, was required to purchase nearly 3,616 hectare in six districts, including Chitrakoot and Hamirpur in Bundelkhand and by November-end, 96% land was purchased from over 20,000 farmers. Payment of dues via RTGS cuts red tapeAlso, UPEIDA purchased land from farmers and directly transferred cost and compensation into accounts of farmers through real-time gross settlement (RTGS) from the state treasury, cutting red tape. The Bundelkhand expressway is a dream project of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who has been reviewing progress of the project in regular presentations and the cabinet has been swift in approving UPEIDA decisions. Timely acquisition also cut cost escalation by 12%. “The pathetic condition of the region which witnessed starvation deaths in the past also drew the attention of the chief minister, who visualised this project as a gamechanger that will trigger economic activity in Bundelkhand,” said Awasthi.

Lucknow,"Lucknow air quality to dip sharply in coming days, say experts","LUCKNOW: The air quality of Lucknow was ‘moderate’ for the second consecutive day on Saturday but it may deteriorate to poor and very poor in the coming days. Track the pollution level in your cityAs per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Lucknow was 182, up by two units in comparison to Friday. Experts said the AQI will increase gradually. “The air pollution levels dropped not only in Lucknow but in many parts of western and central UP in the past three days owing to strong winds and rainfall which cleared the pollutants hanging in the atmosphere,” said Director of Lucknow University’s air quality monitoring station Professor Dhruvsen Singh. “However, wind velocity and temperature are now declining and hence the possibility of fog formation is high. The pollutants will combine with fog to create smog, which in turn will lead to an uptick in air pollution levels in the days to follow,” he added. Meanwhile, Varanasi was the second most polluted city in the country with AQI 321, just 18 units less than that of Singrauli (339) in Madhya Pradesh. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Dengue count drops with chill after 600 cases in November,"LUCKNOW: Though the number of dengue cases has started declining in the city with drop in temperatures, November witnessed 600 dengue cases, the highest in the 13 years since the health department began keeping a monthly record. From 21 cases on November 19 to seven on Saturday, the number has come down significantly. Experts say it will go down further next week with the arrival of winter when day temperatures will drop below 25 degrees Celsius. This year, 1,561 people tested positive for dengue since January, the second highest after 2016 when total 2,772 patients in a year fell victim to the disease. However, if cases reported in November are considered, then the month this year tops the chart. In 2018, 238 were affected by the virus, while 80 were in 2017 and 400 in 2016. In charge of the vectorborne diseases control unit Dr KP Tripathi claimed that by December first week, the daily number of dengue cases is likely to come down to five. “The survival rate of dengue larvae is high when day temperature is above 25 degree Celsius and night temperature is above 16 Celsius, he said. Besides, with drop in temperature, people have started wearing full-sleeved clothes and stopped using coolers. As a result, the risk of mosquito bite is low and fresh water in coolers, which serves as breeding ground for larvae, is no longer available, he said. Head of the microbiology department at King George’s Medical University Amita Jain said, “Although the peak season of vectorborne diseases is over, the health department should not stop its anti-mosquito drive.” Test can tell need of platelet transfusion "
Lucknow,KGMU intern booked again for harassment,"LUCKNOW: A 2012-batch MBBS intern at KGMU, earlier booked on charges of sexually harassing a female junior but forgiven on tendering an apology, has allegedly started harassing girl students again.

Lucknow,Nawabi city not on a high while pegging on below 18 drinking age,"LUCKNOW: The city has earned itself the distinction of being “highly conservative” when it comes to liquor. A survey carried out by Kantar-NFX for National Restaurant Association of India found that two thirds Lucknowites queried for the survey said the legal age of drinking should be 25 years and above. Delhi, on the other hand, is the most liberal, according to this survey with a third of respondents asking for legal drinking age to be lowered to 18. The survey looked at respondents in Delhi, Gurgaon, Lucknow, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Vijaywada, speaking to about 500 people in each city. In Lucknow, 75% respondents were men while 25% were women. Of this, 61% were in the age-group of 25-35. In Lucknow, the survey says, only 13% respondents said the legal drinking age should be 18 years and above, 21% rooted for 21 years and above while 66% said it should be 25 years and above. The survey also identified key challenges faced by consumers while buying liquor in Lucknow, which includes inadequate licensed outlets in their vicinity and harassment from civic authorities. “More than four of five persons have to travel long distances to buy alcohol, indicating low density of retail outlets in the city. Nearly two of five consumers face unavailability of desired brands, either occasionally or always,” the survey says. For women, the fear of being harassed and teased is a major hindrance. They feel uncomfortable and unsafe purchasing liquor from certain outlets, the report says. Around 7 of 10 consumers have complained they witnessed illegal sale of alcohol after permissible hours, almost half reporting that liquor was sold to underage consumers. More than half respondents highlighted they have witnessed price variations across liquor vends and nearly 25% ended up paying more than 20% of the retail price. In letter to CM, NRAI calls for liberal lawsMore than half respondents said they have witnessed price variations across liquor vends and nearly 25% ended up paying more than 20% of the retail price. In a letter written by NRAI to CM Yogi Adityanath earlier this year, the organisation said: “Lack of adequate licensed outlets in Lucknow is limiting consumers from exercising their choice. To improve the situation, the government should ease the licensing policy and consider a friendlier framework towards setting up of F&amp;B establishments in UP, predominantly in Lucknow.” The organisation then pointed to another survey it had commissioned, in which it found 35% respondents faced challenges in purchasing liquor due to inadequate outlets, many of which were located in dingy, unsafe areas. NRAI president Anurag Katriar, said: “The lack of awareness may be seen as a key impediment to the creation of a responsible drinking culture in India.” "
Lucknow,UP: Blue and white uniform to replace khaki for traffic cops,"LUCKNOW: In a repeat of what happened during the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) regime, traffic police personnel in the entire state will don dark blue pants instead of khaki ones from Sunday. Senior officials in the police department said that the aim is to bring uniformity as traffic cops in other states—such as Maharashtra and Delhi—have a dress code of white shirt and dark blue trousers. ASP (traffic) Lucknow Purnendu Singh said a consensus on change in uniform was reached in October while two months were given for preparation of the new uniform. He said the new dress code was for all traffic sub-inspectors as well as traffic inspectors across the state. Then CM-Mayawati had changed the uniform of traffic police from white to blue on April 1, 2008, stating that white gets dirty easily. However, in 2012, the Samajwadi Party reversed the move alleging that the colour blue was similar to the uniform of BSP volunteers and added that a unanimous decision was taken by a committee to withdraw the blue colour as it made traffic cops appear like private security guards.

Lucknow,"Will discuss idea of cow safari in UP with chief minister Yogi Adityanath, says dairy minister","LUCKNOW: As the state continues to face a stray cattle crisis, minister for dairy development Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary has floated the idea of making cattle safaris in UP. While reviewing preparations to keep stray cattle warm and safe in shelters this winter, the minister told officials of his department to identify large tracts of land where stray cattle can be allowed to roam freely. “These areas can be developed as safaris later on, like the one in Mathura where cattle are kept but not tied up and lots of people go and visit them. I will be discussing the plan with chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday,” Chaudhary said. Despite various deadlines set by the CM, the government has not been able to shift all stray cattle to shelters being constructed across the state. In fact, the minister was reportedly highly upset at the “slow pace of work” in construction of cow shelters and in implementation of various government schemes in which farmers and others have been asked to come forward and adopt stray cattle. Asking nodal officers to inspect cow shelters between December 5 and 10, the minister added that medicines and fodder should be arranged for in sufficient quantity. "

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Women convicts seek legal aid, bail","LUCKNOW: The women convicts lodged in Nari Bandi Griha got a rare opportunity to put up their long-pending demands with a top official and they sought legal aid and assistance in bail when additional chief secretary (home, jail administration &amp; reform) Awanish Awasthi reached Lucknow jail early morning on Sunday for a surprise inspection. A woman inmate from Gwalior, convicted in a kidnapping case, said she had got bail long ago, but there was no one to furnish surety for her release. “The woman said both her daughters are blind and there was no one to sign bond or furnish surety for her bail. We will ensure she gets bail in two-three days,” Awasthi told TOI later. Another woman convict sought free legal aid, while others shared their family problems and urged for help in some form. “I instructed jail officials to provide good environment for women convicts’ children who are keen to study, besides providing toys and park for them,” he added. Earlier, the sudden arrival of Awasthi at Lucknow prison around 8.15am sent officials in a tizzy. Many officials were caught unaware and came to know about the visit only when he had already arrived for inspection. Awasthi went straight to Lucknow district jail and inspected arrangements for two hours before proceeding to Nari Bandi Griha. Lucknow jail is a cluster of three jails —Lucknow district jail, Adarsh jail, and Nari Bandi Griha. Awasthi made a number of recommendations after the inspection. He asked officials to arrange digital X-ray and ultrasound machines since inmates had to be taken to hospitals for it. He ordered upgrading of surveillance by increasing number of CCTVs from 54 in entire premises to 200, besides improving video conferencing facility. He told officials to prepare a detailed proposal for solar power plant and sewerage in consultation with UP Nirman Nigam and a plan for garbage disposal and send them to government. He also directed the DM and senior jail superintendent to consult experts for sewage treatment plant. He also sought a report on shortage of manpower. "

The doctor called my daughter for treatment and demanded more money every time. When I found out that he couldn’t resolve my daughter’s problem, I visited his clinic and had a heated argument with him, she said. She further added, “On Saturday, he barged into my house with a knife and attacked me. When Guddu came to rescue me, he first threw the puppy and strangled it with his feet. We made several appeals to the man to remove his feet, but in vain.” “The accused also touched me inappropriately and tried to kill me and my daughter,” she said. “Three persons were passing by my house gate and heard our alarm. They came and caught the accused. We then called the police,” she added.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Pistol goes missing from RPF armoury, finger at constable","LUCKNOW: A 9mm pistol has gone missing from the RPF armoury in Lucknow division of Northern Railway, prompting the in-charge to accuse a constable of laxity. According to complainant and RPF head constable Jai Prakash Yadav, constable Ram Lakhan Prajapati who is deployed at the cash guard in Alambagh checked the pistol around 9.30am on November 29 and later put it inside the armoury. “Since I was deployed outside the cash guard on November 28 and 29, Prajapati had keys to the armoury. On November 30, he returned the keys. Around 2pm the same day, I found the pistol missing despite the armoury being locked,” Yadav said in the FIR registered at Alambagh police station. Station house officer AK Shahi said a case had been registered against the RPF constable based on the complaint. “We will summon him (Prajapati) to the thana and get his statement recorded,” the officer said. “Missing of a licensed pistol is no ordinary crime. It can be used by outlaws. Security arrangements at the RPF armoury will be checked during investigation of the case. We will also speak to senior officers,” Shahi added. While senior RPF officers evaded questions from reporters, sources said the armoury did not have an electronic surveillance system. “There are no CCTV cameras and hence, the RPF is clueless about what happened to the pistol and how,” a source said.

Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh assembly speaker backs reforms for house decorum,"LUCKNOW: UP assembly speaker Hridaya Narain Dikshit expressed concern on the decline in standard of debates in legislature and urged political parties to introspect and cooperate for improvement. Presiding over the maiden meeting of the committee for recommending reforms for productive and peaceful functioning of Parliament, state assemblies and legislative councils, Dikshit said instead of improving standard of debates and legislative work, the institutions were heading towards decline. “We see that some members misuse this pious platform and indulge in theatrics to score points for political benefit. There are stringent laws to deal with such situations, but it would be better if things improve though introspection,” said Dikshit, while referring to disruption of governor’s addresses by throwing paper balls and missiles towards the chair. “I am pained to say that some members come prepared from home to create ruckus in the House. This has to be stopped,” he said, adding that he would soon consult other speakers to prepare a report on reforms. “Even name shaming and suspension of members is not proving to be a deterrent,” said Dikshit, who himself faced a bizarre situation in last session when the Opposition boycotted the proceedings and held a parallel House outside. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had constituted a high-powered committee under the chairmanship of Dikshit, and comprising speakers of six other assemblies, including Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, to submit recommendations for improving the standard of debates and reforms in functioning and rules.

Lucknow,Vibrant Bundelkhand meet to wow India Inc,"LUCKNOW: After Vibrant Gujarat and Vibrant Goa, now Uttar Pradesh is set to promote one of its most backward regions under the banner of Vibrant Bundelkhand. The summit, expected to be held in the second half of 2020, will bring NRIs, industrialists and technical experts to Jhansi where they will discuss ways to increase investments in the area and revive flailing industries. The programme will be organised by an independent trust, which includes Bundelkhand Development Board vice-chairperson Raja Bundela. The Vibrant India Foundation, which was instrumental in organising Vibrant Gujarat, has already carried out a preliminary study of the area to identify sectors which need assistance. “The Vibrant Bundelkhand Trust has applied for registration. There are 11 members in it. I got in touch with Jagat Shah, the founder trustee of Vibrant India Foundation, and his team has already started ground work for it,” said Bundela, who said he got the idea for the summit from Vibrant Goa. Manoj Rastogi, the other founder trustee of Vibrant India Foundation, told TOI that in its initial research, the organisation found that despite its image as a backward area, Bundelkhand has tremendous scope for development. “For instance, the area is known as a water-scarce region but Telangana has much less water and is much superior industrially. We have to focus on areas like capacity building for youth, creating market for local skills, ensuring better connectivity and tapping potential sectors where revival is possible,” he said. Sectors where the Trust has found scope for development include fisheries, goat rearing, connectivity, food processing, granite mining and tourism, among others. Bundela said that a key component of the Trust’s system of drawing investment is by tapping NRIs from the region. “For this summit, we will identify industries that are not doing well but which have scope for revival. The role of NRIs from Bundelkhand will then be to help either financially or technically and the Trust will act as a mediator between the government and the individual. Some of these industries include the paper industry of Kalpi, a glass factory started by former PM Rajiv Gandhi, chanderi saris,” Bundela said. Jhansi is the likely venue for the summit since no other place will have either enough space to host a conference and exhibition, nor sufficient room to house guests. “Jhansi is approachable both by rail and road. We have to think about air connectivity for the region before we can imagine good development for it,” Bundela said. "

All the pass outs of National School of Drama have started an organisation and do plays over there. I did that for about 5 years until I was 18.” — Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,Who will build Ram Temple? Two Hindu bodies in war of words,"LUCKNOW: Even as several Muslim litigants have decided to move the Supreme Court seeking a review petition on the November 9 Ramjanmabhoomi title suit judgment, a war of words has erupted between two prominent Hindu trusts on leading the Ram Temple construction. On one side is Varanasi-based Ramalya Trust, which includes Ramlalla Virajmaan head priest Satyendra Das as member, and on the other is VHP-backed Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas.  Ramalya Trust has already roped in a Tamil Nadu-based artist to construct a 20x20foot gold-plated wooden temple for the Ramjanmabhoomi site. Since 1992, Das has been the caretaker priest of the makeshift temple, working on the directions of the Allahabad high court. Ramalya Trust also has 13 mahamandaleshwars of various akharas and four Shankaracharyas as its members. Ramalya Trust secretary Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati has now written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to intervene and insist that the VHP-backed Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas is not given the opportunity to construct the temple. ""We will not accept the VHP model as it was created before the Ayodhya Act, 1993. Our temple height will be 1,008 feet as compared to their model's which is just 160 feet. Our temple will be made out of gold. Our letter has cited these reasons,"" said Saraswati. Meanwhile, Janmabhoomi Nyas, which also runs a karyashala where more than a lakh stones are lying, has now said it will not allow Ramalya Trust to place any such temple or idol at the site. ""Ramalya Trust is a private body. It cannot have any bearing on the new trust that will be formed after the Supreme Court's order.

Lucknow,"UP: Ayodhya to be Ikshvakupuri, plan for spiritual eco-city","LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government is planning to set up a spiritual eco-city in Ayodhya that will have vedic centres for religious ceremonies, a large forest cover and fountains. The construction, however, will be limited to only 5% of the 1,800- acre site earmarked on the banks of Saryu river. The township is likely to be named Ikshvakupuri after the Ikshvaku dynasty whose prominent rulers included Raja Dashrath, Raja Harishchandra, Raja Raghu, Raja Bhaghirath, and the first five tirthankars (according to Jain genealogy). The project is likely to cost more than Rs 2,000 crore. The entry to the township will be restricted to spiritual backpackers, who want to pursue research in Vedic culture, study the Ramayana, take meditation classes with recital of Upanishads and vedas. ""The courses could be free as well as paid though it will be decided later. Stays for spiritual backpackers will be limited,"" said a top government official.  The project, based on the pattern of Angkor Wat temple complex in Siem Reap of Cambodia, will be developed by the state housing department that operates under the chief minister as well as urban development bodies that come under cabinet minister Ashutosh Tandon. The forest cover, originally part of the Valmiki Ramyana, will be developed with tree patches like Dandkaranya, Vindhyaranya, Dhamraranya and Vedaranya. Two sarovar (lakes), Pampa and Naryana, will be developed as water bodies. The township, that will start from Ayodhya-Gonda highway and culminate on Guptar Ghat, will also have a riverfront, measuring 3km from the Ramjanmabhoomi site. ""The built-up area, including all complexes, will be acquired from the forest and horticulture departments as well as defunct government properties,"" said a top official in the CM's office.

""There will be a direct access to the Ramjanmabhoomi site. However, only people on foot will be allowed. No vehicles will pass by,"" said an official.

Lucknow,Officials to lose part of salary if stubble burning continues in UP,"LUCKNOW: Officials under whose watch stubble burning will take place are likely to lose a part of their salary. Chief secretary RK Tiwari on Monday said that if an FIR is not filed against an accused responsible for crop burning, action would also be initiated against the revenue and senior police official of the area. The CS spoke to all divisional commissioners, district magistrates and senior officials of the agriculture department through video conferencing on Monday and said that strict action should be initiated against officials if crop burning does not stop immediately. UP, along with Haryana and Punjab, was recently pulled up by the Supreme Court for having failed to stop stubble burning in their respective states as the act had led to a massive spike in air pollution levels. ""The CS said that if any report of stubble burning is received now, the DM and the police officer concerned of the area will be held responsible. Officials held guilty of having failed to prevent stubble burning will lose a part of their salary as penalty,"" said a senior official. Giving directions that crop stubble should be used as fodder in cow shelters or converted to compost in specially dug compost pits, the CS has asked DMs of areas where stubble burning is on to give him a ground report by 12noon on Tuesday. On Saturday, Tiwari had issued a show-cause notice to DMs of 24 districts over a high number of stubble burning cases. He has asked them to respond to this notice by Wednesday. In the notice, Tiwari has asked the DMs to detail what action has been taken against officials under whose watch stubble burning has continued, and sought explanation by local tehsil and police on what action they have taken in such cases. The CS has also assessed the safety conditions in Navodaya, Kasturba and Ashram schools in the light of the death of a 17-year-old girl of class XI on September 16 in her school's hostel room in Bhogaon area of Mainpuri. The CS said that in schools and hostels which house girl students, a strict watch should be kept on those coming and going, such as visitors and workers. "
Lucknow,"AQI goes north, smog to cloak Lucknow again","LUCKNOW: The perils of pollution are far from over for the city. The air quality index (AQI), which had plummeted to a ‘moderate’ 180 last week, climbed 57 notches in four days to become a ‘poor’ 237 on Monday. The concentration of superfine particulate matter in the air will continue to increase in coming days, courtesy drop in temperatures and favourable conditions for fog. Lucknow had grappled with very high levels of pollution (AQI 350-430) in the first half of November. It witnessed interim relief towards the end of that month, with light rainfall and gusts of wind dragging the AQI to below 200. However, dipping temperatures and moderate fog in the morning hours are once again triggering a thin layer of smog, which weathermen believe will become thicker as the days and nights become colder. “At present, the drop in temperatures is gradual. The same is converting moisture in the air into fog at night and in the morning. This fog is combining with particulate matter from (vehicular/industrial) emissions to cause smog,” said professor Dhruvsen Singh, the director Lucknow University’s climate and air quality monitoring cell. Singh maintained that higher wind velocity was clearing smog during the day. “As a result, the AQI, which is a reflection of air quality a city witnesses in 24 hours, is rising gradually but is still below the 300 mark,” he said. The professor, nevertheless, predicted further drop in temperatures and dense smog that even gusts of wind might find difficult to blow away. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Flights grounded, flyers' tempers fly","LUCKNOW: As fog continued to hit flight operations, heated arguments between passengers and staff of airlines were witnessed over delay in arrival and departure of flights at Chaudhary Charan Singh Amausi airport on Monday. Several flights including Lucknow-Delhi G8211 GoAir (three hours), Jaipur-Lucknow AI9691 Air India (two hours), AI621 Mumbai-Lucknow (40 minutes), G8558 Hyderabad-Lucknow GoAir (three hours) and G8110 Ahmedabad-Lucknow GoAir (four hours) arrived late due to which their departure was also delayed. Passengers got agitated when an announcement was made that a flight, which was cancelled on Sunday and rescheduled for Monday morning, would arrive late by three hours due to foggy weather in Delhi. Some of the passengers who had important work in Delhi approached airline staff demanding that compensation should be paid to passengers if a flight was delayed, rescheduled or cancelled as per the ""passenger charter"" released by the government of India. The conversation soon snowballed into a heated exchange when the staff called security personnel to stop passengers. People objected to the intervention and said they were airing their grievances but were treated unfairly. Shikhar Kishore, a passenger, said he had booked a ticket for Sunday but his flight was rescheduled for Monday. ""I will miss an important meeting in Delhi. Who will pay for the loss? "" he added. Spokesperson of the airline said, ""Weather, runway maintenance and flight duty time limitations (FDTL) are the major factors which are causing delay. All passengers were taken care of and served refreshments."" Officer on special duty (OSD), Airport Authority of India, Sanjay K Narayan said: ""Foggy conditions in other parts of the country were primarily responsible for delay in flight operations. Everything was fine at Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport."" "
Lucknow,How social media is turning ‘quiet’ homemakers into assertive feminists,"LUCKNOW: Thanks to the ‘leisure’ time they spend on social media, homemakers today are not only more aware of political and feminist issues, but are also articulating their views more confidently. The exposure has connected them with like-minded people from across the globe. Also, they are asserting more within family and taking an active part in decisions which affect their and their kids’ lives. This was the conclusion several scholars drew in research papers presented on the first day of a conference on ‘Leisure and Social Development in the Post-Modern era – Contemporary Issues and Challenges’, organised by the sociology department of Lucknow University on Monday. A faculty member of Jawaharlal Nehru University’s sociology department Neelika Mehrotra elucidated the point with the help of a case study based on two closed Facebook groups for women — ‘Sari Speak’ and ‘Unleash’. Both the groups had lakhs of followers and most of them were homemakers. “After joining the groups, the women initially discussed more about dresses and culture, but gradually some of them started creating subgroups to discuss political affairs and feminist issues,” she added. “For example, in one of the groups, the women started communicating on small issues like how to wear saris in different traditional ways and later the discussions moved to social and political topics like gender discrimination at workplace, dowry and women representation in politics,” Mehrotra said. A research scholar from LU Zia Jafri in her study said that homemakers hardly get any free time. Earlier, whatever little time they got, they spent most of it watching TV. “However, now they spend more time checking out their Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp accounts than watching television. They are well versed with all that’s happening around the world and freely take part in discussions, which in turn boosts their confidence,” she added. “I came across several examples where women earlier used to follow their husbands when it came to a simple task of selecting a destination for a vacation, but now through social media they know more about tourist places and take lead in deciding the venue. Similarly, there were cases where a homemaker stood by the choice of her daughter to pursue an unconventional career against the wishes of the husband,” Jafri added. "
Lucknow,Working with both Hrithik &amp; Katrina had been a lovely experience: John Pasley,"A scientist by profession, England born John Pasley debuted as an actor in Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif starrer hit film, Bang Bang. Although he has been frequently visiting India, this was his first trip to Lucknow. John who played the role of a police officer in the film, visited the city for 12th international conference on plasma science and application. His journey from a scientist to an actor in itself is an unprecedented story. As he exclaimed, “In order to attend a conference, I had come to Mumbai in the year 2012. In the evening, wearing the Mumbai Indians jersey while on my way to attend the 20-20 cricket match, this guy comes up to me and starts talking. Turned out he was a manager in a company that dealt with foreign talents. Later, I was given the role of a police officer in a hit commercial film in the year 2014.” Speaking about his experience on the sets of Bang Bang, John stated, “Working with both Hrithik and Katrina had been a lovely experience. They are extremely talented and hard-working. Although I saw the two regularly, the only star I really talked much with was Danny Denzongpa, who is very easy to interact with.” When asked about who he is looking forward to work with, John’s eyes gleamed and with a smile, he said, “There are quite a few actors I have always enjoyed watching on screen. When I was a kid I used to enjoy watching Amitabh Bachchan very much, I still enjoy watching his films. He is also one of the first actors I was aware of in Bollywood. I also like Madhuri Dixit, Priyanka Chopra, Aamir Khan, Sharukh Khan, quite many of them. I would love to work with Amitabh Bachchan and Priyanka Chopra.” John Pasley (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) John Pasley (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Calling acting a mere hobby, John said, “I really enjoy acting and would like to do it again. For one thing, I’m not really a great actor and definitely not a great dancer, neither a singer nor a fighter. So that rules me out of many roles.” Unlike many westerners, John enjoys spicy food. “I love Indian food. I’m from England and there are many restaurants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. But anyway I have been eating Indian food from quite an early age. One of the type of Indian cuisine which is not so common in the UK is South Indian food. I very much like dosas. However, I like all kinds of Indian food. Other than dosas, I like Hyderabadi biryani which I’ve had many times in Hyderabad.” Despite the fact that acting is his hobby, John is looking forward to working in new movies and with new co-stars. — Yashi Agarwal and Swarnima Upadhyaya "

Lucknow,All India Muslim Personal Law Board sticks to Rajeev Dhavan’s leadership,"LUCKNOW: All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has said it would “continue to work under Rajeev Dhavan’s esteemed leadership,” as has been the case since 1993. The board said it would file its review petition on Ayodhya verdict after Dhavan’s stamp of approval. “Rajeev Dhavan has been a symbol of justice and unity,” said board secretary and spokesperson, Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani. While Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind filed its review plea in SC on Monday, AIMPLB is scheduled to file its petition through individual Muslim litigants based in Ayodhya. An AIMPLB press statement issued on behalf of general secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani, praised Dhavan for courageously and honestly representing Muslim parties in Supreme Court, despite threats and malicious campaigns against him. “The way he argued the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmbhoomi title suit is praiseworthy. He was abused by a section of people and a filthy campaign was launched in social media, but nothing could deter him. AIMPLB and Muslim community hold him (Dhavan) in highest regard. He has put his heart and soul in this case. The community shall always be indebted to him and assist him in supporting secular values,” the AIMPLB statement said. A team of senior advocates and advocates, including Yusuf Muchala, Zafaryab Jilani, MR Shamshad, Shakeel A Syed, Irshad Ahmad, Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, Nizam Pasha and Tahir Hakeem are currently drafting the review plea on AIMPLB’s behalf. “The draft review petition will then be ‘settled’ (approved) by Rajeev Dhavan,” the board said.

Lucknow,KBC fastest-finger-first move behind Jamiat review hurry?,"LUCKNOW: Was it Kaun Banega Crorepati’s ‘fastest-finger-first’ effect that had the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind hurry into filing a review petition in Supreme Court on its verdict on the Ayodhya issue? UP Jamiat head Maulana Ashhad Rashidi had told TOI on Sunday evening that the body, which is a petitioner in the Ayodhya dispute, had decided to file the review petition on December 6. It instead went ahead and filed it on Monday, December 2. Sources told TOI that senior counsel for Muslim parties Rajeev Dhavan’s inputs for the review draft were also ignored in the final plea document. A day later, this seems to have triggered a storm as Dhavan announced on social media that he was “sacked by Jamiat advocate-on-record Ejaz Maqbool” and that he would “no longer (be) involved in the review or the case.” Sources privy to the case told TOI, soon after Dhavan’s post on social media went viral, that the seeming urgency in filing the review petition resembled the process of selection in the popular TV game show Kaun Banega Crorepati, where the fastest contestant to answer gets to be on the hot seat. Sources also revealed that Dhavan had earlier met Jamiat members and lawyers twice in Delhi to hammer out the review plea draft. A third meeting between the two was to be held on Monday. However, sources claimed Jamiat national president Arshad Madani decided to go ahead with the plea on Monday itself, which meant the petition filed in SC on Monday was not “settled” by senior most advocate Dhavan. In legal parlance, “settled” means a draft should have the final stamp of approval from the senior-most counsel before being filed. Elements of the draft, which had Dhavan’s sanction, were then not entered into the final review plea filed in court. His name was also removed from the plea, following Jamiat’s desire to file the plea on Monday itself, before anyone else did. Sources claimed that Dhavan had a dental emergency on Monday but Jamiat went ahead with the filing of the plea. An insider to the legal case also claimed Jamiat has, in the past, openly talked about how it was the first to have filed a review of Allahabad high court’s order in 2010, which had asked for division of the disputed land into three parts. “Any plea, not drafted well enough to stand ground, could have weakened the Muslim stand or even got the plea dismissed. Jamiat, convinced of the grounds prepared by its lawyers, may have wanted to pre-empt any such happening and hence went ahead, even if it meant not getting its senior counsel’s stamp of approval,” said an insider privy to what transpired between Sunday and Monday. Even after repeated attempts made by TOI to reach out to Jamiat’s press secretary Fazlur Rahman Qasmi through calls and messages, there was no response from the organization on it. "
Lucknow,CBDT seeks recusal of CAT member to avoid prejudice,"LUCKNOW: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Tuesday moved an application with the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), seeking recusal of its judicial member in the Lucknow bench, Jasmine Ahmad, from hearing cases related to Captain Pramod Kumar Bajaj, who was compulsorily retired from the post of income tax commissioner on September 27. The hearing is scheduled for December 5. CBDT is also planning to file an application for transfer of the case from CAT’s Lucknow bench to its principal bench in Delhi. In the application submitted through income tax officer (legal cell) Ankit Tiwari, CBDT stated it recently learned that judicial member Jasmine Ahmad is the secretary of a trust, registered as Wisdom World, to which Captain Bajaj had granted approval under Section 80G(5) (VI) of Income Tax Act on July 7 — the day he was suspended. The IT Section allows tax deduction on donations made to the trust. “Since the original application challenging the suspension order along with other orders passed against Captain Bajaj is being heard in the tribunal by Jasmine Ahmad, she should recuse herself from the case to avoid prejudice,” the application stated. Captain Bajaj was suspended on July 1 after he was charged with bigamy and filing multiple cases and attending hearings in Allahabad high court and CAT, without seeking leave from the department. He was also charged with not disclosing the purchase of a flat worth Rs 70-80 lakh in Delhi "
Lucknow,"Well-off people of Lucknow holiday abroad for clean air, safety: Survey","Lucknow: Economically well-off people of Lucknow prefer to spend their vacations abroad because they feel that quality of life in terms of pollution, road and women’s safety, traffic snarls and civic conditions are better in developed countries than in India. This was revealed in a study conducted by the department of sociology of Lucknow University (LU) and tabled in the ongoing international conference on ‘leisure and social development in the post-modern era - contemporary issues and challenges’. The event is hosted by the sociology department. The middle and lower-middle classes prefer to utilise leisure time by going for pilgrimages or to hill stations. For the study, researchers led by Prof Sukant Chaudhary surveyed 100 city-based families of different income groups. “We found that people of Lucknow are multitasking and hardly get time for leisure. Whenever they get an opportunity, they prefer to go out of the city or state. Those who can afford it prefer developed countries. The primary reasons were, people said, that they, especially women, could roam around freely without prying eyes. Fresh air was another important reason. People also said places were clean, traffic was orderly and the number of road accidents was low,” said Prof Chaudhary. “Those who preferred pilgrimages said that the prime motivating factor was clean environment, fresh air and mental peace they felt in these places. I came around cases where people who couldn’t afford to go outside went to Neemsar in Sitapur or any nearby pilgrimage as they found that the environment there was more congenial than in Lucknow,” he added. Prof Chaudhary also conducted a similar study among people of Berhampur in Odisha. In contrast to Lucknow, there, he said, people preferred to visit places within the state. The reason, he added, was that they felt Odisha has clean, not polluted, had good road connectivity and was safe. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow to expand, 88 new villages under LMC wings","LUCKNOW: The city’s population will now have more space to live and breathe. Reason: Its area has expanded by 56% with the inclusion of 88 villages under the jurisdiction of Lucknow Municipal Corporation. The decision approved by the UP cabinet on Tuesday would bring down the population density from 8,000 persons per sq km at present to around 5,600 persons per sq km. The last expansion of LMC limit was done in 2009. Now, more land would be available to civic agencies and authorities to undertake housing, commercial and development projects in accommodate the increasing urban population, said additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh. Also, people living in localities in the rural belt — where urbanisation begun in recent years with coming up of several educational, housing and industrial projects — will get services provided by LMC, LDA and urban development department, Singh added. The proposal was passed by the LMC in 2014 and sent to the state government in 2016. These villages had already been brought under jurisdiction of the LDA in September last year. According to 2011 Census and LMC records, around 67% people of Lucknow district live in the city. In 2009-11, the population of Lucknow district was around 45 lakh including 28.2 lakh residents in the city under LMC. The district’s population increased to around 50 lakh in 2018-19, including 35 lakh in the city. The rate of population growth in the city was 25% in the last decade. “The city population swelled at a faster rate because of multiplication as well as migration from the parts of the state,” said a town planner associated with LMC. Since 2009, the area under LMC was 402.65 sqkm. The inclusion of 88 villages has added population of around 17,000 and area has increased to around 229 sq km. “This means that population within new city limits will increase to 35.17 lakh and total area under Lucknow Municipal Corporation to 631 sqkm, which will bring down population density from 8,000 persons per sqkm at present to around 5,600 persons per sqkm,” said an Lucknow Municipal Corporation official.

But not only that, the people are so welcoming, the hospitality has been second to none. I’ve never been fed so much in my life and such delicious Indian food. I’m very sad that I have to go back to the United Kingdom because Indian food is not the same where I live in South Wales. It’s not as good as real Indian food that we have here in India,"" said Emma while having some Indian snacks at the café.

Lucknow,"Build airport away from Taj, SC tells Centre","NEW DELHI: To protect the Taj Mahal from pollution that would arise from increased air traffic facilitated by the proposed expansion of Agra airport, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the Centre must plan a bigger airport away from Agra and ferry passengers to the heritage city by “more excellent trains like the Palace on Wheels”. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant appeared to agree with environmental lawyer M C Mehta’s objection to expansion of Agra airport, which he said would increase the number of aircraft leading to more pollution. However, appearing for Airports Authority of India, senior advocate Ajit Sinha said it wanted to build an additional terminal to provide better facilities to passengers. While maintaining that it prima facie did not see any reason not to grant permission for construction of an additional terminal, the bench said, “It might be difficult to permit an increase in air traffic. We, therefore, consider it appropriate to direct the Union government to consider an alternative site in such anticipatory increase in traffic where the aircraft could operate from.” Additional solicitor general A S Nadkarni said the Centre would request the court to consider increasing air traffic only after conducting a study. Nearly seven million tourists, including a million foreigners, visited the Taj Mahal in 2018-19. The bench said, “We are informed that the railways can provide more excellent trains like the ‘Palace on Wheels’ and such trains could be employed to transport passengers from the new airfield to the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ), Agra. The Union government will also consider involving the railways to solve the problems of anticipated increase in tourists and bear in mind the fact that it will serve nobody’s interest to have the area polluted, with resultant damage to people and the heritage monuments.” It said it would consider the interim prayer for restraining the Centre from allowing increase in air traffic to Agra after the Union government filed its report in January on completion of the study. Senior advocate Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation Ltd, sought permission for starting Metro services within Agra. The bench referred the plea for examination to the Central Empowered Committee (CEC), which will look into its impact on the environment and the Taj Mahal. The SC asked the CEC to submit its report in four weeks. "
Kanpur,50 student deaths on IIT campuses in five years,"CHENNAI: Fifty students have died on IIT campuses in the last five years — most were suicides recorded as ‘death under suspicious circumstances’ by police. IIT Guwahati tops the list with 14 deaths while IIT Madras and IIT Bombay saw seven deaths each, Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank told Parliament in his reply to a question from N K Premachandran. The Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) MP had asked about the number of suspicious deaths at premier institutes in connection with the suicide of Fathima Latheef, a first-year MA student at IIT Madras, on November 8. The minister also stated that the MHRD had received representations from several MPS for an investigation into the suicide.  After a spike in suicides at IITs six years ago, the MHRD had formed a committee headed by IIT Kanpur former chairman M Anandakrishnan to probe the causes of the deaths. The committee found that many students are unable to cope with the academic pressure in IITs. One of the important recommendations of the committee was to strengthen the counselling services for the students, Anandakrishnan told TOI. “Students with early warning signs should be identified and counselled. Students from vulnerable groups need to be protected,” he said. The committee also suggested ‘relative grading’ be replaced with ‘absolute marks’ to reduce academic stress. “In our study, we found that most of the suicides have happened in the first 18 months. After getting appreciated everywhere for their academic achievements, they found it hard to cope with the fact their academic performance is ‘not good enough’,” says Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar, founder of Sneha, a suicide prevention organisation and also part of the committee formed by MHRD. She said students from rural areas, those with poor language ability and poor social skills are the most vulnerable. "
Lucknow,Dhavan fought despite death threats: Jamiat,"Lucknow: Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan fought on the Muslim side ignoring death threats and mental torture that came his way in pursuit of the Ayodhya case, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind has said, following a controversy around reports that the Supreme Court advocate was first allegedly ‘sacked’ and then ‘re-instated’ as Jamiat’s advocate. Jamiat also said that Dhavan was still its advocate in the SC and any future legal step in the Ayodhya review plea will only be taken after Dhavan’s advice. In a press statement, Jamiat said that its president Maulana Arshad Madani and Dhavan had never met or spoken directly on the phone. Advocate-on-record Ejaz Maqbool was the only point of contact between them. It also added that Madani was willing to apologize to Dhavan in person to dispel any misunderstanding. “Maulana Madani is in Deoband and will be reaching Delhi on Thursday. We will then make efforts to approach Rajeev Dhavan directly so that the issue is resolved, if that is needed,” Jamiat’s legal cell secretary Ghulam Ahmad Azmi told TOI. Azmi had issued a statement to media late Tuesday on behalf of Madani which said Maqbool was the advocate-on- record for Jamiat during the Ayodhya case and when the review plea was filed. “However, this does not mean Dhavan was removed by Jamiat. On Monday, when the review plea was filed, I was informed by Maqbool that Dhavan was at the dentist’s and the same was told to the press. It was not said he was taken off the case because of ill health. I have written no letter or email to him saying this,” said Madani in a statement. “Dhavan had to undergo imental torture and face death threats, but he continued to uphold the beacon of secularism, not caring for his life,” the statement read.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Two-month-old girl found dumped in Mawaiyya bush,"LUCKNOW: A two-month-old baby girl was found abandoned in a bush by the road in Mawaiyya (Alambagh) on Wednesday morning. This is the sixth girl among 11 newborn babies found abandoned in and around the city this year. In 2018, 11 newborns—seven of them were girls—were found. The figure in 2017 was 13 with five girls. According to Childline 1098, the girl was found by a sweeper around 6am near a medical shop lying in a bush, wrapped in a sweater and a shawl. The sweeper informed the police and an ambulance took the baby girl to a government hospital. Doctors said the baby was healthy. Childline volunteers later took the baby to the district child welfare committee, a quasi-judicial body, which directed that she be admitted to a government orphanage on Prag Narain Road. “The baby girl was found crying and there was nobody nearby. Police are trying to track down her parents. Till then, the child will stay at the orphanage. If her parents are not found, the baby girl will be given up for adoption after two months,” said Krishna Pratap Sharma of Childline. "
Lucknow,Private bus strike leaves hundreds stranded; fares of radio cabs surge,"By: Akshata MishraLUCKNOW: Tanushree Chatterjee, a student of IT College, had a harrowing time on Wednesday morning. With private bus drivers on strike, the 18-year-old was late by 15 minutes for her examination despite leaving her Vineet Khand residence an hour in advance. As autorickshaws and e-rickshaws were also full, she had to hire an app-based cab, but was shocked to see that the fare had shot up by around 30%. Around 12,600 buses authorised by the state transport corporation ply in the city. Of these, 470 buses run by private players have been off the roads for three days due to a strike by drivers and conductors demanding salary hike. These buses ferry around 10,000 people daily. As a result, hundreds were stranded, trying to catch other modes of transport. No relief is likely in the coming days as drivers and conductors have announced they will not resume work till their demands are met. Harassment of commuters due to the strike has been compounded by fare hike by autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and app cabs. “I paid Rs 175 to a cab from my residence in Viram Khand to office in Hazratganj. On normal days, the fare is around Rs 130,” said Poonam, who works in a private firm. “Cabs are cashing in by charging 30-40% more than the normal fare,” said Sachin, a student who was forced to pay double the amount for a 2km ride from Lalbagh to Sapru Marg to reach his coaching institute. Some people also complained that a few autorickshaw drivers were not ready to take multiple passengers at a time. “Instead, they insisted that individual customers book the entire autorickshaw, paying several times more than the normal fare,” said Jai Prakash. “We don’t know when the strike will end. One can pay extra for a day or two but not regularly,” said Ritu, a government employee. RK Mandal, president of the city bus operators’ association, said that bus owners are trying to settle the matter as early as possible. "
Lucknow,"Technology, pink police outposts to make Lucknow safer for women","LUCKNOW: Hi-tech security arrangements, pink police outposts and women cops on patrol duty in pink vehicles are set to make Lucknow safer for women. With an average of seven criminal cases being reported every day and the city topping in crime against women among 19 cities having population of 20 lakh or more, the government is planning to use police force and technology to improve law and order situation under the ‘safe city project’. ADG Women Powerline-1090 Anju Gupta said under the project, to be supported by Nirbhaya Fund, 1,500 CCTV cameras will be connected to an Integrated Smart Control Room (ISCR) for live monitoring. ADG, WPL-1090, will be the nodal in charge of the project. “A total of Rs 67.75 crore has been disbursed by the government for a control room at reserve police lines. CCTV cameras will be installed on stretches which are prone to incidents of crime against women. These crime ‘hotspots’ will be geo-tagged on Google Maps and will be displayed on patrol vehicles for quick response,” the ADG said. Gupta said as many as 100 pink booths, to be managed by women cops, would be created in crime-prone areas. Patrolling in these localities will be conducted by women cops. “An amount of Rs 2.45 crore is being utilised for integration of WPL 1090 and UP 112. An additional Rs 20 crore will be spent on construction of another floor at WPL-1090 office by the Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam. Expansion of WPL is being carried out to increase the capacity of receiving calls. At least 80 terminals will be added to the existing facility with 200 staff. A total of Rs 5 crore will be spent on training and awareness programmes for women,” she said. The Centre had allocated Rs 194.44 crore for the project in November 2018. The project will be implemented as a centrally-sponsored scheme with the Centre funding 60% of the project and the remaining will be borne by the state government. "
Lucknow,"After BIS survey, Lucknow Municipal Corporation ups water purification budget by Rs 2.25 crore","LUCKNOW: After a survey by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) revealed that city’s tap water is unfit for drinking, Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), in its revised budget for 2019-20, has increased allocation for purification of drinking water by Rs 2.25 crore for remaining four months of this financial year. The allocation, which has been increased from Rs 7.05 crore to Rs 9.30 crore, will be used by Jal Sansthan for purchase of chemicals and enhancement of machinery required for chlorination and bleaching of water before supply. The proposal will be placed in the LMC executive meeting on Thursday for its formal stamp. In the BIS survey, city’s water samples were found to be contaminated with harmful bacteria, faeces, metal ions and pesticides which pose threat of diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, skin cancer and kidney failure. TOI had carried reports highlighting how inadequate bleaching, chlorination and leakages in pipelines were contaminating water. The increase in expenditure on water purification will be met by reduction in budget for maintenance of sewage treatment plant from Rs 80 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, sewage pipeline repair from Rs 1.25 crore to Rs 35 lakh and manhole repair from Rs 2 crore to 1 crore. The three activities were handed over to private agencies in August. According to officials, provision for payments to these agencies will be made in 2020-21 budget. "
Lucknow,Vishwa Hindu Parishad seeks verdict feedback from MPs,"LUCKNOW: With Jamiat Ulama-i Hind filing a review petition in the Ayodhya verdict, Vishwa Hindu Parishad has kicked off a campaign to seek opinion of members of Parliament on the SC judgment on Ram temple construction. The campaign, started ahead of the 27th anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition on December 6, is seen as an attempt by the saffron outfit to ramp up the issue before the Centre forms a trust for the construction of Ram temple. The drive began on November 25 and will continue till December 13. “We are taking up the issue with MPs as it is of national importance. The idea is to discuss and seek MPs’ feedback and we will reach out to all MPs cutting across the party lines,” VHP international working president Alok Kumar told TOI. While Kumar said the exact number of MPs contacted would be available after the conclusion of the campaign, VHP sources said the organisation has already spoken to about 200 MPs. “It’s an ongoing process as part of the public relation plan, wherein key aspects of the Ayodhya verdict would be taken up with MPs,” said a senior VHP functionary. The campaign is being spearheaded by VHP’s Sampark Vibhag whose members are meeting MPs in their respective districts. Another issue being discussed in the campaign is the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which proposes to grant citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan if they face religious persecution in their countries, sources said. VHP has also sought MPs’ feedback on special provisions granted to minority educational institutions in recruiting teachers and admitting a certain section of students. “A similar provision should be given to Hindu candidates, said a VHP leader.

Lucknow,"Rae Bareli woman alleges rape, seeks CM Yogi Adityanath’s nod to end life","LUCKNOW: A woman, who alleged gang rape by three men of her village in Rae Bareli district and had moved the court to get an FIR registered, came to hand a petition demanding arrest of the accused or permission to end her life to the chief minister on Wednesday, but was apprehended by police on Kalidas Marg. Talking to reporters, the 30-year-old woman said, “The gang rape case was lodged at Bhadhokhar police station in Rae Bareli 13 months ago, but police did not arrest the named accused. They move freely and issue threats to me and my family. I have stopped going outside as they hurl insulting comments. My husband fell sick because of all this. If the CM cannot provide me justice, he should allow me to end my life.” The woman alleged in her complaint that she was gang-raped by a CRPF jawan and his two unidentified accomplices at gunpoint on October 18, 2018 when she had gone to relieve herself, but FIR was registered on November 1 after court’s intervention. “Police made us do rounds of police station for recording statement, medical test and investigation but did nothing against the accused who still are moving freely,” said her husband. ASP (east) Lucknow, S C Rawat said, “The couple was Stopped from going to CM’s residence. They were carrying a banner with the message, ‘Arrest the accused of gang rape or allow wish death’. The issue has been referred to Rae Bareli police.” When TOI contacted Rae Bareli SP, Swapnil Mamgain, said, “The case is being probed by an ASP rank officer. Investigation revealed an old dispute between the families of the woman and CRPF jawan.” "
Lucknow,"Mainpuri shame: SIT zeroes in on male teacher, student","LUCKNOW: The special investigating team (SIT) probing the mystery death of Class XI girl student of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Mainpuri picked up a male science teacher and a minor classmate of the deceased for questioning on Wednesday. The SIT also met the panel of doctors that conducted the autopsy. SIT members also collected the notebooks, diaries and exercise books of the girl along with her clothes and recorded the statements of 25 students with whom she used to stay in the school. “The names of a male science teacher and a classmate of the victim surfaced during close scrutiny of the notebooks and exercise books recovered from her room. The teacher and student were questioned separately for several hours,” said a source privy to probe. The SIT questioned them about the sequence of events on the fateful day and their activities and presence. “We found some contradictions in answers,” said an officer, but refused to divulge whether the male teacher or minor student was on radar. The SIT had moved a local court on Tuesday seeking permission to hold the lie-detector and polygraph tests of the teacher and student. On Wednesday, the SIT also obtained court permission for lie-detector and polygraph tests of two adults employed in the school and three minors. Soon after getting permission from court, the SIT started the questioning session. The questioning started around 2pm and was in progress at the time of writing of this report. IG (SIT) was himself questioning the five along with the team. The case will be worked purely on the basis of scientific evidence and then corroborated with facts, the SIT said. The mysterious death of the 16-year-old class XI girl had grabbed media attention after Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra shot a letter to the chief minister for investigation in the case on November 30, following which the state government transferred the SP and DM of Mainpuri. The girl’s family had alleged that police was trying to hush up her rape and murder as suicide. "
Kanpur,GSVM first government hospital to get regenerative medicine department,"LUCKNOW: In less than two months from now, GSVM Medical College in Kanpur is set to become the first government hospital in the country to have the department of regenerative medicine. The department will be set up after the college is converted to a super-specialty AIIMS-like institute. The process for it is already underway. Recently, principal of the college Dr Arati Dave Lalchandani had a meeting with Union health minister Dr Harshvardhan to finalise the plan. “We have requested for autonomous institute status. Work is expected to be completed by February,” she said. The chief advisor to the college for the regenerative medicine department is stem cell research and transplant specialist Dr BS Rajput. An alumnus of the college, Dr Rajput has done pioneering work in the field of regenerative medicine using stem cell therapy. “Dr Rajput is not charging any fee for his guidance to the institute. It is his way to give back to his alma mater and to Kanpur. His expertise and international experience will be a blessing for our college,” said Dr Lalchandani. Regenerative medicine can help in treating many incurable diseases as it helps generate new tissue in the body. Any nerve which cannot be sutured or grafted can be generated using stem cell, said neurosurgeon in the college Dr Manish Singh. “With stem cell therapy, it is possible to treat various muscle and cardiac diseases, diabetes and disability. Spinal cord injury, arthritis and motor neurone diseases can also be treated using bone marrow cell transplant and stem cell therapy,” Dr Rajput told TOI during a recent visit to Lucknow. The department will especially benefit patients of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a deadly genetic disorder where 99% children die between age of 13 and 23 years. Dr Rajput is currently trating a patient who is 26 years old by regularly administering stem cells for 5 years. DMD is endemic to eastern UP, specially Azamgarh and Jaunpur and also in adjoining districts of Bihar. “We will also take help from IIT Kanpur for stem cell research. We will imagine and they will manufacture,” said Dr Lalchandani. The consulting agency for the project is Ernst &amp; Young. The estimated cost of Rs 60 crore will be borne by the institute and the state government. "

Lucknow,Ayodhya’s World War II airport upgrade may hit air pocket,"LUCKNOW: The state government’s ambitious plan to build a world class airport at Ayodhya and recreate a mythological ambience buttressed with modern infrastructure to surpass Vatican and Mecca in footfalls, may just hit an air pocket, going by the ground reality. The government has asked Airports Authority of India (AAI) to upgrade the World War II airport in Ayodhya, which is lying almost defunct, barring limited landings by state choppers and small aircraft. Currently, touchdown on the tarmac is restricted to one flank because of a towering flyover in close proximity on Ayodhya-Sultanpur Road, which hinders flying operations. Also, the no-fly zone over the Ram Janmabhoomi site, just 8km from the airport, will remain a big challenge. Both the Centre and state government want to fast-track logistics, including setting up five-star hotels and shopping malls and the Rs 650-crore phased modernization plan of Ayodhya airport is top priority to cater to swelling pilgrims after the Ram temple is built. However, aviation experts and senior pilots in the aviation department expressed concern over the feasibility of a modernization blueprint and apprised seniors about their worries. Senior aviation officials, particularly those with flying experience of thousands of hours, point out that touchdown is confined to the East-West direction. The western side is blocked by a flyover, making it impossible to turn the current airstrip into a bustling world class airport. “When small aircraft are instructed not to fly from West-East direction, a big aircraft cannot,” said a senior officer in the technical section of civil aviation department. “The second major hurdle is the population density around the airport. During World War-II, the town was small and the airport was way beyond municipal limits. Now, the airport is almost in the heart of Ayodhya. Any upgradation would require land acquisition and the airport would have to intrude into residential areas, which is avoidable in civil aviation norms,” said technical officer. Equally important will be location of proposed Ram temple, which will be under constant security threat if big aircraft fly over Ram Janmabhoomi site, which is currently a no-fly zone. Aviation experts advocate that a new airport be set up across Saryu, which not only has adequate space for a full-fledged airport, but is away from janmabhoomi site and dense human habitation. This would lift restrictions on landings from one side. Principal secretary, civil aviation, Shashi Prakash Goel said, “Nobody raised these concerns with us. AAI is already working on the airport expansion plan.” "

Lucknow,My love affair with Lakhnawi food is for life: Chef Ranveer Brar,"Chef Ranveer Brar is excited to be seen as a judge in a cooking reality show set to begin this weekend. Brar, a celebrity chef, food stylist, and a reality show judge says that this season the show will be tougher than the previous ones. Brar, who shot to fame in India after he appeared on Masterchef India in 2015 for the first time, says the show has added to the popularity of fusion-food and experimental cuisine in the country. Accompanied by chefs Vikas Khanna and Vineet Bhatia, Brar, who belongs to Lucknow, says that the show, along with its Australian and American counterparts, has also made people want to cook more too. ""What’s also different is that unlike the show’s last season in 2016, which had only vegetarian cuisine, this time the contestants will be cooking and serving non-vegetarian dishes also,"" says Ranveer. ""Masterchef is back after a two-year gap so I’m sure a lot of people would be looking forward to it."" Talking about the recent trend of reality shows laying more emphasis on the contestant’s personal life, Brar says that this show will be different. ""Our show is not meant to change people’s lives, but it’s definitely meant to try and make their lives better. See, for every reality show, the aim is to show where the contestant has come from and how far he or she has reached in life. That’s why there is talk of their humble beginnings and background, only to show their perseverance and their will to make their life better and to reach the top. The same is the idea of our show. So it’s not actually a sob-sob story as some would call it, but the journey of an artist, and I call the person an artist because cooking for me is an art."" Ask him if he will be a tough and no-nonsense judge like Gordon Ramsay and Ranveer says, ""No. I believe in mentoring a contestant.

Brar, a celebrity chef, food stylist, and a reality show judge says that this season the show will be tougher than the previous ones. Brar, who shot to fame in India after he appeared on Masterchef India in 2015 for the first time, says the show has added to the popularity of fusion-food and experimental cuisine in the country. Accompanied by chefs Vikas Khanna and Vineet Bhatia, Brar, who belongs to Lucknow, says that the show, along with its Australian and American counterparts, has also made people want to cook more too. “What’s also different is that unlike the show’s last season in 2016, which had only vegetarian cuisine, this time the contestants will be cooking and serving non-vegetarian dishes also,” says Ranveer. “Masterchef is back after a two-year gap so I’m sure a lot of people would be looking forward to it."" Talking about the recent trend of reality shows laying more emphasis on the contestant’s personal life, Brar says that this show will be different. “Our show is not meant to change people’s lives, but it’s definitely meant to try and make their lives better. See, for every reality show, the aim is to show where the contestant has come from and how far he or she has reached in life. That’s why there is talk of their humble beginnings and background, only to show their perseverance and their will to make their life better and to reach the top. The same is the idea of our show. So it’s not actually a sob-sob story as some would call it, but the journey of an artist, and I call the person an artist because cooking for me is an art."" Ask him if he will be a tough and no-nonsense judge like Gordon Ramsay and Ranveer says,""No. I believe in mentoring a contestant.

Lucknow,They raped me and made a video recording: Unnao victim,"LUCKNOW: The woman who was allegedly attacked and burnt in Unnao on Thursday morning had claimed in her complaint to the police a year ago that the two accused made a video while raping her and threatened to make it viral on social media. These details are part of the investigation by Unnao police about the alleged gang-rape on December 12, 2018. She also alleged that the main accused, Shivam Trivedi, raped her multiple times. According to the survivor’s complaint in 2018, she was gang-raped at gunpoint by Shivam Trivedi and Shubham Trivedi. The two men took her to a temple at Hindu Nagar in Unnao with a promise that Shivam would marry her, she said in her statement. But she was raped. The girl told the police that after the crime, she took shelter at her aunt’s place in Rae Bareli. But the two came to know about the place and threatened to upload the rape video if she didn't ‘surrender’ before them. When she went to meet Shivam, he allegedly locked her up and kept an eye on her movements. ""He would take me to different towns and rape me on the pretext that he would marry me someday,"" the girl said. She also alleged that the accused prepared an affidavit for marriage in a civil court, but he brought the girl from Rae Bareli and dropped her at her Unnao residence. “Time and again, he would keep threatening to make videos public and eliminate my family members,” her statement said.

Kanpur,"Unnao case: Thrashed, stabbed, set ablaze, rape survivor runs for help in a ball of fire","UNNAO: In a rerun of the Hyderabad horror, a 23-year-old gang-rape survivor was stabbed multiple times, doused in petrol and set ablaze by five men, including two of her alleged rapists, in her village in Unnao district early Thursday morning while she was on her way to meet her lawyer. The girl, who was thrashed with sticks before she was stabbed brutally, ran through the morning mist in a ball of fire, screaming for help before an eyewitness called up the police. She suffered 90% burns and was shuttled from a primary health centre to Unnao district hospital and then to a government hospital in Kanpur, before being rushed to Civil Hospital, Lucknow. Later, she was airlifted to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. The horrific crime comes a week after two truck drivers and their helpers gang-raped a veterinary doctor on the outskirts of Hyderabad and killed her before setting her body on fire. Unnao had hit national headlines earlier this year when another gang-rape survivor from the district met with an accident near Rae Bareli when she was travelling with her lawyer and aunts.

Among the attackers were the fathers of the two men. The survivor, who is from a backward caste, was on her way to take a train to Rae Bareli to meet her lawyers when she was intercepted by the five accused at 4.15am. The girl was just 300 metres from the railway station when she was brutally attacked. One of the rapists who attacked her, Shivam Trivedi, was released on bail in the rape case just five days ago. Shivam and his neighbour Shubham had allegedly gangraped the girl on December 12 last year, but police filed an FIR after nearly four months despite the survivor approaching them a day after the crime. Hours after the horror unfolded on Thursday, all the five accused were arrested from their homes. The woman identified her assailants as Shivam, his father Harishankar, Shubham, his father Kishore Trivedi and their accomplice Umesh Bajpai. A case against them has been lodged at a police station in Rae Bareli. A guard working with a gas agency who saw the girl engulfed in flames told TOI: “Despite the fire, she was conscious and identified herself.

He even signed some agreement to marry her but later refused, after which the girl lodged a case of rape against him,” Bhagat told newspersons. Bhagat’s boss, UP DGP O P Singh, said it was a “systemic failure” of criminal justice system when reporters pointed out to him that Shivam was released on bail in the rape case just five days before Thursday’s crime. “It is systemic failure of criminal justice system. One of the four compartments of criminal justice system, including prisons, prosecution and judiciary, is definitely at fault. But it’s not fair on my part to put blame on any one part of the system. But the fact that the accused was ar rested then given bail cannot be ignored,” said Singh. Singh said police “must have” opposed the bail plea of the accused and termed the incident very unfortunate. “Our priority now is to save the life of the girl.

Lucknow,UP Police booked most traffic violators in Noida &amp; Varanasi,"LUCKNOW: Even as higher penalties were implemented for traffic violations from September, the whip cracked by UP Police this year found the maximum number of violations in the state’s two busiest cities—Varanasi and Noida. Between January 19 and December 2 this year, more than 8.1 lakh violators were fined in Varanasi, ahead of 7.1 lakh in Noida. Among all cities, though, Noida reported the highest amount in penalties with Rs 11 crore for the period. While Varanasi generated a revenue of Rs 3.1 crore, Ghaziabad and Lucknow fared better with a collection of Rs 6.2 crore and Rs 4.5 crore, respectively. Bareilly with Rs 4.1 crore and Agra with revenue of Rs 2.1 crore followed. Overall, UP Police made a collection of Rs 50 crore in the period from fines for traffic violations. However, e-challans which were sent to many violators could not yield immediate collection. Nearly Rs 188 crore is pending with them. Even then, the collection has been the highest in the past decade when it wavered between Rs 20 crore and Rs 35 crore every year. The city with the lowest number of challans issued was Sitapur, where only 10 people were fined. Fatehgarh (43), Kaushambi (100), Banda (342), Mahoba (377) and Hardoi (462) were among the bottom 10. In Gorakhpur, around 69,000 people were penalised for such violations, generating Rs 1.5 crore in revenue. The reason behind the surge in collection was attributed to both hand-held devices with police personnel as well as their increased numbers. "

Lucknow,Babri Masjid razing case verdict by April?,"LUCKNOW: The special CBI court in Lucknow is likely to pronounce a verdict in the 27-year-old Babri Masjid demolition case by April 2020. It was on December 6, 1992 that the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished allegedly by hundreds of kar sevaks. The prosecution, CBI, is expected to complete presentation of witnesses by December, as directed by the Supreme Court. The criminal trial involves several senior BJP leaders. Former deputy PM LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, former UP CM Kalyan Singh, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiar, Sadhvi Ritambhara, Ram Vilas Vedanti and 25 others are accused in the case. As of now, the CBI is presenting evidence against Kalyan Singh, who was UP CM when the mosque was demolished. The court had framed charges against 48 people in all. Of these, 16 accused, including Bal Thackarey and Ashok Singhal, have died. The case was lodged in Ramjanmabhoomi police station of Ayodhya 27 years ago. It was later shifted to the CBI court in Lucknow. Trial began only in 2005. While 1,026 witnesses were listed in the case, till date, only 348 have recorded their statements. Senior advocate MM Haq, who is assisting the prosecution (CBI), said, “Among those who have recorded their statements are Haji Mahboob, IPS officer Anju Gupta and journalists Mark Tully, Sheetla Singh and Suman Gupta.” “The judgement is expected by March as special CBI judge hearing the case Surendra Kumar Yadav has got an extension from the Supreme Court till March 31 after his retirement on September 30,” added Haq. “Kalyan Singh was exempted from trial because he was the governor of a state but he was summoned in September after his tenure ended,” said Haq. In April 2017, the Supreme Court had directed the court to complete the trial within two years. However, the judge had sought more time, citing the voluminous number of witnesses. In July 2019, the SC directed the special court to finish the trial within nine months. After CBI presents witnesses, the court will sum up the evidence and inform the accused. Thereafter, the accused can produce their witnesses and evidence. After that is cross-checked, the court would hear oral arguments of the parties and deliver its judgment. "
Lucknow,Congress placed hurdles in way of Ram temple: Yogi Adityanath,"LUCKNOW: A day ahead of the 27th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday slammed the Congress for putting road blocks in the path of the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and for speaking in a language that suited Pakistan. Addressing a rally in Itchagarh assembly seat in poll-bound Jharkhand, Yogi said that if the Congress had not created barriers, the long-standing issue of Ramjanmabhoomi would have been solved years ago. “Jo Ram ka nahi, wo kisi kaam ka nahi (One who is not loyal to Lord Ram is of no use),” Yogi said, amid loud chants of Jai Shri Ram from BJP supporters. Yogi reiterated that it was the strength of democracy and judiciary which ensured that no untoward incident happened after the Supreme Court’s verdict favouring construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Yogi also accused the Congress and other opposition parties of ordering firing on kar sevaks who had turned up in large numbers for Ayodhya from Bihar and Jharkhand. Yogi said the Ram temple movement was close to the heart of the people from the SC/ST community who had come to Ayodhya for kar seva in the early 1990s. “The current generation has not witnessed or participated in any Ram temple movement. The previous generations have borne lot of pains for the issue,” he said. The CM said that the BJP had promised a Ram temple before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “Now, we are on the verge of delivering it,” Yogi said. "

Lucknow,"At Rs 120 a kg, onion a tear-jerker in Lucknow","By: Akshata Mishra LUCKNOW: The price of onion peaked to Rs 120 a kilo in the city on Thursday, prompting the gravy and salad staple to do a vanishing act in many households while stretching the kitchen budget in others. The bad news is that the edible bulb may become dearer at Rs 140-150 per kg before the rate plummets with the arrival of fresh supply around mid-December. Even a week ago, the onion was priced below Rs 100 a kilo. The spike was witnessed around Sunday-Monday, especially at markets in Bhootnath, Indiranagar and Narhi. “The last time the onion acted so pricey was in August-September 2015, when crops were damaged in the rain,” recalled Raju, a wholesaler at Naveen Galla Mandi on Sitapur Road. According to wholesalers, a gradual price rise had been witnessed around August-September this year too owing to poor supply following monsoon crop damage in Maharashtra and Karnataka. October saw a dip in rate, but it soared again in November-December because of the wedding season. Homemaker Sheela Chauhan observed that the onion had become more expensive than paneer, the Asian soft cheese considered high-end in vegetarian meals. To buffer the budget blow, I buy only small onions. Earlier, any gravy would have three-four onions at our home. Nowadays, it is just half an onion,” she said. Many restaurants in the city have been forced to change their menus or increase prices to keep the profit margin same. The footfall is not as good as it used to be, rued some eatery owners. Amit Srivastava, a caterer, voiced his dilemma. “At weddings, you cannot completely do away with onions. Hence, the per plate cost has increased by a margin of Rs 50 to Rs 150, depending on the number of items on the menu that require onions. Customers are not happy,” he said. Onion hoarders to face music, warns DM Lucknow: Following complaints of hoarding, the district administration has warned of strict action against those who try to cash in on the current onion crisis. “Teams will conduct surprise inspections and hoarders will be penalised,” said DM Abhishek Prakash after a review meeting on the price hike on Thursday. Officials have been asked to coordinate with Nashik mandis in Maharashtra for more supply to Lucknow. The district supply officer has been directed to prepare a plan to open 50 centres in the 110 wards (one for every two wards) of Lucknow Municipal Corporation. Also, onions will be made available to state government employees at reasonable rates through government canteens, the authorities said. "
Lucknow,BSP: Will expose harassment of Dalits by all governments,"LUCKNOW: To counter BJP’s Dalit outreach, BSP will use the occasion of BR Ambedkar’s death anniversary on December 6 to apprise Dalits and backwards about their “systematic harassment” by various governments and political parties. Programmes will be organised across the country, with special focus on UP, where party chief Mayawati has appealed for massive participation. In a meeting with party workers recently, she said: “Along with enumerating the life struggles of BR Ambedkar, also speak about the importance of what he did to empower Dalits. In the current political situation, all kinds of conspiracies are being hatched to deprive Dalits, backwards and minorities of their basic rights.” This, say senior party members, is an attempt by the BSP to counter BJP’s narrative which has been carrying out Dalit/ST outreach programmes for the past several months. “BJP has never ever cared about Dalits or backwards and are now playing caste politics to make inroads into this segment. It started about two years back when they made it compulsory to have Ambedkar’s photograph in all government offices. The rule is being flouted across the board, including government offices in Lucknow, but then Dalits and Ambedkar have never been a priority for BJP,” said a BSP leader. “Crores of Ambedkar’s followers in the country are being subjected to injustice, torture and exploitation while their fundamental rights are being trampled upon but BJP is making Ambedkar’s name an issue,” she had said.

Lucknow,UP:Mayawati aide &amp; custodian of Dalit memorials joins BJP,"LUCKNOW: Tribhuwan Ram, a close aide of BSP chief Mayawati and former MLA from Varanasi, joined BJP on Thursday. The technocrat-turned-politician was head of PWD during Mayawati regime when Dalit memorials and parks were built in Lucknow and Noida. Ram joined BJP along with former BSP minister Vinod Singh, who was expelled from the party in 2018 on charges of indiscipline and anti-party activities. The two leaders joined the saffron party in the presence of UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. Ram told TOI that he does not have any personal grudges against Mayawati but her party is fast losing its relevance because of its casteist approach. “Dalit icon BR Ambedkar and BSP founder Kanshi Ram used to say that a party can help the poor and downtrodden only when it is in power. In case of BSP it is nowhere,” he said. Ram added he joined the BJP after being impressed with pro-poor policies of Modi government at the Centre and Yogi government in the state. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said the leaders will strengthen the party and take it forward. “We hope that they would continue to work for the poor and downtrodden,” he said. During his stint as head of public works department, Ram was twice given extension by the Mayawati government. When BSP government was voted out in 2012, then state Lokayukta NK Mehrotra had indicted the BSP regime of swindling nearly Rs 1,400 crore in construction of memorials. PWD is the nodal department of Rajkiya Nirman Nigam which built most of the Dalit memorials in Lucknow and Noida. Ram was elected MLA from Asgara seat in Varanasi in 2012 elections. But he lost the seat to SBSP candidate Kailash Nath Sonkar in 2017 elections. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati fielded him from Macchlishahr but he lost to BP Saroj of BJP by a slender margin of 116 votes. "

In the first measure, the irrigation department has started releasing more water from Narora dam so that increased water level engulfs the major part of the river banks. In another measure, teams of officials have started visiting localities situated on the bank of the river to review cleanliness and other civic issues. Modi is likely to visit the city on December 14 to review the Namami Gange Mission. During his Kanpur stay, he will visit the ghats from Ganga Barrage to Siddhanath Ghat. During ghat inspection, he could also witness the Sisamau Nullah, notorious in terms of discharging sewage waste into the Ganga. Teams of Kanpur Municipal Corporation officials have conducted a survey of Rani Ghat, Magzine Ghat, Aspatral Ghat, Guptar Ghat and localities situated there. Construction of public lavatories has started, pits are being dug for septic tanks and pipes and drains of houses have been disconnected so that effluent could not pass into the river. Meanwhile, officials of Narora dam have increased the water quantity being released into the river. According to the officials in Kanpur, around 8 cusecs water has been released from Narora on Thursday and the exercise would continue in the next few days so that the river appears full of water. Jal Nigam, which is playing a role in treating water pollution, is taking no chance. Managing director of Jal Nigam, Vikas Gotharwal, inspected the Ganga Barrage and treatment plant there and directed the employees and officials to keep a vigil at the plant and other points. Amid unconfirmed reports of chief minister’s Yogi Adityanath possible visit, mayor Pramlia Pandey visited Rani Ghat and Budhia Ghat. Under Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC) campaign, dairies were removed from the city and stray animals were caught. KMC has conducted survey of localities situated on the river banks through non-government organizations (NGOs). The survey was conducted at Rani Ghat, Magzine Ghat, Sarsaiya Ghat, Parmat Ghat and some other ghats and reported that around 3,500 houses were involved in discharging sewer and other effluent into the river. To check this, around 500 lavatories would be required. The municipal corporation would raise lavatories on the basis of this report and efforts are being made to get start the job before the prime minister’s visit. "

Lucknow,How Lucknow police allowed couple who abandoned newborn girl to escape,"LUCKNOW: A newborn girl was found covered in maggots in a bush in Mohanlalganj on July 14. Three days later, her parents were electronically traced to Chandigarh, but the city’s laggard cops took 75 days to make an abortive attempt to physically track them down. While lung infection snuffed out the baby’s life on October 28, the couple who abandoned her is still ‘missing’ despite an FIR being lodged on July 15. Member of child welfare committee Sangeeta Sharma said police inaction gave the baby’s parents an opportunity to escape. “When police knew their location, they should not have waited so long. We have decided to write to the SSP, seeking action against cops guilty of negligence,” she said. After she was found along a Mohanlalganj road, the newborn girl had been rushed to a government hospital. She had later been shifted to a private hospital in Dalibagh, where she underwent treatment for 27 days. She was sent to a shelter on Prag Narain Road on August 10. On July 17, based on phone surveillance, police came to know that her parents were living in Chandigarh. But when a team reached the location on October 2, the couple had vanished from their residence and their phones were switched off. To cover up their embarrassment, police said they would trace the duo with the help of a relative in Unnao. That never happened. On October 26, the baby was admitted to KGMU with respiratory distress and diagnosed with infected lungs. She died two days later. Dr Mirza Waqar Beg, who treated her after she was found in a bush, said when she was brought to hospital, her blood was infected. “She had over 36 maggots crawling all over her body. Fortunately, she had responded to treatment back then,” he added. Mohanlalganj additional inspector Rafi Alam, who is also investigating officer in the case, said they first traced the hospital where the girl was born and based on that information, found a relative in Unnao. “We got the number of the baby’s father, a brick kiln worker, from this relative. The man had an extramarital affair with his sister-in-law who is the mother of the baby. Fearing stigma, they abandoned the baby. An FIR was lodged against the parents,” Alam said. “It takes time to establish coordination with the police outside UP, and then in such blind cases it is not easy but admitted that more sensitivity should have been shown by the investigation officer,” said RK Shukla, CO, Mohanlalganj.

Lucknow,How swine flu virus has free run at OPDs in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: While the H1N1 virus is stalking the state capital with a seasonal incidence rate of more than three patients a day, swine flu prevention protocol is conspicuous by its absence at two super speciality hospitals in the city. A TOI reality check has revealed that Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) largely ignore guidelines set by the World Health Organisation despite Lucknow witnessing 550 cases in less than six months (January-March, October-December) and seven deaths till date. TimesViewPrevention is better than cure. SGPGI and Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences are top institutes of UP and must lead by example by following the preventive parametres prescribed by WHO. In fact, SGPGI gets suspected swine flu cases from across UP for confirmatory test. The flow of confirmed HINI influenza patients coming to SGPGI for treatment is also highest in comparison to other hospitals and medical institutes in the stat e. Precautionary measures would not only prevent spread of this highly contagious disease, but also reduce the burden of treatment. Similarly, RMLIMS can contribute in prevention and save valuable lives.An earlier survey had exposed similar healthcare anomalies at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Balrampur Hospital and SPM Civil Hospital. SGPGIMSThe state health department recognises as valid swine flu tests done only at two government hospitals and SGPGI is one of them. While KGMU is the other recognised institution, the maximum number of cases so far this year have been treated in SGPGI. Despite this significant place in healthcare hierarchy, the hospital OPD has no separate registration counter or isolated waiting lounge for suspected patients of swine flu, an air-borne viral disease that spreads through coughing, sneezing, shaking hands or touching contaminated surfaces. Awareness posters to promote wearing of masks, among other things, are missing as are signs to guide patients to diagnostic labs. At the old OPD building, a grimy poster with the message that swine flu test is conducted ‘here’ was found outside a room, but enquiry revealed that the facility had been shifted elsewhere. The only face-saver for SGPGI is an 11-bed exclusive ward for swine flu patients. “After registration, patients with flu-like symptoms are first sent to the pulmonary OPD and then to the lab. Those who test positive are admitted to the isolation ward. Since the report takes 48 hours, a suspected patient can infect many others during that gap in the absence of safety protocol,” said an OPD visitor. RML hospitalLike SGPGI, this hospital too disregards WHO recommendations to stall a swine flu outbreak. RML hospital may have a six-bed isolation ward, but the OPD is a virus cauldron where suspected patients freely mix with others. RMLIMS director AK Tripathi, who is also officiating director of SGPGI at present, promised to plug the loopholes ASAP. “I will direct chief medical superintendent of both institutes to follow standard guidelines of WHO without delay,” he said.

Lucknow,"Exhausted, orchestra dancer pauses to take a break, gets shot in the face","AGRA: Six days after a 27-year-old dancer was shot at when she paused to take a break after performing on stage for a while at a village wedding in Uttar Pradesh’s Chitrakoot district, police arrested a local gram pradhan and his relative on Friday. A video clip of the incident has been widely circulated since. Sudhir Singh, a 45-year-old gram pradhan of Tikra village and his 50-year-old relative, Phool Singh, have been arrested and charged under Sections 212 (harbouring offender) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC and under the Illegal Arms Act. According to local police, on November 30, Sudhir Singh had hired an orchestra for his daughter’s wedding, where a group of women were performing onstage. The injured woman has been identified as Heena Devi, who was taken to Lucknow SGPGI for a jaw surgery. She is said to be in stable condition now. Station house officer (SHO) Subhash Chaurasia of Mau police said, “After dancing non-stop, the woman was feeling exhausted and took a brief pause, when Phool Singh started firing. Stray pellets then struck Heena Devi and two other men, Mithlesh and Kamlesh.” The 34-second video purportedly shot from a mobile phone shows that the woman was struck in her jaw when she stopped dancing. In the video, an unidentified man is being heard saying, “...Goli chal jaayegi agar yeh gana lag jaaye… kaho toh ek fire ho… Sudhir bhai maro ek [If this song is played, bullet will be fired. Are you up for a gunshot? Sudhir, open fire].” “As soon as the unidentified man calls Sudhir to fire a shot, a bullet struck Heena’s jaw, while Mithlesh and Kamlesh — two siblings who were also the groom’s relatives — sustained injuries in their wrist and leg,” the SHO added. Sources said after the incident, police reportedly helped the gram pradhan wind up the function. They, however, did not arrest him. The pradhan also allegedly helped Phool Singh flee. “The two accused were on the run. A country-made pistol was used by Phool Singh to fire shots,” the SHO further said. "
Kanpur,CBI books sitting HC judge in UP medical college scam,"LUCKNOW: The CBI has registered a case against seven persons, including a sitting Allahabad HC judge, for allegedly taking a bribe to pass a favourable order to allow Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) to admit students. PIMS, on the Lucknow-Kanpur Road, was one of the 46 colleges barred from admitting students due to substandard infrastructure and not conforming to teaching criteria in 2017. The FIR (registered on December 4) against Allahabad HC judge SN Shukla comes four months after the then chief justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, gave the CBI sanction to book a serving HC judge. Along with Justice Shukla, the agency filed a case against a retired Chhattisgarh high court judge for corruption and criminal conspiracy. Justice Shukla’s prosecution is the first such case since the 1991 Supreme Court judgment allowing probes against judges. Justice Shukla is accused of favouring PIMS by extending the deadline for admission of students, a contravention of existing rules. The CBI said it conducted multiple searches at the premises of all seven accused, including Justice Shukla, in Lucknow, Meerut and Delhi and recovered several “incriminating documents”. The searches were carried out at the premises of Justice S N Shukla in Vridavan Yojna and I M Quddusi’s residence in Lawrence Terrace. Similar searches were carried out at the premises of PIMS member B P Yadav and his son, Palash Yadav, at Eldeco Greens, and at the residence of co-accused Subhash Giri in Meerut. The searches, officials said, would continue in coming days. The FIR has alleged that Yadav and his son, who have been managing the PIMS trust, held several meetings with conspirators. The agency had earlier arrested former Chhattisgarh HC judge I M Quddusi a day after it had registered the first FIR in September 2017. The trial is likely to begin in January 2020. CBI sleuths have alleged that Justice Quddusi, along with a private person, had met Justice Shukla on August 25, 2017 at his residence in Lucknow and “delivered illegal gratification”. “After the SC differed with the HC (on the case), B P Yadav pursued I M Quddusi to get back the illegal gratification paid to Justice Shukla. Quddusi contacted Justice Shukla for the return of the illegal gratification and a part of it was returned,” the FIR said. The FIR also said a conspiracy was allegedly hatched among the accused to withdraw a writ petition before the SC. "

Kanpur,Activists hail killing of Hyderabad rape accused,"KANPUR: Social activists, women organizations and lawyers’ association of the city have hailed killing of the four accused in police encounter in Hyderabad. The residents, who strongly condemned the rape and killing of the veterinary doctor in Hyderabad, had demanded severe punishment, including the lynching of the accused. On Friday morning, as soon as the news of the encounter of four rape and murder accused flashed on social media, most of the residents welcomed the police action. Kanpur Bar Association (KBA) also expressed happiness over the encounter of the four accused. KBA general secretary Kapil Deep Sachan said that though it was an extrajudicial act, it was the need of the time. “Slow administration of justice has disappointed the people, and Nirbhaya’s case is before us... none of the accused have been hanged so far”, he said. Anoop Dwivedi, advocate, and representative of ‘Parivartan’, a social organization, said that the encounter would give a strong message to culprits. “Speedy trials should be held in rape cases. Recently, some courts have observed in their judgments that trial in rape cases must be completed within twenty days”, he said. Women organizations too have expressed happiness over the encounter. “Society needs such a strong message. Courts take years to sentence a rape accused. The encounter is justified”, said a social activist. The deterrent act of the Hyderabad police would definitely instill fear among those who physically exploit women, she added. Some members of the women organizations even distributed sweets, “Speedy justice has been done”, said Omar Vaishya of Jagdish Mahila Mandal. Police have delivered justice to the deceased doctor. Deterrent laws should be enacted to deal with crime against women, she demanded.

Lucknow,"Lucknow not just a khayal, it’s soul of every native","Vijay Chopra Lucknow: Ever thought what is Lucknow? It’s not just a city, nor an idea. Lucknow is, instead, a soul that resides in every native, and even in those who do not have Awadhi roots. This was one of the narratives at a free-flowing discussion in the session titled ‘Lucknow Ek Khayal’ on the inaugural day of Metaphor literary festival. The three panellists — filmmaker Muzaffar Ali, theatre actor-director Salim Arif, and Bollywood dialogue-script writer Javed Siddiqui — elaborated on the theme by sharing their experiences and anecdotes drawn from Lucknow. The session was moderated by veteran actor-writer Atul Tewari, himself a Lucknowite. Muzaffar Ali began by saying that Lucknow is a constant concern for him. While the city’s complexities, problems, changing culture are a bother, on a positive side, these very issues are behind my long indulgence with the city, he said. Every individual sees Lucknow through a different prism, which is moulded by their upbringing and the phase witnessed while growing up, he added. Siddiqui, though an outsider (he hails from Rampur), shares a close connect with Awadhi land. “You cannot take Lucknow out of anything; be it food, art, language, clothes, or dance. Lucknow and tehzeeb are intertwined,” said Siddiqui, who penned the dialogues of Satyajit Ray’s celluloid wonder Shatranj ke khiladi. While singing paeans to Awadh’s rich heritage, the panellists lamented its erosion in the present times. The salutation ‘adaab’ would always evoke “jeete raho” reply from the elderly. That’s the kind of Lucknow I miss now, said Siddiqui. Salim Arif regaled the audience with tales of Lucknow University days when the campus was a “wildlife sanctuary for boys”, meaning they could not indulge in any mischief beyond the campus. Arif said Lucknow’s uniqueness was in accepting anything from outside. But slowly yet prominently, there has been erosion of the humanist culture and that reflects poorly on its natives, Arif said. The panellists exhorted the city’s youth to respect and preserve the rare and vast legacy inherited by them. “A city retains and spreads its heritage through people. That’s something not done by the governments,” said Siddqiui. Atul Tewari gave a metaphorical conclusion to the session by saying, “Lucknow ka raag wahi hai, bas chaal aur taal tez ho gaye hain (city’s ethos is still the same though its tenor and pace have accelerated).” "

Lucknow,I just love coming to Lucknow: TV actor Ankit Bathla,"Television actor Ankit Bathla, of 'Thapki Pyaar Ki' fame, has been frequenting the city for a while. On his recent visit to Lucknow, he said, ""I love coming to Lucknow. What I really like about the city is of course the food which I’m sure brings a lot of other people here too. The first thing I did after coming to Lucknow was go to Tundey kebabs, because that’s one thing you just cannot miss. Then someone told me to try out Dastarkhwan this time and so I did. I absolutely loved their chicken delicacies along with naan and roti. So Lucknow is one place for me now where I can binge because whatever I can’t do in Mumbai, like have fried chicken and stuff, I can do here. But honestly, Lucknow as a city has really become so beautiful. There are so many new places that have come up. The city has become way cleaner than what I have seen in the past. Lucknow Times was really kind to take me to this really nice place called Sharma Tea Stall. I didn’t know about it, so I was really kicked to see the samosas and hot chai boiling in the morning so that’s kind of how I started my day today."" Ankit visited Sharma Chai at Lalbagh and feasted on the chai and samosa there. (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Ankit visited Sharma Chai at Lalbagh and feasted on the chai and samosa there. (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) The actor has become quite popular in Indonesia with shows like 'Cinta Di Pangkuan Himalaya' and the dubbed version of 'Thapki Pyaar Ki' in Bahasa language, on air in the country. When asked about his experience of working in Indonesian shows and if the audience there has welcomed him with open arms, Ankit said, ""Indonesia is almost like my second home now. The people there have given me so much love that it’s heartwarming to see so many people adore and love you. I was blessed to be there for about six months and learn their language. You’ll be amazed to know that most of their words are derived from Sanskrit and Hindi. What really takes me back to Indonesia actually are the fans whose support and love is beyond imagination for me."" The actor further added, ""I actually went to Indonesia during Thapki... because that show was really popular there. And I eventually did shows for them, we did reality shows and stuff. I’m looking forward to going back to Indonesia again because it’s a country that I really love.” Ankit Bathla (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Ankit Bathla (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Revealing how the Indonesian audience reacts to Indian shows, the actor said, ""Indonesians love Indian shows more than they actually love their own shows. You’ll be surprised to know that the top Indian shows are still running in Indonesia. It’s amazing! Films in fact, is a smaller market compared to the television in Indonesia. So we are kind of really-really famous, more than the film stars. So it’s a different world altogether. The sweetest part is that they first watch our shows in Hindi and then in Bahasa, their language, so it’s like double love and applaud from them."" Talking about the difference in working styles in the television industry of both countries, Ankit says, ""In India, we make about 22 minutes of an episode which takes a day to shoot and in Indonesia, they make 4 hours of content in a day. So 1 episode is 4 hours of content. They shoot day and night and telecast from Monday to Sunday, so basically all days of a week. The TRP is measured every day, so if the show doesn’t get good TRP in Indonesia, they can shut the show the very next day. It’s a very competitive industry.""

When asked about the same, Ankit replied, ""I am literally asked this question in almost all the interviews. Nibedita and I are just friends. I am single, although I obviously do want a life partner and I’m looking for one, but I’m single right now. Nibedita and I did meet of course, but we decided that we’re better off as just friends. We are not a couple."" Ankit also shares a beautiful bond with co-star and Lucknowite Jaya Bhattacharya. ""I have been calling Jaya ji mumma since my show Thapki... In fact, my real mom and Jaya maám fight with each other. When my mom comes to Mumbai, Jaya maám would say ‘Tu kyun aayi hai? He’s my son in Bombay. So if you want to spend time with him take him to Delhi. He’s my son here, so this is my time’. Jaya mumma is one of the purest souls I have come across and I love her. Since I know this is her hometown, I love Lucknow even more."" — Yashi Agarwal "

I have many memories associated with this place, so I wanted to spend some time here. Though the place of the basketball court, where I used to play earlier has changed. But when I saw students playing there I couldn’t resist myself joining in and playing a game with them. I really had a great time playing here."" He adds, ""I feel everyone should have a habit of going to a ground daily and playing a game.

Mere liye gaon jaane jaisa tha but the character had much more to offer. I had to keep myself a step behind the two ladies (shooter dadis) which was fine with me because the character demanded it. But even in personal life, I believe that a girl should not be stopped from doing what she wants do just because she is a girl. And the reason for such thoughts is that I have two sisters for whom I sat at the ground for years so that they can play.

""Though I explored the city while I was shooting for Daas Dev in 2014, but this time because it’s a three-week schedule, I am exploring the city more. Lucknow has so much to offer, from kebabs to kulfi, from kachoris to chaat, culture, history. Lucknow has everything when it comes to food, culture, history and art.

Kanpur,Isro space tech cells at IITs to promote student research,"NEW DELHI: To promote research in space technologies, Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has set up five space technology cells at premier institutions. The cells have been set up at IITs — Bombay, Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras, IISc, Bengaluru, and joint research programme with Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune. The information about the space cells was provided to the Rajya Sabha by MoS for department of space Jitendra Singh recently. Talking to TOI, Isro chairman K Sivan said, “We are setting up different kinds of hubs to promote space research. The cells are in addition to incubation centres and research centres being set up across the country to promote research by youths and students.” On the upcoming PSLV-C48 launch on December 11, Sivan told TOI that “one of the nine customer satellites to be launched along with primary payload Risat-2BR1 (surveillance satellite) has been made by Israeli students”. Jointly built by Herzliya Science Center and Sha’ar Hanegev High School students in Israel, experimental satellite Duchifat-3, weighing just 2.3 kg, is designed to help Israeli students observe the Earth from space. The educational satellite, which has an on-board camera for earth imaging and an amateur radio transponder, will mainly be used for ecological research like checking air and water source pollution and forest monitoring. Three Israeli students — Alon Abramovich, Meitav Assulin and Shmuel Aviv Levi, all 17 to 18 years old— are arriving in the country on Monday to witness the launch of Duchifat-3 by PSLV C48 rocket from Sriharikota next Wednesday, says an agency report. For youths, Isro has already set up incubation centres on the campuses of NITs in Agartala, Jalandhar and Tiruchirappalli. The work on the rest (in Bhubaneswar, Nagpur and Indore) is going on, the Isro chief informed. On space research centres, Sivan said, “Places where academic excellence and industry are there, we will be establishing R&amp;D centres there so that people can make use of the industry to research and make their products.” These R&amp;D hubs will come up in Guwahati, Jaipur, Varanasi, Kurukshetra, Patna and Kanyakumari. “The centres will give a platform to talented youths across the country to come up with bright ideas and do research on those ideas for developing space technologies,” he said. Even schoolchildren are being enrolled in different Isro- and government-sponsored programmes like ‘Samwad with Students’, guided tours to Isro centres and PM innovative learning programme “Dhruv” to raise their interest in space technology.

Lucknow,"Caste bias plagues civil services, says former IAS","Lucknow: Seven decades of Independence and several laws on equality later, caste system is still omnipresent in the Indian society and the civil services is not untouched by it, Raghav Chandra said. The former IAS officer-turned-author was speaking to TOI on Saturday on the sidelines of Metaphor Literary Festival, where a book reading of his Kali’s Daughter was organised. The compelling novel chronicles the life of Deepika Thakur, a Dalit woman who is the first member of her family to crack the Indian Civil Services and the ordeal she goes through during her growing up years because of caste prejudices. “Casteism stills plagues our society and the civil services is just a micro-picture... When I was posted as secretary of National Commission for Scheduled Tribes, there were several complaints against non-tribal officers harassing their tribal colleagues... The bias was prevalent in other commissions,” Chandra said. The former IAS recalled how during his posting in key departments such as revenue and urban development, he came across hundreds and thousands of Dalits who were victims of caste bias. “When I was a collector at Khandwa and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, there were many instances of Dalit exploitation. All land issues are basically related to caste. One of the reasons our agriculture sector is so backward is casteism,” said Chandra, an alumnus of La Martiniere, Lucknow. Asked if reservation is a historical legacy or a blunder, he said: “The Supreme Court has excluded the creamy layer within the SC/ST community from quota benefits. The Centre has already asked the court to review this judgment.” “With economic progress, the perception may have changed but not thoroughly yet... The oppression is so historical that I feel India will take ages to do away with reservation. The income gap needs to be narrowed. Therefore, Dalits still need affirmative support. How many upper caste parents happily marry their kids to a Dalit in modern-day India? If a young couple goes against parents’ wish, they are likely to be tortured or even killed,” he added. Stating that the impenetrable social divide had for centuries crushed human lives, Chandra cited a Times of India report where a Dalit MP in Karnataka was denied entry to a village in his constituency in September this year. “A Lok Sabha member for BJP from Chitradurga, A Narayanaswamy was not allowed to enter a Yadava-dominated village in his constituency because he is a Dalit... Isn’t this insane?” "

Kanpur,Gang rape accused arrested after survivor hangs self,"Kanpur: Drawing flak from all quarters for their inaction which forced a 17-year-old gang rape survivor to hang herself on Friday night, Kanpur Dehat police arrested the third accused in the case on Sunday. After the survivor, who hailed from Kanpur Dehat, hanged herself at her cousin’s house in Kanpur City, the police had on Saturday arrested two of the accused, identified as Sunny and Lala. Additional SP, Kanpur Dehat, Anoop Kumar confirmed that the third accused, Rinku, has been nabbed and is being quizzed. He refused to share further information. After the girl ended her life, her family alleged that she took the extreme step due to police inaction. According to police, the girl and three men were residents of the same village in Kanpur Dehat. The girl’s family had alleged that the girl was abducted by Sunny, Lala and Rinku on November 13 and was recovered only on November 16. They had also alleged that the girl was gang-raped in captivity by the three men and that the cops did not lodge an FIR under section of rape and instead registered a case of kidnapping. The victim's family had also alleged that since November 16 when the FIR was lodged against the three men, police had not taken any action even though she narrated her ordeal before senior police officials. It was only on Saturday that the police could arrest Sunny and Lala. The victim’s family claimed while the FIR under sections of kidnapping was registered on November 16, the charge of gang rape was added to the original FIR only on December 2. No arrests were made in this duration. They also claimed that the three men were influential and had been threatening them. Since no action was taken against the accused, the gang rape survivor took the extreme step. The family said had the cops acted swiftly, she would have been alive. "

So my parents used to encourage me to participate in extra curricular activities and not just study. They didn't want me to quit studies but wanted me to be an all-rounder. However, little idea did they have at that time that I will not study and become an actor and a writer one day."" In order to get a break, Raghav reveals how he, along with a friend, wrote a serial, so that he could debut into acting. ""I wrote a television series with a friend of mine two years back in which I also acted. The show was Inmates. Then I got offers for movies like Mickey Virus with Manish Paul and also Purani Jeans. I have also written several short films and have also assisted various directors in different projects,” says Raghav, adding, “Finding work in Mumbai for an outsider like me is not at all easy. The demand and supply of actors in the industry is not balanced. The actors are more in quantity that the demand. So work wise, we have to do something hatt ke to get noticed and to get work, especially if we do not have contacts in Bollywood. So instead of doing titbit of work here and there, I want to do good work in Bollywood."" Being from Lucknow, however, give actors an edge over others in Bollywood, says Raghav. ""Being from Lucknow, people in Bollywood think that we are bound to be good with our tallafuz. But har achhi Hindi bolne waala achha actor ho yeh zaroori nahi hai. Even singers and lyricist and writers from Lucknow get a lot of preference in Bollywood. A lot of actors from Mumbai in fact, learn Hindi from Lucknowites.

A lot of people from here are making a living out of this – acting sikhana, dialect sikhana, shuddh hindi ke words sikhana this is what a lot of us do for actors in Mumbai,"" says this proud Lucknowite.

Kanpur,"Fire safety check: Thickly populated localities, narrow lanes vulnerable","Kanpur: Several densely populated localities of the city that have been turned into commercial areas are vulnerable to the fire incidents. As per the report of the fire department, several factories are being run in the narrow lanes of the city and that too without obtaining no objection certificate. Chief fire officer Mahendra Pratap Singh while talking to TOI said, “Old congested areas of the city are more vulnerable to fire because it becomes very difficult for fire brigades to enter such areas to douse flames and start the rescue operation.” He said Anwarganj, Bajaria, Sisamau, Nayaganj, Badshahi Naka, Heeraman Ka Purwa, Chamanganj, Beconganj, Rail Bazar, Colonelganj Macharia, Babupurwa, Begumpurwa, etc are some of the areas of the city which had been converted into commercial centres where the narrow roads and lanes are crowded. “It is the duty of the district administration and the Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC) authorities to take action against the factories being run in the residential areas of the city without obtaining NOC from the fire brigade department”, Singh said. When asked how the fire brigade department would control a fire incident taking place in narrow lanes, he said the department would have to depend on its old system, that vehicles carrying water are parked on the main street and then tubes and water genes are spread up to the spot to sprinkle water. He said the fire brigade department had already identified spots like malls, hotels ad direct lines of the waterworks from where it can get water immediately and that too with good pressure. When asked about hydrants, he said it was an old system given by the Britishers. Now, most of the hydrants had either been bulldozed by the residents or have been occupied illegally while some had been disconnected. “The fire department does not rely on hydrants because malls and hotels are reliable sources of continuous water supply with pressure”, he further said. The fire department now has a modern equipment called Turn Table Ladder ( TTL) which is a folding ladder that can rise up to 42 metres. But this equipment cannot be used in most parts of the city due to electric wires and narrow roads, said a source in the fire department. "

Lucknow,Green whip: UP government nod must to chop off 29 tree species,"LUCKNOW: Facing criticism for easing norms for tree felling on private land, UP government on Monday nullified its 2017 amendment to the UP Tree Preservation Act, 1976. The government has now made permission mandatory for felling of 29 species of trees against six stipulated in 2017. Tightening rules, the government said 10 trees would have to be planted in place of each tree felled from the list of 29 species. The 2017 notification had laid down for plantation of two saplings for each tree felled. The forest department will also provide facility for certification of trees on private land. The trees which can no longer be cut without permission even on private land include mango, neem, sal, mahua, beeja sal, peepal, banyan, goolar, pakad, arjun, palash, bel, chiraunji, khirni, kaitha, tamarind, jamun, asna, kusum, reetha, bhilawa, toon, salai, haldu, bakli, khair, sheesham and sagaon. Species which enjoyed protection in the 2017 amendment were mango, neem, sal, mahua, khair and sagaon. According to the order, those applying for tree felling will have to plant 10 saplings against each tree felled, preferably on their own land. If they do not have sufficient land for compensatory plantation, applicants will have to pay the forest department to ensure plantation on its own land on their behalf. The 2017 amendment, which eased tree felling rule, had stated: “Felling of trees on private land in 62 districts of the state barring mango, neem, sal, mahua and khair is allowed and requires no permission. Similarly, felling of trees by farmers on private land in 13 districts of the state, barring mango, neem, sal, mahua, khair, sagaon and sheesham, is allowed and requires no permission.” "
Lucknow,"Lucknow University to shun MCQ-based test, revert to descriptive exams","LUCKNOW: After experimenting with the concept for two sessions, Lucknow University is set to do away with multiple-choice question (MCQ) pattern in undergraduate examinations from next academic session. A proposal in this regard will be placed before the academic council meeting scheduled later this month. MCQ system was introduced in 2018-2019 by the then vice-chancellor SP Singh despite stiff opposition from a section of teachers who maintained that the new pattern would kill the comprehensive skill of students and their ability to write long prose and explanations, required in most of the subjects at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, would be compromised. The proposal to scrap MCQ system was mooted following the recommendation of all the faculties. “After evaluating the concept for two years, most teachers have concluded that subjective pattern of examination may not be perfect but is better than MCQ system,” said LU spokesman Durgesh Srivastava. When MCQ-based examination was introduced, it was said that the new system would help students prepare for competitive examinations and students would have to go through the entire syllabus to prepare for the examination instead of cramming a few topics from which questions were frequently asked. Teachers said competitive examinations test the intelligence and knowledge of basics of various topics whereas undergraduate and postgraduate studies require thorough knowledge of subjects and skills to explain them in writing. According to them, the subjective pattern makes students ready not only for competitive examinations but also for career in academics, research, and civil and judicial services. Teachers found that students were resorting to guess work in MCQ-based examination. They said in the long run, MCQs would get repetitive in nature and students would be able to clear examinations by merely cramming question papers of previous years. "
Lucknow,UP: Vehicle runs over two men changing tyre of truck,"LUCKNOW: In yet another hit-and-run case, two youths accompanying a truck driver were mowed down by a speeding vehicle in Gosainganj while they were replacing the vehicle’s tyre on Monday. Police said the incident took place when the duo, Afzal (21) and Shahnawaz (20), were replacing the tyre of their truck. At least 15 hit-and-run cases have been reported in the city since January which have claimed 19 lives so far. Sub-inspector, Gosaiganj, Sameer Javed said, “Afzal and Shahnawaz of Fatehpur, along with driver Sonu, had come to Gosainganj on Sunday to deliver a consignment in Transport Nagar. “On Monday morning, the trio left Rae Bareli. Around 6am, the tyre of their truck burst on Shaheed Path. While Shahnawaz lifted the truck with the help of a jack, Afzal started replacing the tyre. Suddenly, a speeding vehicle ran over them,” Javed said. “Their bodies got trapped in the bumper of the vehicle and got dragged for about 700 metres before hitting a divider,” he said. Driver Sonu and some commuters tried to chase the vehicle but failed. The duo were taken to a private hospital where they were pronounced dead on arrival. Javed said an FIR on charges of causing death by negligence and rash driving has been registered. CCTV cameras installed in the area are being scanned to trace the vehicle. Eyewitnesses claimed the duo lay in a pool of blood for over 30 minutes as cops reached the spot late despite repeated calls. “At least two highway patrol vehicles should be there to keep a vigil and check speeding vehicles,” the truck driver said.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Share trading firm owner defrauded investors of Rs 50 lakh,"LUCKNOW: Owner of a private stock broking firm and his staff members were booked by Aashiana police on charges of duping investors of Rs 50 lakh. A former employee of the firm blew the lid off the fraud and lodged an FIR at Aashiana police station on Monday. Santosh Kumar of Krishna Nagar, who worked with the company in 2017, said he was asked by the owner of the company, Nitin, to convince people about attractive returns that they may earn by investing in a scheme of the company. “Between July 2017 and December 2018, I convinced 600 investors to join the scheme.

Kanpur,Lucknow: No meat to be sold for 25 days near Defence Expo venue,"LUCKNOW: More than 35,000 residents living along the 10.9km route between the airport and Vrindavan Colony on Kanpur Road will not be able to purchase meat and fish from retailers in local markets for 25 days. From January 15, the area has been declared a low-fly zone for the air show which will be conducted by the Indian Air Force on this stretch during the 11th Defence Expo scheduled in the city from February 4-9. Fighter planes participating in the show will take off from and land at CCS airport in Amausi. They will fly low until they reach an open ground in Vrindavan Colony, above which the air show will be performed. According to rules, the 7km periphery of the take-off and landing sites, the venue of the air show and the low-fly zone have to be free from meat and fish shops because waste thrown from these shops often attracts birds and increases the threat of a bird colliding with a plane. Even roadside vendors selling eggs or meat items and food vans will be removed from the stretch for the duration. In compliance of safety rules, Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), the nodal government agency for making preparations for the defence expo, has issued directions to shut all shops selling meat and fish on the 10.9km stretch. The area houses an estimated 220 small meat shops and vendors, all of which will be removed from January 15 to February 9. Prominent areas on the stretch inlude Amausi, Transportnagar, Sarojininagar, Banthra, some parts of LDA Colony on Kanpur Road, SGPGI, Uthretia, Vrindavan Colony, Telibagh, Shaheed Path, Ambedkarnagar and Aashiana. “The date of closure is 20 days ahead of the event so that LMC has enough time to conduct drives and take action against defaulters,” said LMC chief veterinary officer Arvind Rao. “We might also order closure of all meat and fish shops in the city from Feb 4-9 during the defence expo. The decision will be taken after assessment of the safety situation later,” he added. The expo will be held at two venues. While the air show will be held in Vrindavan Colony , Indian Navy’s marine commandos will perform in the river Gomti on a 1,9km stretch between Hanuman Setu and Khatu Shyam temple. An exhibition of tanks, arms and other defence equipment with several national and international companies will also be set up on the stretch. People are waiting eagerly for the mega defence expo show but the closure of meat and fish shops will lead to some difficulties. The worst hit will be the shop owners because they are already facing a crisis after closure of slaughterhouses in the city in March 2017. “According to records, there were around 800 registered retail meat shops in the city which had a no-objection certificate from LMC and were registered with the Food Safety and Drug Administration till March 2017. However, around 600 applied for renewal of licence, of which 250 got clearance, said LMC. The three slaughterhouses of the city were closed in 2014-15 because they did not fulfil pollution norms prescribed by the National Green Tribunal. One of them continued to operate in an unauthorised manner till March 2017 before being shut down permanently. Around 70% of the city’s 35 lakh population is non-vegetarian and consumes around 64,000kg of meat daily. "

Lucknow,More than half of the country’s sugar came from UP this year,"LUCKNOW: Owing to a number of reasons, UP has attained the distinction of accounting for more than half of the total sugar production in the country for this year. The data, from Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), is for the period till November-end. According to ISMA, as many as 111 sugar mills were operating in UP till November end, producing 10.8 lakh tonnes of sugar. The country’s total sugar production for the year was 18.8 lakh tonnes. This, however, was half of the 40 lakh tonnes of sugar India produced in 2018. In UP, 105 sugar mills were in operation in 2018, producing 9.1 lakh tonnes. This year, sugar production in UP jumped by more than 18%. Nationally, as compared to 418 sugar factories which were crushing sugarcane on November 30, 2018, only 279 were crushing sugarcane on the same date this year. Maharashtra, which has been a strong competitor of UP in sugar production, saw cane crushing start as late as November 22 this year, because of the devastating floods that hit the state. The western state, which had 175 sugar mills in operation last year, saw only 43 in crushing mode this year, producing 67,000 tonnes of sugar. In 2018, the state had produced 18.8 lakh tonnes of sugar. According to ISMA, Karnataka had 61 sugar mills in operation, producing 5.2 lakh tonnes of sugar. This was much lesser than last year when 8.4 lakh tonnes of sugar was produced by 63 mills in the state. Gujarat, too, saw delayed crushing of cane due to excess rainfall. According to ISMA, 14 sugar mills were crushing on November 30 this year, producing 75,000 tonnes of sugar. Last year, 16 sugar mills in the state produced 2 lakh tonnes of sugar during the same period. "
Lucknow,Unnao rape case: Victim’s autopsy report yet to reach police,"LUCKNOW: The postmortem examination report of the Unnao gang rape and burns victim is yet to reach Unnao police even 48 hours after the procedure was conducted. The 23-year-old woman had died of a cardiac arrest in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Friday night. Forensic experts said that the postmortem examination report was an essential document to establish the pattern of burn marks on the body of the victim. The analysis of the injuries could determine whether she set herself ablaze or it was an act of others. Unnao SP Vikrant Vir confirmed to TOI that he was yet to receive the postmortem report from Delhi. Vir also said he had sought a special service to expedite the process. Police sources said that the victim, in her dying declaration, had mentioned that the five accused had set her ablaze. The accused, meanwhile, have alleged they were at their residences at the time of the incident. The victim, in her dying declaration, had categorically stated that she was on way to catch a train for Rae Bareli when the five accused accosted er. They surrounded her and hit her with a stick on her leg and stabbed her in the neck with a knife. Later, they set her ablaze after pouring petrol on her. The postmortem report will bear scientific testimony to these allegations and counter-allegations of both the accused and the victim. Police, though, have confirmed that prima facie, the location of the five accused was found to be near the victim on the fateful day. Meanwhile, referring to a viral message about a WhatsApp chat between the victim and her lawyer, Vir said that the reports or the chat content was irrelevant to the crime that took place on December 5. In the message, the victim and the lawyer are allegedly talking about a monetary settlement with the accused.

Kanpur,UP government clears decks for 144 fast track courts for rape cases,"LUCKNOW: The state will soon have 144 fast track courts for cases of rapes and another 74 to deal with sexual crimes against children under the Pocso Act. This comes in the wake of a spate of rape cases reported from across the state, including the case of a victim burned alive by the perpetrators in Unnao last week. The UP cabinet on Monday cleared a proposal to set up a total of 218 fast track courts for cases of rapes and sexual crimes against children. Referring to Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s announcement on Sunday that 400 fast track courts will be set up across the country, UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said that state had already rolled out the plan. “Jo desh kal sochta hai woh UP pehle sochta hai. UP thinks before the country,” he said. Law minister Brajesh Pathak said that the proposal had been under works for several days but with the Unnao rape case wherein the victim was set on fire by the perpetrators and finally lost her life, the government decided to push the matter. “We have a huge pendency of cases right now and only 81 fast track courts. These courts were not dedicated to handling rape cases but take on all other kinds of women’s issues as well. Now, we have proposed to start 144 fast track courts for rapes and another 74 to handle Pocso cases of sexual crimes against children,” the minister said. As per data shared by Pathak, 42,379 cases of sexual crimes against children and 25,749 of crimes against women are pending in UP courts. The government has calculated an annual cost of Rs165 crore for the 218 courts that it has proposed to set up. For this, the government also wrote to the Centre and Allahabad High Court on Monday, informing them of the details of its proposal. “An official of additional district judge and sessions judge level will be appointed in each court and will get a staff of seven assistants. Where buildings are not available, the cabinet has also cleared the proposal to hire buildings at a maximum rent of Rs3.90 lakh per year,” said Pathak. The government has fixed the maximum cost of Rs75 lakh per year per court, including the rent. As per the proposal, 60% of the cost will be borne by the Centre and the remaining 40% by the state. Pathak said that while the government had put the process in motion, the courts would be set up upon approval from the Allahabad HC. “The government only has to provide the infrastructure. It is finally the court’s call on how soon the (fast track) courts can become functional,” he said. Praising the existing fast track courts in Auraiya, Kanpur and Meerut, Pathak added that these had been doing exceptional work and had even meted out punishment in five days, including life imprisonment.

Where buildings are not available, the cabinet has also cleared the proposal to hire buildings at a maximum rent of Rs3.90 lakh per year,” said Pathak. The government has fixed the maximum cost of Rs75 lakh per year per court, including the rent. As per the proposal, 60% of the cost will be borne by the Centre and the remaining 40% by the state. Pathak said that while the government had put the process in motion, the courts would be set up upon approval from the Allahabad HC. “The government only has to provide the infrastructure. It is finally the court’s call on how soon the (fast track) courts can become functional,” he said. Praising the existing fast track courts in Auraiya, Kanpur and Meerut, Pathak added that these had been doing exceptional work and had even meted out punishment in five days, including life imprisonment.

Lucknow,UP: Two accused to undergo another lie test,"LUCKNOW: The special investigation team (SIT), probing the mysterious death of Class XI girl student of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Mainpuri, will conduct a second lie detector and polygraph tests on the school’s male science teacher and warden. The duo is among the five accused in the case and is currently in judicial custody. The tests were scheduled on Monday but were deferred to Tuesday as SIT sleuths wanted to add more questions. The tests will be held at Forensic Science Laboratory in Mahanagar, Lucknow. The lie detector and polygraph tests of the five accused were held on December 5. Later, sources had told TOI that the teacher and warden were likely to be put through the tests again as there were contradictions in their statements in the tests and during interrogation. Meanwhile, police also collected the blood samples and body material, including nails, of 16 persons for body profiling. They included victim’s classmatess, faculty, menial staff and four members of her family. These samples will be matched with the stains found on the victim’s innerwear. "
Lucknow,"Cheating hacks at LU: 24 chits in marker, notes on admit cards","Lucknow: From micro-notes on admit cards to mini-scrolls in wristwatches, examinees of Lucknow University (LU) have always had cheat codes up their sleeves. A science undergraduate, however, hogged the spotlight recently for cramming 24 chits inside a 15-inch-tall marker pen. When the female student of a reputable college arrived at the examination hall, invigilators thought the marker was meant to highlight answers. Nevertheless, the abnormal size of the pen struck as odd to one member of the flying squad. “Students do bring markers to exams, but these are usually as tall as a regular pen. This one was pretty large, the type mostly used by artists. So, a squad member decided to take a look. As soon as she opened the cap, chits popped out. In total, 24 chits written in shorthand/abbreviations and covering various topics from the syllabus were found stuffed inside the marker,” a flying squad member told TOI. In another case, a BCom student of PG College was found carrying chits neatly rolled and inserted between the strap of his watch and his wrist. “We recovered two chits from him,” said a squad member. Daya Shankar, an LU assistant professor and member of the invigilating squad, said admit cards were routinely used for cheating. Since these are now available online, examinees take as many printouts as they need. One is used to gain entry to the exam hall while the others are turned into micro-notes. “Generally, admit cards are not checked once an exam begins. Many students take advantage of this. However, after coming across a couple of cases, we have started checking admit cards even during exams. We were surprised to find how popular a method of cheating it is,” the assistant professor said. If boys prefer to tuck micro-notes into watches, girls use handkerchief and clothes such as dupatta, salwar, shawls and jackets as cover. “Normally, chits are attached to the answer sheets as evidence and sealed before students are booked for unfair means. When notes are scribbled on clothes, gathering evidence becomes a challenge. We are taking photographs to retain proof,” said a female member of the squad. "

Lucknow,I proudly tell everyone that I am from a city jahan se Bachchan ji jaise kalakar nikle hain: Tahir Raj Bhasin,"It was actor Tahir Raj Bhasin’s first visit to Lucknow. The 'Chhichore' actor was recently in the city for a seminar at the Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow. Excited about his debut on stage as a speaker at IIM-Lucknow, in an exclusive interview with us done at the campus post the seminar, the Mardani actor shared about his interaction with the students, his UP connect, Bollywood journey and how life has changed after the success of his last film... Is this your first visit to Lucknow?I have been to Prayagraj before but not to Lucknow. This is my first visit here but I know Prayagraj quite well since a large part of my childhood was spent there as being in the Indian Air Force, my dad was posted there. What I know about Lucknow is that a lot of film shootings are happening here. And as an actor now it is a dream of mine to come to Lucknow and shoot here. We actors are really stressed of the kind of food we get when shooting in different cities but Lucknow mein shoot karte time that I am sure, for any actor it will not be a thing to worry about as yahan ka khana is famous every where. I have friends in Lucknow who have promised to take me for a Lakhnawi khaane ki treat of some mouth-watering kebabs. So what memories do you have of Prayagraj?I went to Boys’ High School in the year 1996 when I was in class VI. I have amazing memories of this city. Prayagraj is the first place where in school I performed on the first time on stage while participating in elocution and poetry. Everyone’s childhood is special and the palace where it is spent too is a special one. So for me Prayagraj holds a special place in my heart. I remember living in Civil line and travelling in tempos. Every time we had a family visiting us from another city, we used to go to Sangam. I have taken several dips in the Sangam. As a child it was so fascinating to live in a colourful city like Prayagraj which had so many stories to it. Also meri zubaan jo itni saaf hai Hindi mein is because I lived there. Also since Amitabh Bachchan ji is from Prayagraj, I proudly tell everyone that I am from a city jahan se Bachchan ji jaise kalakar nikle hain. I remember going for an exhibition to Anand Bhawan, the home of Jawahar Lal Nehru. Tahir Raj Bhasin (inset) was seen as Derek in Chhichhore (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Tahir Raj Bhasin (inset) was seen as Derek in Chhichhore (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) How was it addressing the students at IIM Lucknow?I was really very excited about this. The topic was social media influence today. I told them about my Bollywood journey. They asked me some really good questions too. I tried my best not to give a moral lecture to them. I told them how we actors are also creative entrepreneurs and how we are our own brand and our own CEOs. I told them how we pitch ourselves in the industry. I tried my best to be at their level and conceptualise with them emotionally. Most things were impromptu. An interesting question by a student was that how much of social media is important for me today? i told them that while I would like to put out most stuff from my professional engagements like coming to IIM and giving this interview today, I would definitely like to draw a line on what stuff I wouldn’t post online from my private life. I am intentionally not doing things to gain followers on social media. Coming back to you acting journey, it started off from doing theatre in Delhi.Theatre for me was discovering that I have this talent of acting. I did theatre with Barry John in Delhi when I was 15 years old. So when Barry sir, who has taught actors like Shah Rukh Khan and Manoj Bajpayee, told me that I have potential to make it in Bollywood, it was motivation of another level. Also performing in front of a live audience is always very exhilarating because there are no retakes and you have to be pitch perfect. So theatre in short, helps an actor overcome performance pressure. Tahir Raj Bhasin (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Tahir Raj Bhasin (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) What was that moment in your life when you realised you want to be an actor?I went to Australia to study film making and when I saw the level of detailing that goes into creating a scene and the intricacies with which one has to deliver a line – I was like wow! For me it was a mix of philosophy, psychology and art. During that time I made a switch to foray completely into acting. My parents though were concerned on how I will make a living out of this, they were supportive. However, when they first came to watch the first screening of Mardani, my mom was in tears. I asked her if she didn’t like the film or me. And she replied saying no, not at all! She told me that it was a very proud moment for her to see me with an actress like Rani Mukerji. How has life changed after the success of your films Mardani and now Chhichore?As they say in Mumbai, my life changed on a Friday, with the release of Mardani and now Chhichore. After the release of Mardani, suddenly from a struggling actor giving auditions, I became an actor. I no longer had to pick up the phone and make an introduction that ‘Hi I am Tahir’. Mardani was a crime thriller, Manto after that was a period biopic, Force 2 was an action film, Chhichore has been a college drama and my next will be a sports film. So in a short span of seven years into the industry to do different parts is great. For me, I want to keep surprising the audience by doing different work. "

Kanpur,Two arrested in grocery shop owner murder case,"Kanpur: Police have arrested two men allegedly involved in battering to death a 55-year-old grocery shop owner in Ghatampur area of the district on the night of November 1. In order to conceal the crime, the assailants had dug up a pit and buried the body of the victim. Police had identified the deceased as Ram Bahadur Singh Rana, a resident of Kundauli village in Ghatampur. The arrested criminals have been identified as Raj Kumar and Dharmendra. SP (Rural) Pradyumna Singh told TOI that after their arrest, when a police team, following inputs provided by the two assailants, had gone to recover the firearm, Dharmendra tried to escape after opening fire from the firearm which he had hidden in the area after the crime. In retaliatory action by the police, Dharmendra suffered injuries and slumped on the ground. He was later arrested and admitted to a hospital amid tight police security, while Raj Kumar has been sent to jail. According to police, Ram Bahadur Rana, a resident of Kundauli village in Ghatampur, used to run a grocery shop at Kundauli crossing. “On November 1 night, while he was asleep under a tin shade outside his shop, the miscreants attacked him with blunt objects repeatedly till he succumbed to wounds. When he died, the assailants dug up a pit in nearby fields and buried his body in it and escaped thereafter,” said a police official. The incident came to light on early November 2 morning after his family members reached the shop, and on finding him missing from the cot, alerted the police control room. The police rushed to the spot and later recovered his body from a newly dug up pit. "

Kanpur,"We must protect Ganga, it is our heritage: Admn","Kanpur: District magistrate Vijay Vishwas Pant, speaking at a seminar on ‘Ganga conservation’ at CSM University here on Monday said, “Ganga is our heritage and it is our duty to protect the river”. He said as Ganga plays an important role in conserving the environment, it is high time that the government formulates a policy to control pollution in order to save the environment. “When Britishers went back to their country, they took Ganga water with them and the Indian pilgrims, after returning from a pilgrimage, also bring Ganga water with them because its water has a strength to stay fresh forever”, the DM said. Municipal commissioner Akshay Tripathi in his address said beliefs of scores of Indians are attached with Ganga. “It is not just a river but is like our mother which sustains us. It gives us too much but in return people give it effluent of their houses, sewer and garbage. We must change our habits and make the river as pure as it used to be in the past”, he said. Chief development officer Sunil Kumar Singh said awareness should be created among people to keep intact our valuable heritage. Prof Neelima Gupta, vice-chancellor of Kanpur University, director NSI, Prof Narendra Mohan and Sita Ram Tagore, a senior environmentalist also expressed their views at the seminar. Students, officials and teachers of various colleges also attended the event. "
Lucknow,Meat shops at Amausi make flights vulnerable to bird hits,"LUCKNOW: Commercial flights operating from Chaudhary Charan Singh (CCS) Airport have been under constant threat of bird-hit due to illegal meat shops operating near the airport for years. However, Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) has turned a blind eye towards these illegal shops. TimesViewSuch illegal meat shops are open invitation to accident. Though no major untoward incident has occurred, it does not mean that safety norms can be ignored. LMC should inspect the area regularly to clear illegal shops. At the same time, it should provide a place to the shop owners in no vending and safe zones with the facility of waste collection at door step.After reports that all meat shops will be shut for 25 days in the 7km periphery of the low-fly zone created for Defence Expo, frequent flyers in the city said that the municipal body should enforce the rule permanently. A 10.9km route from Amausi to Vrindavan Yojna will be declared low-fly zone for the air show for the expo from February 4-9 to check any possibility of bird-hit. Airport officials said that though no bird-hit incident had taken place over the past year, they have been requesting LMC to remove all illegal meat shops in the vicinity. “LMC had last cleared the area in March 2017, but unauthorised shops were back soon,” said an official. According to Aircraft Rules, 1937, section 91, slaughtering and flaying of animals, depositing of rubbish and other polluted or obnoxious matter and meat and fish shops in the 10km periphery of an airport is completely prohibited because these attract birds and animals, posing threat to aircraft. In a year, around 25,000 commercial and private aircraft operate through Amausi airport. In a reality check within a 10km periphery of the airport on Tuesday, TOI found 37 meat/fish shops and kiosks in Amausi, Transportnagar, Aashiana, among others. Owners said they had a licence earlier but it was not renewed because LMC refused to give no-objection certificates to them in 2017. LMC said these shops were flouting NGT norms. Muneeb, who has a meat shop 3km from the airport, said, “We operate without licence because it’s a question of our livelihood. We keep all animal waste in a dustbin and dispose it of in the evening, far away from the airport.” Businessman Dr Manoj Shukla, a frequent flyer, said there were several meat shops near the airport and instead of waiting for airport authorities to ask, LMC should clear them. Rashid Ali, also a frequent flyer, said that if an accident had not taken place till now, it did not mean that it would not take place in the future. “LMC should ensure safety 24x7,” he said. However, LMC chief veterinary officer Arvind Rao denied negligence on the part of the civic body. “We conduct regular drives in that area and most shops have either been shifted or removed. The remaining will be removed by next month,” he said. "
Lucknow,Lucknow must scale Mt Garbage to improve swachh ranking,"LUCKNOW: Ranking parameters for Swachh Bharat Survekshan 2020 have been revised to put more emphasis on sanitation and cleanliness, which effectively means shoddy garbage management may cost Lucknow dear in the pan-India survey scheduled around a month from now. The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, in the revised parameters released recently, has increased marks for the services provided by a municipal body from 25% to over 30%. And, Lucknow has always fared poorly in swachh ranking owing to inept garbage handling by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC).  In 2019, the total marks of 5,000 was equally divided among the four parameters—service level progress, direct observation, citizen feedback and open defecation free (ODF) status—with each being allotted 1,250. The city scored 2,746 points (54.92%) with lowest in service level progress—259 out of 1,250—because garbage management was poor. It received 899 points in direct observation, 988 in citizen feedback and 600 in ODF status to rank 115 among 410 cities. In 2018, too, the city had scored 2,746 points out of 5,000 and ranked 121 among 413 cities. Even then, the performance in service level progress was poor. For 2020, the total marks is 6,000. Service level progress has been allotted 2,000 marks; direct observation and citizen feedback 1,300 marks each; and ODF status has 1,400. In short, LMC will have to go all out to ensure 100% cleanliness in the city for a decent score. However, TOI reality check over the past week indicates that the civic body is staring at a Herculean task. Out of 1,600 metric tonne of garbage generated daily in the city, around 1,440 metric tonne is collected. Approximately, 60% houses out of 5.48 lakh are covered under door-to-door garbage collection service. The frequency of dumpsters on roadside is every 2km against swachh guidelines of every 500 metre. Also, public complaints on garbage lifting are not being attended to even after the launch of a command centre to address civic grievances. In some areas like Jankipuram, garbage collection by the LMC exists only on paper, forcing residents to hire private workers. LMC environment engineer Pankaj Bhushan had a stock reply. “We have already started installing dustbins in more areas. Eco-green has been directed to increase the ambit of their door-to-door collection service. We will improve on all fronts in the coming month,” he said. "
Lucknow,"Accused undergo 2nd lie test, cops mull narco test too","Lucknow: A male teacher and the lady warden of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Mainpuri were put through another lie detector and polygraph tests at the Forensic Science Laboratory in Mahanagar, Lucknow, on Tuesday. The special investigation team (SIT), which is probing the case, also quizzed the warden for over five hours on Tuesday. The warden had slapped the victim three years ago in the school for allegedly stealing some food packets. She had then ordered 48 students of the victim’s class to slap the girl. The duo is among the five accused in the mysterious death of Class XI girl of of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mainpuri. Sources said the accused underwent the tests separately where they were asked 60 questions prepared by the investigators. Each session continued for an hour. Senior police officers said based on the preliminary investigations and statements of the accused, no clear picture or sequence of the events about the crime scene has emerged so far. A senior police officer said the answers of the accused in two tests were similar. The officer said they will wait for the reports of the blood sample and the DNA test of the accused and if they are found inconclusive then the police may apply for their Narco test. The warden was questioned as a note recovered from the victim’s room said: “never forgiven and subjected to humiliation”. However, SIT is yet to get a report whether it was the victim’s handwriting on the note recovered. The 16-year-old girl was found hanging in her school in September this year. Police had claimed it was a case of suicide but her family alleged she was raped and murdered. "
Lucknow,15 lakh rural women to boost income by recovering power dues in Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW: Over 15 lakh rural women associated with self-help groups would be able to substantially enhance their income after they are engaged by the government to recover power dues in vast swathes of the rural hinterland. While this will expedite dues recovery from defaulters and raise revenue for the power corporation, it will augment rural earnings in a big way. “No other state has taken such a big step to open employment opportunity for distressed rural women, who can now earn at least Rs 1,000 over and above their income,” said energy minister Shrikant Sharma. The energy department has given over 1.2crore power connections to rural households in the state under the Centre’s flagship Saubhagya scheme. But realisation of bills from rural consumers was becoming a challenge for UP Power Corporation Limited with 70% households either delaying or refusing to foot bills. Talking to TOI, energy minister Shrikant Sharma said, “With a strain on coffers, we decided to engage women’s self-help groups in rural areas to recover power dues from rural consumers. We will work closely with these groups.” On an average, there are 15 women members in every self-help group in rural Uttar Pradesh. And there are over 1lakh SHGs in the state. “Women members would receive Rs 20 for every paid bill and if anybody realises 50 power dues a month, she earns Rs 1,000 a month as additional income,” the minister said. The energy minister said the pilot project has already been launched in four cities of Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Mathura and the response has been impressive and will be implemented across the state. “There is no such a big programme for uplift of rural women in any other state. This initiative would help rural women and also boost recovery of dues from rural consumers. While the corporation has raised tariff, consumers are getting adequate power too. Now, the focus would be on recovery of dues in rural-urban and industry-commercial sections. We cannot afford to burden honest consumers who are regularly paying bills. We have to target defaulters to increase our daily revenue,” he said. "

Lucknow,"Yogi Adityanath calls for uniform academic syllabus for state boards, religious institutions across country","LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday underlined the need for uniform syllabus in educational institutions across the country. ""Schools run by CBSE, state boards and religious institutions have different syllabi and this disrupts academic uniformity among students at the national level,"" said the chief minister. He said the Constitution grants equal rights, but there’s a need for equality in education. Addressing the inaugural session of the two-day “School Summit” in Lucknow on Wednesday, he said inequality in education remains a big challenge. ""Jo shiksha kisi samaj aur rashtra ke sabsey adhaar-poorn stambh ke roop mein honi chahiye … jab hum swayam usmein ek samanta nahi la paye hain ...toh ussay nikalne wale nagriko ke mann mein ek samanta la payen yeh chunauti hamesha bani rahe hai aur bani rahegi (When we ourselves have not been able to bring equality in education, the main pillar of society ... then how we can bring an equality in minds of citizens. It’s a big challenge to bring equality among citizens where education is unequal,” he said. He said there should be an initiative to bring consensus among states for implementing uniform syllabus. “Questions may be raised on whether we are restricting education and acting as a barrier in the development of society. We have to look at the difference and inequality in syllabi implemented by state boards, CBSE and religious boards. Students are at the receiving end as CBSE syllabus is given priority in national-level exams,” he said. Minister of state for basic education (independent charge) Satish Dwivedi said data for NITI Ayog’s school education quality index (SEQI) was collected before March 2017 during the tenure of the previous government. “Kerala tops the SEQI list while UP hugs the lowest rank. Poor infrastructure has a big role to play. We have started ‘kayakalp’ to revamp schools and have already renovated 90,000 schools,” he said. The minister said, the current government is trying to remove negative perception about government primary schools, which was triggered by the apathetic attitude of earlier governments. Dwivedi also called on corporates to invest in school as a future expansion plan. "
Lucknow,Lucknow University suspends two teachers after LLB semester III paper leak,"LUCKNOW: The LLB semester III examination was cancelled and two law teachers suspended on Wednesday after the paper leak snowballed into a huge embarrassment for the Lucknow University brass on its centenary year. Vice-chancellor S K Shukla admitted to reporters at a hurriedly convened press conference that several question papers of third semester exam conducted in first week of December had been leaked. The crackdown followed just hours after six audio clips went viral in which two male voices can be heard leaking questions to a woman, ahead of the examination. The male voices are suspected to be of two law faculty members and the female voice is being allegedly attributed to the chairperson of a medical college, who’s also enrolled as student of LLB third semester. Late evening, an FIR was registered at Hasanganj police station against three persons. “Richa Mishra and Ashok Kumar have been named in the FIR and the third accused is unidentified. We are yet to match the voice in the audio clips. We have launched a probe after registering a case under Uttar Pradesh Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 1998,” said LU police outpost in charge, Abhay Kumar Singh. Shukla, who is officiating as vice-chancellor due to delay in appointment of a regular incumbent, announced that two teachers were suspended because prima facie evidence (audio clip) points to their involvement. “After hearing audio clips, it’s clear questions of several papers of LLB semester III were leaked, compromising the sanctity of the exam process. Fresh dates of the exam will be announced later,” he said. “A two-member committee comprising Prof (retired) SK Dwivedi and former controller of examination Prof (retired) Chaman Mehrotra has been formed to probe the paper leak. I will also write to the state government to order a CBCID probe,” he said. The vice-chancellor also said Rs 5-lakh fine has been imposed on the LU-affiliated private law college and it has been blacklisted as an examination centre. “We also sought CCTV footage and DVR tapes from the college, but nothing was found due to a glitch in cameras,” said Shukla.

Lucknow,"Citizenship (Amendment) Bill passed, Sindhi migrants from Pakistan dream life of dignity","LUCKNOW: Shrichand Sahitya was just 17 when his family left behind a “horrific world” in Pakistan and settled in Lucknow in 1999. Sahitya’s ancestors used to live in Sukkur (in Sindh province of Pakistan) but after Partition they were treated as refugees in their own country. Recalling the horror, Sahitya, now 37, said: “We were treated as alien, looked down upon and harassed. Many Sindhi women were kidnapped. For 50 years, my ancestors and parents faced harassment. Finally, we decided to migrate to India. We felt safe and happy but a sense of identity was missing as we couldn’t acquire Indian citizenship.” Sahitya’s family is among 10,000 Sindhi families which migrated to Lucknow between 1950 and 2000 following persecution in Pakistan. Many got citizenship in due course of time but nearly 200 families which migrated to Lucknow after 1970 are yet to get Indian citizenship. After the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) was passed on Wednesday, these families hope that they will be able to get Indian citizenship. According to Sindhi families, the waiting period was 12 years and required lot of documents. The condition that applicant’s relatives should be residing locally was also an obstacle as many who migrated had no blood relatives in Lucknow. Without citizenship, the families were not able to buy property, get a passport/driving licence, government job, and even electricity connection. Ramdev Haswani (53) of Krishnanagar left his house in Sindh (Pakistan) 30 years ago due to constant attack on his family members. “There was no security for women. My sisters and mother could not step out of the house since there was constant threat of kidnapping and assault. After coming to India, we had been trying to apply for citizenship but nothing happened. The new law has come as a ray of hope for us,” he said. “It was unfortunate that even after living here for so many years, we were not accepted. Now, whoever migrates to the country will not face hardships,” said Harish Chandani of Alambagh who migrated to the city 25 years ago. Ashok Motiyani of UP Sindhi Samaj said, “Two years ago, around 300 Sindhi families applied for citizenship at a camp organised by the government. However, many of them could not get citizenship due to one reason or the other.” "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Rain likely today, brace for a foggy weekend","LUCKNOW: Cold conditions intensified in the city with minimum temperature dropping below 10 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. Tough days are ahead as the weatherman predicted partly cloudy sky with possibility of thundershowers on Thursday and Friday, followed by chilly and foggy weather Sunday onwards. State Met director JP Gupta said that a western disturbance (WD) has hit northern Himalayas and a cyclonic circulation is hovering over Rajasthan. Track the pollution level in your cityThe two factors will cut off cold winds coming from the hills of Himachal Pradesh but at the same time, are expected to cause rain and thundershowers with lightning at several places in the state. Hailstorm is also expected at isolated places. Lucknow might also witness cloudy sky with some thunder activity accompanied by drizzles on Thursday and Friday. Possibility of rainfall is more on Friday. The maximum temperature will drop due to cloudy sky and rain during this period. Minimum temperature at night will not be affected much because of cloud cover that does not allow heat to escape into the atmosphere. However, moisture-laden winds will increase the chill factor. The WD, which will also cause snowfall in the hills, is expected to fizzle out by Saturday and weather will be clear on Sunday. Thereafter, icy winds from snow-fed mountains of Himachal Pradesh will start sweeping the state and the city, leading to drop in temperature and chilly weather conditions. These winds will also convert moisture left behind in the atmosphere by rain into dense fog that will in turn contribute in intensifying the cold conditions. On Wednesday, the maximum temperature in the city was 24.4 degrees Celsius, a unit below normal, despite sunshine. The minimum temperature was normal at 9.5 degrees Celsius. Moderate fog in the morning led to formation of smog that kept sky hazy all day. Pollution spikes again Wednesday was the most polluted day of the city this month so far with Air Quality Index (AQI) of 362, up by 69 units from 293 on Tuesday, pushing air quality down to ‘very poor’ from ‘poor’ category as per the standards fixed by Central Pollution Control Board. AQI of the city was poor between December 1 and 4 before spiking to very poor from December 5-9. It dropped to ‘poor’ on Tuesday. On Wednesday, moderate fog in the morning combined with pollutants to create smog, leading to deterioration in air quality. The situation might improve on Thursday and Friday due to rainfall. Thereafter, air pollution will increase again from Sunday. "

Lucknow,Bar code to keep tab on garbage collection in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: Keeping the Swachhta survey in mind, Lucknow Municipal Corporation will introduce bar coding through radio frequency identification (RFID) technology from Friday to ensure 100% door-to-door garbage collection in the city. A bar code will be pasted outside every house in the city. According to LMC officials, the process has begun. Sanitary workers will have to scan the code after collecting trash from a house. The scanning will send a message to the civic body’s control room. The system is expected to make sanitary workers cover an entire area without skipping any house. If a worker will not cover the allotted area, the control room will receive a pop-up alert. The system at present is being used by Pune Municipal Corporation under the Smart Cities Mission. LMC has purchased the technology from a Pune-based firm for Rs 10 lakh. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said, “We have received the technology from the firm and the process to paste the QR codes will start this week. The project will be launched on December 20. It will help us improve the city’s swachhta ranking.” Lucknow had been scoring poorly in the All India Swachhta Ranking because of poor waste management.

Lucknow,How a cop catapulted kid labourers to smart classes,"LUCKNOW: It was the inspiration from two teachers who had rescued his mother, a bonded child labourer kept in sickles, that motivated Telangana IPS officer RS Praveen Kumar to become an educator. Opting to work for the marginalised classes, he joined the Telangana Residential Educational Society as secretary on deputation from his IPS duty. The government-run society works for the welfare of underprivileged children across the state. The former Hyderabad joint commissioner of police, Kumar was in Lucknow on Wednesday to speak on innovation in education at the ‘School Summit’ organised by the education department. “The majority of students lived in a thatched muddy one-room house or were working as labourers. The girls would have been married at an early age had they not joined school. Now, they are studying in a smart class, are expressive and reply in English in the Telugu-medium schools,” he said. “My parents suffered a lot due to poverty and social discrimination. Despite this, they helped my brother, sister and me in realising our dreams. I see reflection of my mother in these children and do not want them to suffer,” says the 53-year-old. The society focuses on all-round development of children with academics and extra-curricular activities. Children who once had no access to education are scaling Mount Everest, teaching English in European countries and earning up to Rs 3,500 per lecture by teaching, he said. To make girls independent, Praveen says, communication is key. “I want girls to realize that they have a voice and it is as effective as self-defence. I have placed mirrors in galleries and in classes to get them out of their shells. As part of exchange programmes, they are sent to countries like Poland and Sweden where they teach English,” he said. "

Lucknow,"UP cops using artificial intelligence &amp; mobile application to outwit criminals, maintain vigil","LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh police are using artificial intelligence (AI) to outwit criminals and keep a close eye on them. The cops are relying on video wall to maintain round-the-clock vigil on criminals lodged in jails and a mobile application to keep a database of law-breakers. According to cops, ‘Trinetra App’ (or the third eye), is a mobile application which uses artificial intelligence for face recognition of criminals. The application can be used in any Android mobile phone. The app is equipped with biometric record analysis, phonetic search and gang analysis to zero in on criminals in a quick and targeted manner. Inspector general of police, (law and order) Praveen Kumar said: “Both these technologies will not only act as deterrent but also help in prevention of crime.” Explaining the utility of video wall, director general (prisons) Anand Kumar said, “UP is the first state to implement such a technology to keep an eye on jail inmates. We have established a video wall at prisons headquarters in Lucknow which is linked to about 2,750 CCTV cameras installed in prisons across the state. The CCTVs are equipped with AI which, on noticing any unusual activity inside jails, will not only display it on video wall but also trigger an alarm.” “The alarm is linked to the mobile phones of jail superintendents so that they can act swiftly,” he added. Speaking about ‘Trinetra App’, additional director general of police (technical services) Asim Arun said the application had the database of over 5 lakh criminals bringing together the records of state police and government railway police (GRP). “Cops can use this technology to identify criminals through their face and photographs along with his/her criminal antecedents. The mobile app can also tell the gang to which a criminal belongs just at the press of a button,” added Arun. "

Shirley, also called Pajama Popstar after the title of her song, became an overnight sensation when fans loved her song videos posted online. The New Zealand-born actress and singer, in an exclusive chat with LT, shared about her transition from the internet to Bollywood, about her personal life, upcoming projects and more... How has your experience been of shooting in Lucknow? It’s been really good. I have actually been to Lucknow before to perform at the Lucknow Mahotsav last year. Sadly enough this happens to us all the time, that whenever we go to a city for a performance or for shooting, we do not get time to explore the place and to get its essence. So this was a very lucky experience for me to get an opportunity to visit the city of nawabs. I explored Lucknow a lot this time. We went to the Rumi Gate, the Clock Tower then Ambedkar Park for our shooting. I had some great food here too including the kebabs and Lakhnawi biryani, and also other dishes. Lucknow ki biryani was very different from the Hyderabadi biryani. The biryani here is not very spicy, which was very good kyunki main spicy food zyada kha nahi sakti. I loved it cause everything that I eat was literally melting in my mouth. You must be interacting with a lot of Lucknowites here, did you get to know about the traits of Lucknowites?I really love the way people speak here, it’s very different from the other parts of the country. Bahut hi adab, pyaar aur respect se baat karte hain sab yahan. Matlab jis se bhi aap baat kar rahe ho,whether he’s your driver, crew member, the shop keepers and may be a person working somewhere, everybody speaks with so much respect and there’s just so much nazakat and adab in their way, which is very hard to find in Mumbai. Shirley Setia (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Shirley Setia (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) So tell us about your journey from being an internet star to a Bollywood actor.The video happened just by chance. Honestly speaking, I had no idea that the song will become so popular. I was very much into dancing since my childhood and singing was actually not my forte and I never knew that I had it in me. I haven’t taken any professional training for it. So, to even think that I would be able to make it to the singing industry was surreal. I did this one video which was the cover for Tum Hi Ho in pyjamas, and it went viral. I showed the video to one of my friends and she liked it and then she asked me to post the video online. I never posted it online with the intention of it becoming a hit. Actually, it was a really nerve racking experience for me. But that’s how it all happened and I started doing more covers and learnt how to edit videos. I have dreamt of many things in my life and slowly-slowly they are all happening to me. Because I used to live so far and I have no roots here in Bollywood, it’s all amazing. My dad is an entrepreneur, my mom is a housewife and there’s no relative of mine who lives here in India. How it all began was that one day I got a message from Sabbir Khan’s office that we are looking to meet you. I got super excited and I was like wow. But I was like, is this actually the real person or someone is playing a prank on you. Then I went and gave the audition and was selected. That’s how I bagged this film and I’m loving it. Have you sung for your Bollywood debut Nikkama?Not as of now but hopefully in my future projects, I will. Shirley Setia (BCCL) Shirley perfored at the Lucknow Mahotsav last year (BCCL) Shilpa Shetty is acting in your debut film. Tell us your experience of interacting with her?The first couple of times I interacted with Shilpa ma’am was when we were shooting a song in Mumbai. It was a lot of fun and she’s very sweet. We have danced together and she’s superb. I learnt a lot from her. I have grown up watching her films and now when I look at her, I am very inspired by her. She is very helpful too. She only wants you to improve with every single take of yours. Shirley and Armaan Malik are rumoured to be dating (BCCL/ @ShirleySetia) Shirley and Armaan Malik are rumoured to be dating (BCCL/ @ShirleySetia) How was your experience performing at the Lucknow Mahotsav?It was too much fun. I remember at that time too it was very cold but the amount of energy I got from the crowd took my performance to another level. Rumour mills are abuzz that you are dating Armaan Malik?Armaan and I are good friends, he’s very sweet. We have chilled together while we were touring but I’ve never really thought of him like a date. Of course, I have dated before and have had my share of heartbreaks. Nahi toh fir itni feel nahi aati mere songs mein. Feelings in songs always comes from love and heartbreaks. To be very frank, the guy whom I would like to date should have a good sense of humour and sarcasm. He should be humble and a good human being. I don’t like it when people do not treat other people nicely. So yes, he should be a good human being at heart. — With inputs from Lakshya Nigam "

Speaking to officials and others after reviewing the preparations for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Atal ghat December 14, the CM said the river was much cleaner today due to the Namami Gange programme. The nullah, which had been discharging 140 MLD of sewage waste daily into the Ganga, has now become a selfie point. The CM too took a selfie keeping it in the background. The nullah has been cleaned and its inner walls have been painted. The wastewater is now being diverted to Jajmau and Bingawan sewage treatment plants.

Lucknow,"Lucknow University paper leak crisis deepens, unrest rocks twin campuses","LUCKNOW: A day after cancellation of the LLB Semester III examinations and suspension of two law teachers following question paper leak, Lucknow University (LU) was thrown into turmoil on Thursday with the action triggering unrest among both students and teachers. Third semester students locked the gates of the second campus, forcing the authorities to cancel the LLB Semester V exam scheduled for the day, and later laid siege to the vice-chancellor’s camp office on the old campus. The Lucknow University Teachers’ Association (LUTA) too was up in arms against the action and dubbed the suspension of law faculty members arbitrary. As the student unrest threatened to snowball, heavy police deployment became necessary on the two campuses of the university. Agitated students, who took to the streets and disrupted traffic on the main road outside the old campus, left the scene only after officiating vice-chancellor SK Shukla assured them that their grievances would be sympathetically addressed. The LLB third semester examinations began in the first week of December. Four papers had been held and the rest were scheduled this month. On Wednesday evening, however, the VC cancelled the entire semester after several audio clips went viral on social media. In the clips, two men believed to be law teachers can be heard dictating questions expected in the tests to a woman who is enrolled as a law student and is also the chairperson of a medical college. The decision impacted more than 2,900 students enrolled in Semester III at LU and its associated colleges, evoking strong reactions. Scores of third semester students assembled on the second campus in Jankipuram, which houses the law faculty, on Thursday morning. They locked the main gate, restricting movement of employees and LLB fifth semester examinees. Though police were called, students refused to budge and the blockade continued, prompting the varsity to cancel the day’s test. The disgruntled third semester students then moved to the main campus and began demonstrating outside the VC’s camp office. Raising slogans, they said the paper was leaked to one student but LU had punished the entire batch by cancelling the exams. This, they said, will derail their plans for internships and other activities lined up after the exams. “The varsity can reschedule examinations that have not been held so far, but it must not cancel those already held,” said a protester. “Why are all students being forced to reappear for the exams when LU teachers and a high-profile student are at fault?” asked another.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Stalker thrashes dad, girl poisons herself to death","LUCKNOW: A 17-year-old girl consumed poison at her Thakurganj home after her stalker beat her father up for protesting against his unwelcome overtures. The Class X student was rushed to a nearby government hospital late on Wednesday where she died early on Thursday. Thakurganj SHO Mahesh Pal Singh said an abetment to suicide case had been registered against the accused who had been identified as Nadeem. “A call from Nadeem on Wednesday night upset the girl and she consumed some poisonous substance. She later died in hospital. We have registered an abetment case against Nadeem, but he is on the run,” the officer said. Contrary to police statement that call from Nadeem made the girl took extreme step, victim’s father told TOI that Nadeem routinely harassed her and stalked her to school. “A couple of days ago, she told us about her ordeal but we did not have the courage to go to police fearing the worst,” he said. To protect his daughter, the man nonetheless went to Nadeem’s house on Wednesday to lodge a complaint with his parents. “But, Nadeem beat me up. I somehow managed to escape,” he told TOI. On reaching home, the man found his daughter was apparently so traumatised by his insult that she had consumed poison. CO Chowk DP Tiwari said an inquiry was underway. “The accused will be held and allegations against him probed,” Tiwari added. "
Lucknow,"Cold truths: No bonfires, few shelters for homeless","LUCKNOW: The weather is doubly harsh for the homeless in the city with cold winds intensifying the chill and the civic authorities deciding not to light bonfires amid rising air pollution. As the minimum temperature hovered around 11°C, the icy North Wind made several hundred people living on pavements and other open areas shiver to the bone. While Lucknow Municipal Corporation claimed the homeless were being shifted to 23 shelters that have a combined capacity of 2,000, only 800 had found a roof above their head till Thursday. Also, the number of shelters in the city are far too less compared to the number of people who need a home. The LMC’s own estimate suggests there are more than 5,000 pavement dwellers. NGOs put the figure at over 10,000. “In addition, more than a lakh living in 38 urban slums remain deprived of bonfires and the authorities haven’t offered them alternatives either,” said Ashish Awasthi, an activist working for underprivileged citizens. Until last year, the LMC facilitated bonfires at 365 places, covering more than two lakh people every winter. The bonfires were lit on footpaths, at slums, railway stations, bus depots, crossings, markets, public hostels, tempo and auto stands, under-construction government building sites and religious places, among others. A total of Rs 12.50 lakh was spent on 73 tonne of wood. Additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh said the decision to not light bonfires this time had been taken following an order from the district administration, as burning logs could increase particulate matter and poison gases in the air. “The LMC is shifting at least 100 homeless people daily to the permanent shelters in Hazratganj, Lalbagh, Aminabad, Kaiserbagh, Aishbagh, Raja Bazaar, Rajajipuram, Aliganj and Mahanagar, among others. Constructed for Rs 3.30 crore, the 23 shelters boast drinking water, toilets, beds and blankets. Around 800 have already been housed,” Singh added. Civic officials said another 87 temporary shelters would be set up in different parts of the city with the help of NGOs. A TOI reality check in Chinhat, Matiyari, Niralanagar, Raqabganj, Thakurganj and Rajajipuram revealed that the authorities had a long way to go given the number of people still sleeping on pavements in this biting cold. Some pavement dwellers have begun arranging bonfires on their own. Shailu Kumar, a rickshaw-puller, said they cooked food under a flyover and kept themselves warm after dusk. "
Lucknow,"Wind chill makes Lucknow shiver, but AQI improves","LUCKNOW: Cold winds and light showers made Thursday nippy in the city and if weathermen are to be believed, the chill will intensify further on Friday, courtesy thundershowers and icy blasts from the north. The cloud cover dragged the maximum temperature down to 22.4 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, on Thursday. At the same time, it pushed up the minimum to 11.8 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal, by preventing ground heat from escaping into the atmosphere. Drizzle was reported from some parts of the city during the day. Despite temperatures in Lucknow not being extreme, the day was bitter cold because of wind chill. In other words, body temperatures were lowered by the passing flow of low-temperature air. For instance, the temperature around noon was around 19 degrees Celsius, but the real feel was like 17 degrees Celsius. The blast came from parts of the state where readings have dropped further owing to unseasonal rainfall. The wind velocity also reduced particulate matter in the atmosphere and improved the city’s air quality index from 362 on Wednesday to 312 on Thursday. State Met director JP Gupta said a western disturbance over Jammu and Kashmir and a cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan were responsible for the changes in weather. The skies will, however, clear by Sunday. "
Kanpur,Khaki shame: 10 cops suspended for graft,"LUCKNOW: Ten policemen — ranking from a constable to an inspector — were suspended in four districts in four days for demanding money either to expedite a case or to lodge a false FIR, the numbers stressing how deep the rot of corruption runs in the force. The most recent incident of khaki shame took place in Sambhal district on Wednesday, when Crime Branch inspector Sahdev Singh was caught red-handed demanding Rs 40,000 from a complainant to get his case expedited. The Crime Branch is a special wing that works directly under the district police chief. On the same day, sub-inspectors Faheem Khan and Mahendra Kumar were suspended in Kanpur along with constables Mahesh and Chandravir for demanding Rs 14 lakh to book an innocent person. The SSP has instituted an inquiry before further action. On December 10, an FIR was lodged against sub-inspectors Nitin Sharma and Mukesh Kumar and constables Dhananjay and Devendra in Bareilly district. The four cops had demanded Rs 7 lakh from a farmer and threatened to frame him in a drug case if he did not meet their demand. Vishal Singh, a constable in Lucknow, was arrested on December 8 for extorting several lakhs from a native of Kanpur. Police took serious note only after complaints reached senior officers.

Sources in the CM office said that he had gone to Kanpur earlier this week to review arrangements for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the city on Saturday, and gave directions to spruce up this wall next to the Sisamau drain. “On Thursday, when he returned there to review progress of Namami Gange, the wall had been repainted and a selfie point had been prepared. The CM inaugurated it by taking his photograph,” the official said. The 128-year-old Sisamau drain is significant as it is the largest drain falling into the Ganga. Under the Namamai Gange project, a government spokesperson said, 95% of the sewerage that had been falling into the Ganga in Kanpur was now being treated.

Lucknow,"Art ka kaam hai aaina dikhana, talwar le ke maarna nahi: Vishal Bhardwaj","The last day of the recently concluded literary festival was the most awaited when filmmaker, singer, composer Vishal Bhardwaj shared his thoughts with the audience. In conversation with Dr Surabhi Modi, who’s done her PhD on Vishal Bhardwaj and his films, the 'Haider', 'Pataakha' and 'Omkara' director and recipient of seven National Film Awards in various categories, touched upon several intriguing topics and offered some insights into the contextual relation between his works and Shakespeare’s plays. The director, who’s recreated some of the most famous works of Shakespeare, commented on the drivers that actually drove him to adapt the works of the Bard in the Indian context. He said, ""I realised that I cannot get the depth in plot lines and character study that Shakespeare manages to achieve. Hence, I thought of recreating his works in the Indian context because a good story line transcends caste, creed, nationality, etc."" Bhardwaj, who was born and educated in Meerut during his formative years, recalls how having seen a lot of gangsters in the city, was crucial to his adaptation of Omkara, a film based on Shakespeare’s Othello and shot in Lucknow too. Nana Patekar and Vishal Bhardwaj (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Nana Patekar and Vishal Bhardwaj (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Vishal also elaborated on the importance of the local dialect in a movie and the portrayal of characters, while criticizing Bollywood for sticking to ‘filmi’ language. Insisting that he wanted to tackle the social issues in India through the plot lines that Shakespeare had developed, the filmmaker touched upon the topic of Kashmir, which takes the centre piece in his Haider starring Shahid Kapoor. ""It is to very essential to bring the issues of the Kashmir valley into centre-stage,"" he said, adding, ""For an issue that is so historic, complicated and massive, it is vastly under represented in Indian cinema. Most of the work that has been done in this subject has been through an outsider’s perspective and hence I wanted to delve into a fresher perspective, the inner perspective of the valley; that’s why I set the story of Haider, based on Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the state."" Talking of his film Maqbool, which he adapted from Macbeth, Vishal explained the characters of Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah who play cops in the film. ""In the traditional manner the witches would have probably been shown as an aghori or such but mera aur mere co-writer dono ka yeh idea tha ki jo bhi log hain, woh hamare ird-gird ke hi log hain so we should make the witches people whom we encounter frequently and are an integral part of our society. So usmein sabse pehle yeh hi aaya ki cops make the best witches. Which they keep proving every day, as you all see. Iss tarah Om Puri aur Naseer sahab Maqbool ki witches bane."" Vishal Bhardwaj (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Vishal Bhardwaj (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) As the evening progressed, Vishal narrated some of his poetic works to the audience. He also expressed his nervousness to narrate in front of Nana Patekar (who was also present in the audience). In reference to his inclination towards poetry, he gave an anecdote from the sets of Haider. He went on to say, ""In Haider, there was a dialogue of two to three lines that was supposed to be recited by Irrfan. It was one of the poetic verses derived from Shakespeare’s Hamlet. However, Irrfan didn’t quite like the dialogue and couldn’t connect with it. So, at the moment, I decided to rewrite that whole poetic sequence. The sequence, I believe, turned out to be one of the strongest cuts of the movie."" After that, the house was open for questions. The audience raised some intriguing questions for the director. One audience member questioned him on his stylistic variation across his works and how he tends to reconcile those differences in the context of the breadth of his work. Vishal, quite reflectively and with brilliant poise, went on to say, “ Ek artist ka sabse bada darr hota hai ki usko kisi ek cage mein na qaid kar diya jaye ya ek category mein na daal diya jaye. I try to explore a lot of genres and make a conscientious effort to explore the varying subjects. That’s why main consciously try karta hoon ki meri har film ka subject alag ho.” Nana Patekar, at the point, in quite his charming and light-hearted manner took over the mike and casually asked Vishal, “Main kab kaam kar sakta hoon tumhare saath? Aur kitne saal mujhe wait karna padega yeh jaan ne ke liye ki main bhi thoda sa actor hoon? Zara soch ke jawaab dena, main bahut serious hoon.” An embarrassed and delighted Vishal was dumbstruck for a moment and then said, ""Ismein sochne wali koi baat hi nahi hai main aapka itna bada fan hoon, aur aapko yeh pata bhi hai lekin main usko abhi tak prove nahi kar paya hoon. I’m really looking forward to working with you Nana sahab, yeh meri galti hai ki abhi tak maine aapke saath kaam nahi kiya hai. But mujhe lagta hai ki aap gussa bhi bahot jaldi ho jaate hain toh kahin aisa na ho ki main koi role le ke aaoon aur aap naraaz ho jayein."" The final question from the audience pertained to art and its meaning and how art could influence society. Bhardwaj, in his usual witty manner, replied, ""Yeh kaam art ka nahi hain na, yeh kaam toh janta ka hi desh ko change karne ka. Agar aap ek aadmi ko laate jayenge jo desh ka bantadhaar kar raha hai toh usmein art kya karegi? Art ka kaam hai aaina dikhana, art ka kaam talwar le ke aake maarna nahi hai. It is not the job of art rather the job of the people to take the meaning out of art and evaluate their own choices. The job of art is to show a mirror to the society rather than attempt to make the decisions for the audience. That decision making is very much based on the fabric of the nation."" The discussion ended with Vishal’s rendition of his Dedh Ishqiya song Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji. — With inputs from Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,Licence requests of entrepreneurs to go online as DICs get makeover,"LUCKNOW: The mounting piles of applications from industrialists and entrepreneurs seeking licence or permit at the district industries centres (DIC) would be replaced with online requests. Replies to these requests will be instant, so that industrial activity in the state gets a push. The Yogi Adityanath government has decided to completely revamp and restructure the age-old district industries centres. Still existing in the infamous ‘licence permit raj’ era, DICs will be integrated into digital functioning of the state government. They will also be rechristened district industries promotion and entrepreneurship development centres (DIPEDC). The staff of the exisiting DICs would remain undisturbed and offices of the 75 DIPEDCs would be equipped with modern interiors and technology. A proposal in this regard was sent by MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh to the chief minister, who has approved it. MSME principal secretary Navneet Sehgal said with the restructuring of DICs, the one district, one product programme would get a boost. A majority of the applications and permits are sought by small- and medium-scale industries and entrepreneurs. Now, a businessman would not have to make rounds of the erstwhile DICs. They can apply online and expect instant response. The centres would also have an exclusive exhibition room where handicraft and industrial product of the particular district would be displayed. This way, the centres would play the role of nodal centres for the promotion of the product, schemes or subsidies the government offers. The staff, said Sehgal, which till now carried the outdated mindset of being an authority to grant sanctions would also see a shift in approach. From an ‘inspector’ who gives permission, they would become means of support to assist industry. With a commitment of Rs 4.28 lakh crore in investment from big corporate houses and e-governance being the focus of the government, it was time to address the needs of investors, said Sehgal. "
Lucknow,Sitapur to get UP’s 1st adolescent health clinic,"LUCKNOW: Questions and worries are part of adolescent life. In the absence of confidants and counsellors, most teenagers find it difficult to deal with the plethora of changes that the body and mind undergo with puberty. To bridge the glaring gap in communication, the state government has come up with a safe space concept for adolescents and young adults (10 to 19 years). The first adolescent-friendly health clinic (AFHC), aptly called Saathiya, will be launched on December 18 at Sitapur’s Mishrik block by health minister Jai Pratap Singh and the pilot project will be replicated in other districts soon. Being set up under National Health Mission (NHM) with support from Population Foundation of India (PFI), the project is also aimed at bringing down the high rate of teenage pregnancies in UP. It is being covered under the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram. According to extrapolated data from National Family Health Survey (NHFS-4) and the 2011 Census, India is estimated to have around 44.67 lakh teenage pregnancies a year. Of these, over 4 lakh cases are from UP alone with Sitapur featuring among the top five districts with maximum teenage pregnancies in the state. “It has been observed that adolescent girls in rural areas find it harder to open up about changes that happen with puberty and about their health problems. It is not easy for a rural adolescent to approach a doctor or hospital with queries,” said minister Singh. “This is where a dedicated clinic and information centre comes into play. Young boys and girls will find peer educators who can help them confront adolescent issues. With its friendly ‘club meetings’, the clinic will be a safe space for them,” he maintained. Groundwork for nine months in Sitapur has revealed that there has been a 36% increase in counselling sought by adolescents between April and September 2019. “Around 52,000 adolescents were approached in schools and close to 2,500 peer educators have already been trained,” Singh said. The minister added that once adolescents were educated about safe sex, masturbation and honouring each other’s bodies, it would help deal with rapes, sexual crimes and teenage pregnancies. Data shows 25% of UP’s population is between 10 to 19 years of age. Majority of these youngsters are from 57 districts of the state, of which 25 districts are categorised as high priority with maximum number of adolescents in the said age group based there. Sitapur is one of them. "
Kanpur,PM Narendra Modi to chair maiden Ganga Council meet in Kanpur today,"LUCKNOW: Kanpur is all set to host the maiden meet of National Ganga Council on Saturday, which will be chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with senior Cabinet ministers in tow, including finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and environment minister Prakash Javadekar. Only chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand will attend while three other CMs of Gangetic states — Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal — expressed inability to participate. On the eve of PM Modi’s high-profile visit to Kanpur, Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat emphasised that Uttar Pradesh would have to play a bigger and focused role to regain the glory of Ganga. In an exclusive conversation with TOI after reaching Kanpur on Friday, he said, “This is the first time, the Centre released Rs 15,000 crore to five states for afforestation and vegetation along Ganga’s catchment areas to ensure adequate availability of water and uninterrupted flow.” Singh, who is overseeing preparations for the first meet of the Ganga Council, said since the prime minister undertook the mission to cleanse the river through the Namami Gange project, much has been achieved. The Union Jal Shakti minister said since Ganga passed through Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, these states cannot escape responsibility and accountability and the Centre was providing sufficient funds and support. “Earlier water quality tests would be performed manually at 38 sampling points and it took much time to get the report. Now, 40 more sampling points have been identified for real-time monitoring,” he said. As per the schedule, PM’s aircraft will land at Chakeri airport at 10.25am from where he would reach Chandrashekhar Azad University by a chopper to attend the Ganga Council meeting at 10.50am, which will continue till 12.50pm.

Lucknow,High court paves way for Lucknow University Students’ Union election,"LUCKNOW: On the centenary year of Lucknow University, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC on Friday paved way for students’ union polls on the campus after 15 years, dismissing a 2012 petition which stayed the elections. The last students’ union election was held in September 2005 followed by a tumultuous phase before the high court stay order was enforced on October 3, 2012. The court also allowed withdrawal of three writ petitions through which some students sought holding elections for the academic sessions 2016-17 and 2017-18. Passing the order, a bench of Justices M N Bhandari and V K Srivastava granted liberty to the petitioners to move court, seeking student union polls for the current academic session or next session. On October 3, 2012, hearing a petition filed by student Hemant Singh, the court passed an interim order staying the poll scheduled on October 15 the same year. The petitioner had questioned the age cap by LU on the date of nomination, instead of the beginning of academic session. The court also found that the state government had not categorized LU as recommended by the Lyngdoh Committee report. "
Kanpur,Safety first: Fleet rehearsal of boats held,"Kanpur: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the city on Saturday, a fleet rehearsal of boats was conducted on the Ganga to check the security and other arrangements. Modi would take a boat ride on the river from Atal Ghat to witness the work done under his government’s ambitious Namami Gange programme. Tight security arrangements have been made.

From here, PM would ride a steamer and witness the Sisamau nullah, which once used to pollute the Ganga. Authorities have made proper arrangement for PM’s Ganga voyage with a big steamer being arranged for him. Officials said if it rains, the PM would then travel on a glass-packed boat, otherwise he is likely to ride an open boat. When the boat rehearsal was conducted, a yellow boat bus led the other boats. SPG men, NDRF, divers and policemen were seated on steamers and small boats. Heavy police force remained deployed on the ghat and on floating jetty. To ensure full-proof security, CCTV and other high-end cameras would keep an eye. These cameras have been installed at Atal Ghat, CSA University and other at vital locations. "

Lucknow,"Lucknow University students wary of revival of elections, fear lawlessness","LUCKNOW: If all goes well, Lucknow University Students’ Union (LUSU) elections may be held next year in August-September after a gap of 15 years. The HC order has come at LU's centenary year. Interestingly, students’ union itself is 99 years old and if elections are held in next session, it will coincide with LUSU's 100th year. TimesViewUniversity students’ unions are a cradle of democracy where students learn about different ideologies and functions of a constitutional democracy. However, blatant interference of politicians and mafia from the late 80s till 2005 led to criminalisation of student politics. Student leaders started using the union as a source of muscle power to grab government construction contracts and as a launching pad for their political career rather than using it as a platform to raise the problems of students. As stakes were high, violence and indiscipline became a daily affair, forcing authorities to discontinue union elections in 2006. Now, when the path is open to revive the union, LU as well as the state government will have to ensure that it is used for the purpose it was constituted for.“We will decide the course of action after receiving a copy of the high court order,” said additional director of LU’s public relations cell Rahul Pandey in an official statement of the university. While officiating vice-chancellor SK Shukla did not responded to calls, other LU officials pleading anonymity said that the university had given in writing to the state government last year that it was ready for elections, provided it got to choose from the formats suggested by the Supreme Court and proper police force for security. The news, however, led to cheers among student leaders who celebrated on the campus by distributing sweets. Incidents of indiscipline were also visible, with many barging inside the compound at night, zooming around tripling on bikes and raising slogans. Common students, on the other hand, responded cautiously. Rudranshu Singh, a law student, said that the revival of union might help in raising problems of students but authorities would have to ensure that no criminal elements are allowed and political parties are kept at bay. MA student Sukurti Shukla said, “I have heard that when students’ union was active, violence and lawlessness was the order of the day. Girls were harassed and teachers were bullied, vitiating the academic atmosphere and resulting in a drop in LU’s rating. I will support for revival only when the administration will ensure our safety.” LUSU has produced many political stalwarts, including former President of India Shakar Dayal Sharma. In the 99-year-old history of the students’ union, elections were held on ideological basis till the 70s, before political parties started interfering in them. The gradual decline saw the entry of student leaders with criminal record supported by mafia in the late 80s and 90s. Violence became an integral part of union politics between late 90s and 2005. In fact, in 2004-2005, in a year, the university witnessed over 100 incidents of violence involving student leaders in which two students were also shot dead. The union elections were last held in 2005 in which Bajrangi Singh Bajju was elected president. In 2006, elections were cancelled following large-scale violence after implementation of the Supreme Court order based on the Lyngdoh Commission report which recommended an age bar of 25 years and restriction on candidates with criminal record or indiscipline from contesting elections. Elections were not held till 2011 due to law and order issues. In 2012, LU announced elections, but they were stayed by the high court on the petition of a student leader who was disqualified due to age bar. "
Lucknow,Onion effect: Biryani brands mull price hike,"LUCKNOW: A date with your favourite nawabi dish in the city may no longer be easy on the pocket. To buffer the burgeoning rate of onion, which touched an all-time high of Rs 140/kg last week, historical food brands such as Tunday Kababi, Idrees Biryani, Wahid Biryani and Mubeen’s are considering a hike in menu prices because reducing portions alone isn’t helping matters much. According to eatery owners, onions make up one-sixth of any non-vegetarian recipe such as kebab, biryani, nihari and korma. In the past five months, the price of onion has increased three times and as a result, the cost of production has gone up by 25-30%. For instance, one plate of chicken curry requires 200gm of onion and is also served with raw onion rings. Till August, when the price of onion was around Rs 50/kg, the cost of production for a plate of chicken curry was around Rs 53 and the price on the menu after adding 25% profit was Rs 70. Once the price of onion breached Rs 100/kg, the cost of production escalated to Rs 65 per plate, leaving a profit margin of only Rs 5. Eatery owners said they first tried to accommodate the current price of onion by reducing its quantity in the salad. Next, they replaced salad onions with radish and carrots. But now, the crisis has become too hot to handle and revising menu prices seems the only viable option. “Had the onion crisis spanned 2-3 months, we may have managed with less profits. But, it has been deepening for six months with no relief in sight. We have to increase menu prices to sustain business,” said Shoaib of Idrees Biryani. Mohammad Usman of Tunday Kababi at Chowk couldn’t agree more. “Our aim has always been to offer every customer a sumptuous meal at Rs 70. When the price of onion doubled, we tried to make do by reducing quantity per plate. If onion tears continue, the only choice left will be to increase menu prices so that quality is not compromised,” he said. Manager of Wahid Restaurant Abdul Wahab said they had stopped packing onion with the tangy green chutney for takeaways to buffer the price blow. “However, in-house guests are still served onion salad. We need new pricing strategy to keep our business going,” he added. Mubeen’s has started using a special variety of apple, which is not sweet, in place of onion in gravy. “However, it is not a long-term solution. Nothing tastes as good as onions in a non-veg curry. An increase in menu price is inevitable,” said Shoeb, manager of the restaurant. "
Lucknow,"Exclusively for boys, Colvin college to become co-education on 130th birthday","LUCKNOW: A school exclusively meant for boys since its inception in 1889, the historical Colvin Taluqdars’ College will celebrate its 130th anniversary by opening its gates to girls. Run by British India Association, an outfit comprising erstwhile rajas and taluqdars of Awadh, the institution has produced many a stalwart in more than a century — from politicians, army generals, bureaucrats and corporate executives to sportspersons, academics, artists, poets and scientists. “We have decided to introduce co-education classes from primary to Class X in the next academic session, beginning April 2020. Girls will be able to take admission in Class XI from 2021. The decision has been taken following a trend across the country. Several historical boys’ and girls’ colleges have now become co-educational. It also gels with the national motto to empower women,” college manager Manish Vardhan Singh told newspersons on Friday. Named after Sir Auckland Colvin, the lieutenant-governor of Agra and Awadh, the school in 1889 was exclusively for sons of Awadh landlords until it was thrown open to boys from all sections of the society in 1933. The institution celebrates its Darbar Day (annual function and sports meet) every year on December 23 with much fanfare. It boasts both day schooling and boarding facilities while there are two wings — one affiliated to UP Board and another to CISCE. Principal Anoop Raj said the 130th anniversary celebrations would include a talent hunt, Udaan-e-Anjuman, on December 15. Students from various schools and colleges have been invited and the event will also be open to the general public. Old Boys’ Week will start on December 18 and culminate on Darbar Day, he added. Old timers said that the Colvin college was rated among top educational institutions in the country till the late 90s. Its students figured among top 10 on the merit list of UP Board. However, quality of education declined amid teacher politics and management dispute before the cradle saw a wave of revival in 2005. Since then, it has improved both in terms of academic ambience and infrastructure, they added. "
Lucknow,Suffer bad roads as Lucknow Municipal Corporation cites cold to halt repair,"LUCKNOW: For next 45 days, city residents will have no option but to continue to risk their life and limb by commuting on potholed roads as Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) has stopped all road repair work citing weather conditions. Though the weather is expected to be clear by Sunday after rain and waterlogged roads gave a tough time to people on Friday, commuting would remain difficult as foggy conditions would prevail in days to come. TimesViewThe LMC had made an excuse during the summer months of April, May and June that high temperatures are not conducive for road repair and construction. During the monsoon months, it cited damp atmosphere due to rains as not feasible for the job. Now, during winters, the civic body has suspended the work due to low temperatures. This leaves February-March and October-November for construction and repair of roads. The question is, when officers are aware of the limitations posed by weather, why are they not planning accordingly to finish the work when the conditions are favourable. It is the people who are forced to bear the brunt of bad roads despite paying taxes. The dust blowing from these damaged roads is also the main source of air pollution in the city.According to LMC officials, roads constructed or repaired during present weather condition would not be durable. Chief engineer, LMC, Manish Kumar said: “Temperature is low these days and drops below 15 degrees Celsius during night. In such conditions, bitumen used for construction and repair of roads does not settle properly. As a result, the quality of roads is not good.” He said weather be conducive for work by January-end. According to LMC records, 269 roads covering a stretch of about 174km in the city need to be repaired. In a reality check on Friday, TOI found roads in many areas including Jankipuram, Mahanagar, Aliganj, Niralanagar, Indiranagar, Nishatganj, Chinhat, Gomtinagar, Nakkhas and Narahi in a bad shape. In some areas, the upper layer of roads had worn away and loose concrete made two-wheelers skid, in other localities big craters posed a major threat to drivers. People claimed that conditions would worsen when visibility level would drop between 0-50 metres due to fog. Sunil Srivastava of Mahanagar said he and his 10-year-old daughter suffered injuries after his scooter skid on a rough patch on the road connecting Mandir Marg with H road on Friday afternoon. “I was coming home after picking my daughter from school and could not see a bad stretch on the road due to puddles created by rain and lost balance,” he said. Ajay, a resident of Nishatganj market, said: “Three women have slipped on loose concrete and bruised themselves since morning. The condition of roads is so poor that commuters lose control on their vehicles and often get injured while trying to dodge potholes.” The stretch between Naka Hindola intersection and Basmandi market is riddled with potholes and stones can be seen scattered all along the route. The road has also become narrow due to barricading done by the Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation (UPSBC) for construction of a flyover in the area leading to several accidents and heavy traffic jams. Rinku Chaurasiya, a resident of the area, said; “Four people have sustained injuries in this stretch due to potholes and slippery roads.” (With inputs from Akshata Mishra)"
Lucknow,"Shia PG College to mark its centenary with Quran recitation, cricket tourneys","LUCKNOW: A 100 years ago, when the first few students who enrolled in Shia College, then a school, entered the premises with their slates in hand, the Bada (Asafi) Imambara doubled as their classroom. From that temporary arrangement in 1919 to a full-fledged postgraduate degree institution now, Shia PG College has seen a century of glory. As a tribute to the legacy, the college is observing centenary celebrations starting Friday till February 2020. “The first event on Saturday will be a Qirat (recitation of the Quran) competition between students of various madrassas and students from our college itself. On Sunday, we will inaugurate the three day Khateeb-e-Akbar Maulana Mirza Mohammad Athar inter collegiate cricket tournament. It will be attended by former Indian cricket team wicketkeeper SMH Kirmani,” said organising committee member MM Abu Tayyab. A youth festival, Expression, in January 2020 will see 17 events including debate, qawwali, photography, film review, street play and others. In the same month, a mushaira with poets such as Munawwar Rana, Rahat Indori, Betab Hallauri and Manzar Bhopali will be held. A Dastangoi event will follow. The celebrations will culminate on February 15. The seeds for starting a degree college in Lucknow were sown in 1915 when prominent members of the Shia community including clerics and royalty mooted the idea. This was followed by a Shia delegation meeting the lieutenant governor of then-United Provinces, seeking establishment of the college. However, the plan could not materialize due to restrictions imposed by the then-government in view of the proposed residential university in Lucknow with Canning College as its nucleus. From a school with temporary arrangement of classes at Bada Imambara, Shia College then rose to the status of intermediate college in 1922, teaching humanities and social sciences. The foundation of the main campus on Sitapur Road was laid on the land provided by the Karbala of King Nasiruddin Haider of Awadh. Classes were shifted to this building in 1923 and it rose to being a degree college in 1995. "
Lucknow,‘Lucknow University law fifth semester exams not cancelled’,"LUCKNOW: Officiating vice-chancellor of Lucknow University SK Shukla on Friday clarified that none of the LLB fifth semester exams had been cancelled and stressed that there was no proposal to cancel them either. The university is rescheduling exams and centres, the roster for which will be made available between December 14 and 15. The clarification came after a group of LLB students gathered outside the VC’s camp office to demand answers following confusion over the status of their exams. On Thursday, a fifth semester paper was stalled as student unrest over alleged third semester paper leak rocked the varsity’s twin campuses. “Students should not believe in rumours. Any difficulty that may have come up (during conduct of an exam) will be taken care of by the controller of examination. A new scheme (exam timetable) will be put up with fresh venues,” Shukla said.

Lucknow,Contribute one brick &amp; Rs 11 for Ram temple: Yogi Adityanath,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday urged every household in Jharkhand to contribute at least one brick and Rs 11 for construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, while addressing an election rally in Bagodar, which votes on Monday. The chief minister’s call comes a month after Supreme Court ruled in favour of construction of a temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site. He said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was responsible for ushering in Ram Rajya. “In one sweep, the PM removed Article 370 in Kashmir. Today, you can go to Kashmir, Ladakh, Jammu, to the land of Ma Vaishno and Baba Amarnath and buy land. If someone has given you that right, it is PM Modi,” he said. He said after abrogation of Article 370, there was no loss of life, despite fear-mongering by Congress, RJD, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and CPI(ML). Commenting on the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, Yogi said India has never been biased towards anyone on the basis of caste or community, but the situation is the opposite in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. “Minorities in these countries were thrashed and thrown out, their women exploited, their properties looted. They came to India looking for refuge and the government has granted them citizenship,” he said, adding opposition parties who were opposing this bill were speaking the language of Pakistan.

The arrested men were identified as Ishant Agarwal and Manoj Goyal. Director general (EOW) Rajendra Pal Singh said the duo were summoned to the EOW office where they were arrested when they gave contradictory statements and could not provide documentary evidence to prove their innocence.

Lucknow,"Ayodhya railway station to don new look, to be modelled on Ram temple","LUCKNOW: It will be a unique experience for train travellers in Ayodhya as the city’s railway station is all set to get a new look. To be ready by October 2020, the structure will replicate a temple, giving passengers a feel of the temple town. The makeover and expansion of the railway station were initially proposed in 2018 but could not go forward due to the long-pending Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case. However, after the Supreme Court’s verdict on November 9 paving way for a Ram temple, the redevelopment plan of Ayodhya railway station into a world-class station is back on track, among other plans for the city. The grand railway station will have pillars and domes as in a temple. Apart from infrastructure upgrade, passenger amenities and services will also be added. Two 6-metrewide foot overbridges will connect the three platforms for ease of passengers. The station will reflect the culture and essence of the temple town, while the walls of the station will be adorned with bricks replicating the ‘shilas’ to be used in the foundation of the Ram temple with ‘Sri Ram’ inscribed on them. Rs 80 crore for makeover of Ayodhya railway stationA document of Northern Railway, Lucknow division regarding the station makeover stated that the redevelopment of the station, “which is of religious and cultural importance”, will be done on turnkey basis. Senior divisional commercial manager (NR) Lucknow Jagtosh Shukla said, “With an investment of Rs 80 crore, the railway station will be beautified along the lines of a temple. Rail India Technical and Economic Service has been asked to work on the project, which is already under way.” The new station will be lit up with LED lights. It will have 24 mineral water kiosks at its three platforms, around 150 steel benches for passengers, air-conditioned waiting rooms and deluxe and modern executive lounges, along with accommodation for railway officials.

Ghaziabad,"Only 3 of 17 promises met, councillors remind Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation","GHAZIABAD : During an executive committee meeting of the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation held on Friday, councillors alleged that out of the 17 promises made by the civic body at the start of the fiscal year just three have been fulfilled. The councillors alleged that the biometric system for sanitation workers and staff deployed at parks to mark their attendance has not been implemented yet and they are being given salaries without verification. They claimed that in absence of proper checks, sanitation workers are not turning up for work regularly. Rajiv Sharma, a councillor, said: “There are 3,800 sanitation workers in the city and if they do their duty every day, the city will look a lot cleaner. A similar situation prevails at parks that are not being maintained properly.” GMC commissioner Dinesh Chandra, consequently, formed a three-member panel under additional municipal commissioner Pramod Kumar to investigate the allegations and submit a report by Monday. Chandra ordered to make biometric attendance of sanitation workers compulsory within a week’s time. Raising the issue of stray dogs, cattle and monkeys, councillors demanded that barricades should be put in border areas so that civic agencies from neighbouring cities do not dump animals caught by them in Ghaziabad. At present, there is just one organization, People for Animal, which is carrying out a sterilisation drive in Ghaziabad. Mayor Asha Sharma directed the veterinary officer to prepare a proposal to hire individual firms for this work for each zone of the city. To deal with the monkey menace, a ‘monkey park’ was proposed to be developed in a two-acre plot of land near Rajnagar Extension by the civic body in its “resolution document” at the start of the fiscal year. The commissioner said the proposal would be looked into after discussing it with the forest department.  The executive committee had also proposed to open gyms in 25 parks of the city besides upgrading the facilities at its primary schools, parks and the library at Company Bagh. A revised budget of the civic body was also presented before the committee. Under eight earning heads including rent, revenue, licence fee, GMC had hoped to raise over Rs 689 crore in the 2019-20 fiscal year, but so far it has managed to raise only Rs 278 crore. Interestingly, for the remaining part of this fiscal, the target has been raised to Rs 719 crore. GMC had proposed an expenditure of Rs 908 crore in the current fiscal year but has been able to spend only Rs 312 crore. Despite this, for the remaining fiscal it has proposed to spend Rs 951 crore.

Kanpur,Focus on Arth Ganga model: PM Modi to 5 states,"KANPUR: PM Narendra Modi directed governments of five Gangetic states — UP, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and West Bengal — to focus on promoting religious and adventure tourism on the river to generate sustainable income to clean the Ganga. The focus should shift from Namami Gange to Arth Ganga, which would prop up a sustainable development model through economic activity, he said. Chairing the first meeting of the National Ganga Council in Kanpur on Saturday, the PM said a digital dashboard should be set up for collating data on water quality from villages and urban bodies and this can be monitored by Niti Aayog and Jal Shakti ministry. He said districts bordering the Ganga should be monitored as ‘focus areas’ under Namami Gange. The meeting was attended by Union ministers for jal shakti, environment, agriculture and rural development, health, urban affairs, power, tourism and shipping. Also, chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, deputy chief minister of Bihar, vice-chairman of Niti Aayog and other senior officials participated in the meet. West Bengal, whose chief minister has been at loggerheads with the Centre on various issues, remained unrepresented, as was Jharkhand where assembly elections are taking place. Kanpur, which is the biggest polluter of the Ganga, recently diverted sewage from the 128-year-old Sisamau drain to a sewage treatment plant. Officials said the venue for the meeting, Kanpur, was significant in acknowledging that 95% of 13.6crore litre of sewage offloaded into the river from the drain was now being treated. The PM also took a boat ride from Atal Ghat to the Sisamau Drain after the meeting. Saturday’s meeting focused on turning the ‘Clean Ganga’ mission into an example of cooperative federalism with all departments and central ministries adopting a Ganga-centric approach. In a presentation to the PM on the progress of the Namami Gange project, it was stated that the Centre committed Rs 20,000 crore towards cleaning the river in five states between 2015 and 2020. Of this, Rs 7,700 crore has been spent, particularly for the construction of new sewage treatment plants. Focussing on the concept of ‘Arth Ganga’, the PM said, economic activity around the river would include encouraging farmers to engage in sustainable agriculture practices like zero budget farming, planting of fruit trees and setting up nurseries on the banks. To supplement this, he said, activities like water sports, camping, cycling or walking should be encouraged along the river to tap into the hybrid tourism potential of the river basin area. The income generated from eco-tourism, Ganga wildlife conservation and cruise tourism would help generate sustainable income streams for cleaning the Ganga, PM Modi said. "
Lucknow,Rape victim’s father reminded me of dad: Priyanka Gandhi,"LUCKNOW: Referring to a rape and murder victim as UP’s “unfortunate daughter”, Congress national general secretary and UP in charge Priyanka Gandhi said that the plight of the father of the woman reminded her of her own father Rajiv Gandhi. “His gesture, pain and love for his daughter reminded me of my father whose mutilated body I had brought home at the age of 19,” said Priyanka. She was speaking at the Congress party’s Bharat Bachao rally in New Delhi on Saturday. “A few days ago, I went to meet a farmer in the Awadh region. He was almost the age of my father. He had struggled all his life to make ends meet. His son left to work in another state while he married off three of his five daughters. One of his daughters was raped by the local pradhan’s son. Police refused to lodge an FIR but the girl travelled to the neighbouring district to pursue her case,” Priyanka said. Back home, she added, the accused bashed the farmer up and burned the family crop. One morning, the accused set the complainant on fire, Priyanka said. “I was listening to their plight when the aggrieved father began weeping. I felt his pain...my father’s blood and his daughter’s blood has mingled with the pious soil of India, which is going through a tough time. It is the duty of each one of us to stand up against all the wrongs happening around us,” said the Congress leader. In India now, injustice had become the order of the day. Crimes against women have peaked. Culprits are saved while aggrieved women are not. The interest of the poor and needy is overlooked while that of the rich businessmen is safeguarded,” she said.

Lucknow,"Vice-chancellor, law professors at daggers drawn over Lucknow University paper leak","LUCKNOW: The battle lines were drawn on Saturday between Lucknow University’s officiating vice-chancellor SK Shukla and law teachers, led by their dean professor CP Singh, with one holding the other responsible for the LLB third semester paper leak. Law teachers accused Shukla of requesting them to “help” the female student and alleged beneficiary of the leak, and of suspending two colleagues without an inquiry. The VC retaliated by saying that the teachers were working under pressure from a publisher of a popular model question paper series for law. The LLB third semester examinations were cancelled on December 11 and two teachers suspended after six audio clips went viral in which male voices are heard dictating questions expected in the examination to a woman, said to be an examinee and manager of a private medical college. In one of the clips, she also names the VC. After the scandal broke out, an FIR was lodged and an internal committee formed to probe the matter. Addressing a news conference on Saturday, dean Singh said: “As far as I remember, it was October 12 when Shukla, then LU registrar, called and sought an appointment. I asked him to tell me over phone what he wanted us to do, but he said that at times a man has to ‘make an effort’ for important persons. Later, he came to my office along with a woman, introduced her as an LLB semester III student in a private college. He sat for over an hour and had two cups of tea before requesting us to ‘help’ her.” Professor Singh explained that “such help” was often sought for admissions or examinations. However, he added, teachers usually tell students about topics they need to study, but never leak questions. “Actions like suspension and lodging an FIR are agreeable only after an offence is established through a preliminary inquiry,” he said and denied that the voices heard in the audio clips were of the accused teachers. The VC, when contacted, did not deny that he had introduced the student to law teachers. “A man can arrange a meeting of a person with another, but if the two persons later commit a crime, how is the man responsible for it? At the press meet, the teachers have however admitted that I mounted no pressure on them,” he said and called the news conference illegal because it was convened without his permission. Giving TOI copies of question papers and model papers, Shukla said their probe had revealed that 80% content of the question papers matched those published in a model paper. “Now that raises doubts that the accused teachers were under pressure from the said publisher.” On allegations of arbitrary action, the VC said: “Paper leak is as heinous a crime as murder or rape. Nowhere does the law call for a probe before lodging an FIR. I took action because LU’s image was at stake.” "
Ghaziabad,No more mobile pujas &amp; cricket: Data price pinches poor as much as onions,"For her daily evening puja, Ghaziabad resident Reena Peshawar plays an online aarti. But now she’s debating whether she should cut back on some of that devotion or the makeup videos she watches since her monthly mobile prepaid plan has jumped from Rs 169 to Rs 249. “I just bought a new cellphone with my Diwali bonus and already I have to cut back,” says the 22-year-old domestic worker who earns Rs 6,000 a month. With Airtel, Vodafone and Jio increasing tariffs for prepaid plans, the urban poor, who get their fix of what digital anthropologist Payal Kapoor calls ABCD: Astrology, Bollywood, Cricket and Devotion, from their smartphones, are feeling the pinch. And the numbers of those affected aren’t small since prepaid accounts for 95% of Indian subscribers. Kiran Adhar, an East Delhi housewife, loves uploading videos of her toddler and lip-syncing to Bollywood songs. But the recent hike has dampened her enthusiasm. Adhar used to get her phone recharged for Rs 500 for 84 days which got her 2GB data. Now, for the same amount of data she would have to pay Rs 200 more. Airtel, Vodafone-Idea brings new plans with unlimited calls: Price, data benefits and moreRabita, a domestic worker, had started with an unlimited call and data plan and graduated to expenses of Rs 50 per month. This has shot up to Rs 98. “Earlier I could buy a couple of onions for Rs 10-Rs 15 in a week when we were making some non-vegetarian food at home but now I can’t even buy one onion for that amount. I can live without onions in my kitchen but not without my data plan,” she says. For security guards who have night duty or cabbies who have to wait between rides, the mobile is a much-needed source of entertainment. Urban poor to cut down on cellphone useKumar, a driver, watches Tamil films in between rides. “I can’t give up the phone. If my regular customers can’t call me, or I can’t check GPS, my work suffers. But I will have to cut down on whatever is unnecessary,” he said. He plans to restrict his wife’s phone now to a basic plan that allows only incoming calls. This has also increased from Rs 35 to Rs 49. But he knows there is no explaining this to his six-year-old daughter who has to get her daily fix of cartoons before going to bed. Migrant workers like M K Singh, a watchman, are having second thoughts about the long video calls they make to family members. “My family is back in UP’s Badaun. I used to make video calls to my parents in the village but I will have to be careful about my spending now. Rs 100 a month is a very large increase in expense that I can’t afford,” he says. Ranjit Mishra, who owns a shop in Mayur Vihar that charges mobiles, says most customers were unhappy. “People come and fight with me when I tell them the increased rates. Even a new connection costs more. Earlier you could get a SIM for Rs 495 but it is now available for Rs 647,” he adds. "

Police said the brothers had recorded the act and also threatened the 17-year-old girl saying they would post the video online. The survivor’s brother told TOI that she is a Class XII student in a private school of Ghaziabad. Himanshu studies in Class X, after failing in class twice and Akash failed his Class VIII exams. “Three years ago, a 14-year-old girl, who lives in our neighbourhood, took my sister to her home on the pretext of having tea. After consuming the tea, my sister fell unconscious and the youths raped her and recorded a video of the act,” said the brother. “Few days ago, Akash and Himanshu had an argument with my younger brother and threatened to upload the video on social media platforms. At that time, my brother did not understand what had happened. But on Wednesday, when a boy who is a friend of my brother and Akashvisited our house and told us about a video where the youths were seen raping my sister, I inquired with her. She said the two had raped her at several places over the past three years due to which she had also missed several classes,” he added. Following a preliminary investigation, the three were booked on Friday under IPC sections 376 D (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation), and sections 3 and 4 of POCSO Act. “We are trying to track down Akash and we are investigating the role of the 14-year-old girl,” said SP (rural), Neeraj Kumar Jadaun.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad to start drive against drug sale, use","GHAZIABAD: Following complaints of drugs being sold openly in many parts of the city, the district administration has launched a campaign to tackle the menace and directed police to initiate action against peddlers. A committee under additional district magistrate (city) Shailendra Kumar Singh has been formed. It will meet every fortnight and review the progress made in this direction. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey has sent a letter to all SHOs of the district, directing them to identify drug peddlers under their respective jurisdiction and take action against them. The police officers will also have to send a weekly report on whether anyone in their areas are selling drugs. If any such case comes to notice during a surprise inspection, action will be taken against the SHO concerned, the DM said. The matter will also be a part of the periodical meeting on law and order and the monthly review meeting. The DM has directed officials to identify children, youth and elderly who are addicted to drugs and staying on streets. The officials have been asked to make arrangements for their treatment. The DM instructed the social welfare officer to write a letter to the government to set up a shelter home for them. In addition to this, NGOs would be requested to provide assistance in setting up shelter homes. The social welfare officer has also been tasked with forming a ‘Sankalp’ group of children and youths who are fully cured of addiction, and parents who have helped their children in their struggle. This group will provide counselling to people and their families who are dealing with the issue of drug addiction. Moreover, officials of the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC) has been directed to ensure that medicines are given to patients at de-addiction centres only in the presence of doctors. No prescription should be given to them, the administration has said. The DM said that in many cases, it has come to the notice that after receiving medicines, patients go back and sell these pills in the market. The NDDTC has been asked not to let such people go out of the de-addiction centre till they are being treated, and not to prescribe the medicine for the six-month course, he added. Besides, drug inspectors would also carry out checks at pharmacy stores to ensure that psychiatric medicines are not sold over the counters. They will contact the manufacturers of such medicines and collate information about who have been sold stocks. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad Development Authority starts using sewage treatment plant water in park,"GHAZIABAD: In an attempt to conserve groundwater, Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has started using treated water from its sewage treatment plant (STP) at Indirapuram for horticulture. The authority has laid a 2.6-km-long pipeline from its Indirapuram STP till Swarn Jayanti Park in the township for the purpose. GDA plans to use treated water in over 50 major parks in the township. “In September, the GDA board had made it mandatory for highrises to lay pipelines for kitchen water and sewer water for use in horticulture. We are planning to use treated water from the Indirapuram STP to water the green belts and the central verge of roads. We have started using it to water Swarn Jayanti Park,” said V N Singh, the chief engineer, GDA. “We have over 120 parks under our jurisdiction, out of which 50 are in Indirapuram. We will lay separate pipelines to each park and treated water will be directly channelised to them,” Singh added. Environmentalists welcomed the move. “GDA and GMC have been illegally extracting groundwater through borewells installed in its nurseries, green belts and parks for horticulture in contravention of various directions and guidelines of the Central Ground Water Authority,” said Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist. “We had filed petitions in the NGT seeking an end to the practice. Were relived that the Authority is finally acting on it.” "
Lucknow,"Lucknow University students vote aye for union of ideals, nay for ‘goonda’ league","LUCKNOW: “If the authorities develop a JNU-like model for a union where students fight it out with ideologies and not guns, I am all for it. But, if revival means return to pre-2007 goondagardi, then it is a big no,” MA student Swati Shukla was overheard telling her classmates Sahil Mahajan and Warisha Siddiqui outside Tagore Library at LU. While Sahil contended that a union would ensure the student voice is heard, Warisha was opposed to the idea and cited how the academic ambience had been vitiated in the past. “Harassment of girls was rampant. Student leaders worked for political parties and were more interested in furthering their political career. They hardly cared what students wanted,” she said. While Sahil contended that a union would ensure the student voice is heard, Warisha was opposed to the idea and cited how the academic ambience had been vitiated in the pastSahil had a prompt reply. “Look around you. There are no proper drinking water kiosks on the campus or toilets for that matter. Hostels are in a mess. Members of staff are rude when we apply for academic documents. A students’ union is imperative to fix all this,” he argued. The debate raged on at the arts quadrangle. When his BA classmates pointed out how student leaders had beaten up teachers last year, a combative Kartikey Singh Tomar retorted, “Agreed that there will be a bit of violence now and then, but a union alone can train future leaders of politics; something you don’t learn in classrooms.” Outside the cashier’s office, hosteller Ramji Tripathi was overheard saying a union would help students influence LU decisions. “Be it fee hike or facilities in hostels, classrooms and libraries, we don’t have a say in anything as of now,” he maintained. Tripathi’s batchmates disagreed. “If the varsity makes headlines for violence, we will not get admission or employment anywhere in the country,” one of them said. While most girls seemed to be against a union owing to the history of harassment associated with student leaders, some supported the cause and were even keen to contest polls. “Once women enter student politics and vote in large numbers, men (male student leaders) will have to respect them and that will end harassment by their aides,” said Ayesha Sharma of the BCom department.

Kanpur,"Man ‘poisons’ girl before rape, attempts suicide","Kanpur: A 25-year-old man allegedly poisoned a 17-year-old girl before sexually assaulting her and then himself consumed the poison in a village under Akbarpur Kotwali police station in Kanpur Dehat district on Saturday. The incident, which had taken place on Saturday morning, came to light after the girl’s father lodged an FIR in this regard the same evening. The condition of both--the girl and the man--who are admitted in different hospitals, is stated to be stable. The girl’s father in his complaint alleged that Yogendra had raped his minor daughter at gunpoint while she had gone to attend nature’s call in the fields in the village outskirts on Saturday morning. “After committing the rape, he allegedly poisoned the girl and later, he himself consumed the poison,” the police said. “Meanwhile, some locals saw the girl and Yogendra with froth coming out of their mouths. They immediately sounded the police who took them to the district hospital. After a few hours, the doctors referred the man to Kanpur after his condition deteriorated,” said inspector Akbarpur Kotwali Amod Kumar. The preliminary investigation has revealed that the duo was in a relationship for a long time. However, their families were not in favour of their relationship, and the investigations to corroborate the same is underway. “On the complaint of the girl’s father, an FIR under relevant sections of the IPC, including 376 (rape), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison etc with the intention to commit an offence) and the POCSO Act has been registered against Yogendra”, the inspector said.

Police on Sunday scanned CCTV footage on the stretch from KGMU to Teele Waali Masjid to identify more protestors and book them. So far, nobody has been arrested. AIMIM held a protest march from Ghanta Ghar to Teele Waali Masjid and raised slogans against the new citizenship law. Speaking to TOI, additional superintendent of police (west) Vikas Chandra Tripathi said, protestors raised anti-India slogans and did not take administration’s permission to lead protests.

Our members don’t fear going to jail for holding a peaceful march,” he said. MIM will continue statewide protest if the government does not revoke cases against members, he said.

Lucknow,"FASTag Day one: Toll cams blink, can’t read stickers","LUCKNOW: The FASTag, affixed to a vehicle’s windscreen to enable automatic transaction at toll gates, was expected to offer a seamless payment experience. The reality on Day One of its launch was quite the opposite with commuters on Sunday claiming glitches like slow or malfunctioning RFID readers to clueless staff. Common grievances poured from citizens who crossed toll plazas on national highways, including NH-24, NH-24B, NH-25 and NH-27. A TOI survey of these highways too found merit in the complaints. “I am stuck here for the past 20 minutes. Cameras are unable to read the tag fixed on my windscreen and the toll staff are asking me to pay double the usual fee as penalty. This is ridiculous!” motorist Tarun Ahuja sounded livid at Ahmedpur toll plaza on NH-27, which connects Lucknow and Barabanki. According to the ministry of road transport and highways, commuters who do not have a FASTag are expected to cough up double the fee. However, the rules had promised one hybrid lane, where usual toll would be charged from non-FASTag vehicles, for the first few days. Also, to stem anticipated chaos, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was expected to deploy marshals at all the plazas across the country to guide vehicles. The highways where TOI did a recce these mandatory provisions were conspicuously absent, triggering anger and frustration. Naman Saraswat, another commuter at Ahmedpur, said the prepaid tags were meant to reduce time taken at toll gates, but the opposite was happening. “I am waiting in queue for over 30 minutes and am unlikely to cross in another half an hour. There should have been hybrid lanes as promised,” said Saraswat who was in rush to attend a meeting. At Dakhina toll plaza on Rae Bareli road, Harsh Kailash said the problem with FASTag was pandemic on the first day. “Despite tags on our windscreen, we waited and waited. So much so for seamless toll payment and traffic movement on highways. The camera glitches happened everywhere and toll gate staff were clueless what to do,” he added. While the project manager in New Delhi was not available for comments, an NHAI official in Lucknow said teething troubles were always expected when a new technology was being introduced. “These problems are bound to happen. It is a new technology for most employees. Glitches have been taken care of. We expect things to run smoothly from Monday,” he said on the condition of anonymity. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Special Task Force scans vice-chancellor's WhatsApp, summons four law faculty","LUCKNOW: The Special Task Force (STF) of UP Police is poring over “WhatsApp details” extracted from officiating Lucknow University vice-chancellor SK Shukla’s phone in a dogged hunt for person/s who forwarded him tell-tale audio clips to signal the LLB paper leak. The STF has also summoned four members of the law faculty to its head office on Monday. A senior officer privy to the probe said the identity of those who sent the audio clips must be ascertained and their role in the leak questioned. “Hence, some data has been extracted and will be analysed by experts,” he said without divulging further details. Acting SSP STF Vishal Vikram Singh said “the actual investigation” was yet to begin. “We are currently in the first stage of collecting evidence and recording statements of those named in the FIR. Statements of others such as the VC and controller of examinations will also be recorded,” he said. The SSP admitted that four law department teachers had been summoned to the STF headquarters “to know their side of the story” before the probe began. Asked about popular speculation that contents of the audio clips did not quite match with actual questions in the LLB third semester paper, the officer was guarded in his reply. “The question paper, answer sheet and audio clips will be analysed by experts,” he said. The varsity cancelled its LLB third semester examinations, underway since the first week of December, after several audio clips went viral in which two men can be heard dictating questions expected in the tests to a woman. The men are suspected to be law teachers and the woman a student as well as the chairperson of a private medical college. The university had lodged an FIR against three persons, two of them named. The decision to involve the STF was taken on Thursday evening on the directive of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Nadwa erupts, police snuff out stir","LUCKNOW: Over 200 students of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama (Nadwa College), Lucknow, hit the streets late Sunday to express solidarity with their compatriots in Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University, who have been leading fiery protests against the Centre over the Citizenship Amendment Act. Students trooped out of their hostel gate late night, chanting slogans ‘Aawaz do, hum ek hain’ and had barely marched for 10 minutes when police intervened and pushed them back inside the college premises. According to eyewitnesses and videos of impromptu protests, the students were enraged by news trickling in about alleged police action on Jamia and AMU campuses. Eyewitnesses also claimed that police cracked down on a peaceful assembly of students to quickly snuff out protests. Students had blocked the main Nadwa road in front of the mammoth gates of the college, before being pushed inside. Circle Officer, Mahanagar, Sonam Kumar, said, they received a tip-off from passers-by on raging protests outside Nadwa and swiftly reached the spot. “There was no extraordinary law and order breach, but security has been beefed up around the campus,” he said.

Lucknow,Is it a yay or a nay for proposed Sakhi Day at Lucknow Mahotsav,"In a first-of-its kind move, entry for men at the Lucknow Mahotsav will not be allowed. Well, yes, you read that right. Well, not on all the days, but just for a day. Wondering why? The Lucknow Mahotsav, which will be a 10-day event, will be open to women only on January 22, as part of Sakhi Diwas, from 11 am to 4.30 pm. The initiative will be a small festival for women empowerment and to celebrate women power at the Mahotsav. However, entry to female visitors with children up to 10 years of age will be allowed. Commenting on the initiative, Anupam Srivastava, UP Tourism regional director and secretary Lucknow Mahotsava Committee, said, “The idea behind the event is to let ladies enjoy Mahotsava freely without any worry. Since this year we are celebrating the Mahotsav with a theme of Shaan-e-Awadh Jashn-e-Lucknow, we will also celebrate a Sakhi Diwas. And no men will be allowed in the Mahotsav premises on that day for the given time.” (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) The ban on men’s entry for a day seems to have garnered mixed reactions from the visitors at the mega festival.Take for example Savita Kapoor, a recently retired banker in the city and a regular to the Mahotsav every year. “It is an impractical move. I do not understand the logic behind it. Ek toh waise bhi we keep reading in the newspapers that sales go down of the stall owners every year, upar se ab aisa move. The authorities need to understand that the Mahotsav is not organised in the heart of the city. Since it is held at a place like Ramabai Ambedkar Rally Sthal, people usually go in groups, which included both the genders. Ab agar kisi ko yeh news nahi pata aur woh pahunch gaya toh it will be a disappointment for him/her. I don’t think this kind of celebrations are practical in nature,” she rues. Divya Awasthi, a manager at a firm in the city and an occasional visitor at the Lucknow Mahotsav says, “I understand that the intention of celebrating women is interesting but I feel that the execution is not really thought through. Also, most of us women go to the Mahotsav in groups of family and friends that may consist of men. So, in a way you’re stopping us from going with people of our choice. Besides, if the organisers really want to do something special for women, they can host special gender-exclusive contests wherein they can distribute prizes to women.” (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) While the women give a may to the proposed celebration, the menfolk too agree with them. A businessman and a regular to Lucknow Mahotsav every year, Himanshu Dhanuk, says, “Going to Mahotsav is like going for a picnic. In fact, it is more like a family affair for all of us. While the ladies shop, kids enjoy several rides on the swings and in the end we all have dinner there. While the administration should definitely plan special activities and offers for the femme brigade on Sakhi Diwas, I am unable to understand the entry ban for men ka concept. Why should this happen at an event like the Lucknow Mahotsav. People go to the Mahotsav as per their convenience and I am sure we will have several men landing up at the Mahotsav on that day. Wednesday is a day off for many businessmen in Lucknow now. The men entry ban clause should not be there at all!” “I don’t think its an intelligent plan because the venue is far away and it might be a challenge for most women to travel all the way to the Mahotsav all by themselves. I usually go with my husband and kid but if there are things like these happening, I’m not too sure if I’ll travel all the way to Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan Sthal alone,” says Sahiba Madan, a homemaker who visits the Lucknow Mahotsav annually. (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) “Dedicating a day to women at Lucknow Mahotsav is a welcome move but restricting the entry of males even if it’s just for a day is definitely not in good taste,” says Meraj Haider, an entrepreneur in the city, adding, “Celebration of womanhood and their empowerment can be done when women are considered an integral part of the society and living in a society as a whole, we just cannot segregate the two genders. In fact, men must be invited at a platform like this where females are portraying their innate talent to let the men themselves witness the real power of women and that a woman too can be a good entrepreneur. On the practical side, the venue of the Mahotsav is too far as well as deserted and for women who cannot drive commuting becomes a grave problem. These days when crime is at its peak I think either the administration must take some more effective security measures or else rethink on this idea of only- female entry.” (With inputs from Yashi Agarwal and Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) "

Lucknow,"Don’t fear harassers, file a complaint: Cops to girls","Lucknow: A morphed photo shared online, a fake account in their name and flooding of the inbox with obscene messages—these are some of the ways in which girls are harassed online. Scores of women face cyber harassment everyday but do not report the matter to the police or even their family members, fearing social stigma and subsequent curbs on their movement. This was revealed in an interaction of around 500 girls and boys with police officials at the office of 1090 Women Power Line on Monday. The event was organized to mark Nirbhaya Chetna Diwas, observed to mark the seventh anniversary of the day the UP woman was raped and assaulted in Delhi. The most common online harassment girls said they faced was the creation of fake social media accounts in their names. Using these accounts, miscreants send obscene messages to others and also post morphed photographs. “We don’t report it to our families because family members mostly find faults in our conduct and bar us from accessing social media or smartphones. We may even be stopped from going out. People tend to blame the girl facing harassment,” said Pooja, a class XI student. Girls said they just delete obscene content and ignore it. Police told girls to not delete content as it can help trace the culprit. Anonymous complaints can be lodged at 1090 helpline and police will protect the identity of the complainant, officials told the girls. "

Her comments are in sharp contrast to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s stance on the issue. The SP national president has been tweeting his disapproval of NRC and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) since it was tabled in Parliament on December 9. Accusing the ruling BJP of having failed to fulfil any of the promises that it made during elections like doubling farmers’ income or bringing back black money from foreign banks, Akhilesh described the law as an insult to India and its Constitution and the first step towards imposing NRC. On Monday, Aparna took to twitter to question those objecting to NRC and protests at Jamia Milia and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). “Jo Bharat ka hai use register mein ankit hone mein kya samasya hai (Those who belong to India, should have no problem in getting themselves registered)” she tweeted.

Lucknow,Unnao rape survivor upset at acquittal of co-accused: Family,"LUCKNOW: The Unnao rape survivor is feeling dejected that the judgment in her rape case, which holds BJP former MLA from Bangarmau Kuldeep Singh Sengar guilty of raping her, acquits co-accused Shashi Singh, her family told TOI. The rape survivor, who is still recuperating from the trauma of 2017 when she was raped and from her near death accident in July this year, cried all through the afternoon when the judgment by the Delhi special court came, it is said. TOI spoke to both the survivor’s mother and elder sister, who are with her at a safe location since her discharge from AIIMS, New Delhi. Both the women claimed the girl had been upset with Shashi Singh being let off by court. “She has been crying about the order. What Sengar got he deserved. But my daughter is upset with Shashi Singh being acquitted by court. The acquittal has taken away any happiness she could have got from Sengar being convicted for the crime he committed against my daughter and the entire family,” said the rape survivor’s mother. Though the young girl, her family said, was not in a state to speak, in an earlier interview taken by TOI in April this year, she had recounted the role of Shashi Singh in her rape case. “On June, 2017, at around 8pm, I was standing outside my house, when an acquaintance, Shashi Singh, approached me on the premise of getting me a job and took me to MLA Sengar’s house. She pushed me inside a room, where Sengar was present already and stayed outside herself. Sengar then took off his clothes and raped me violently. He stood over me when I resisted and threatened to kill my father and uncle if I raised my voice,” the rape survivor had told TOI in April 2019. On Monday, her elder sister also said, “My sister and all of us believe it will not be complete justice if Shashi Singh is not held for the crime she did.” “It will also not be real justice till our uncle, Mahesh Singh, who had been the one fighting for our rights, is at least given bail by courts where old cases against him are being taken up,” she added. The family also claimed that they are still scared of returning to their village Maakhi. “We have no safety in returning to our home. The other accused in the case are yet to be convicted and their associates are present everywhere. We do not feel safe in such a situation where it is just us girls and no male member of the family with us. Our uncle in jail was the only one looking after us since our father’s death in 2018,” the rape survivor’s sister added. “We welcome the court’s decision and we will see what is to be done and what can be done about the acquittal of Shashi Singh. As of now we are focusing on the other trials underway including the murder case of the survivor’s father,” said advocate Poonam Kaushik, from the team of lawyers representing the survivor in court.

In fact, all the ghats and crematoriums, constructed in the city under Namami Gange, have been constructed by the same construction agency after being allotted the job by the Central government. “I would ask the construction agency to get the staircase repaired at the earliest and make all the steps of the same height,” Bobde added. Engineers India Limited representative Tanveer said, “If asked, we would get it demolished and build a new staircase at Atal Ghat. When the construction work was going on at Atal Ghat, some people who used to perform ‘aarti’ there had requested to provide some space between the stairs so that they could sit and offer prayers.” “Since stairs of the ghat’s bottom were already built, it was decided to alter the height of two stairs in 30 square feet area on the upper side of ghat and create some space for the visitors. As the width of some of the stairs is unequal, they should also be repaired,” he added. The Central government had given a contract of Rs 44.30 crore to the Engineers India Limited for construction of 29 ghats situated on the banks of the river Ganga and four crematoriums. Of these, 11 ghats and two crematoriums are in Kanpur. Similarly, other ghats are in Bithor and Shukla Ganj in Unnao. The construction company had to complete the job in 18 months. It finished the work in 10 months and handed over the finished ghat to the district authorities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently visit the ghat to review the Ganga cleanliness. "

Lucknow,Ram mandir will be rashtra mandir: UP CM Yogi Adityanath,"LUCKNOW: Addressing a campaign rally in an election-bound Jharkhand, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that the Ram temple in Ayodhya would be a “rashtra mandir” (temple of the nation), embodying the soul and ethos of the country. The Ram temple would send a strong message to the world about the strength of India’s democracy and judiciary, reiterated the chief minister, who has been BJP’s star campaigner for Jharkhand elections. The CM said that the first term of the Modi government was dedicated to the welfare of the people, while the second was for building a strong nation. He said that India had always stood for the persecuted and oppressed persons world over. The Hindus, Buddhists and the Parsees were persecuted in adjoining Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh and they had to flee from these countries. With the Citizens Amendment Act, they would get citizenship here, which was not possible during the Congress governments. On the Ram temple, which in his words, “will be a holy place where the soul of India will reside”, Yogi criticised the Congress-led Opposition for delaying the solution. CM further said Ram Rajya meant good governance, equality for all and no discrimination against the poor and the vulnerable. The Modi government at Centre and the Raghubar Das government in Jharkhand were devoted for the welfare of the people, he said. "
Lucknow,No winter thaw: Yogi Adityanath &amp; LoP skip key meet with Speaker,"LUCKNOW: In an unprecedented situation, both chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is Leader of the House, and the Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary stayed away from the all-party meeting called by the Speaker, Hriday Narayan Dikshit, on Monday to draw business of the House for the winter session, which was called to get approval of the second supplementary budget. Before start of the session, the chief minister had called an important cabinet meeting. So, both Yogi and Chaudhary were preoccupied with engagements and failed to attend the Speaker’s meeting. However, absence of two key constitutional heads in the legislative assembly at the crucial all-party meeting points to a brewing confrontation between treasury and Opposition benches. With battle lines drawn between ruling BJP and Samajwadi Party-led Opposition, the fourth assembly session of this year is likely to be stormy. Sensing the aggressive mood of the Opposition and ruling BJP, the Speaker exhorted members to maintain the dignity and decorum during discussions in the House, which is telecast live. The Speaker, who is chairman of a high-powered committee formed by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to recommend improvement in functioning of the House, has expressed concern during the recent unparliamentary behaviour by members of the Opposition. Dikshit has been warning members to avoid taking protest material in their pockets from their home, which could invite disciplinary action. "

Lucknow,Two new shelter homes to be built for homeless,"Lucknow: After TOI highlighted the shortage of permanent shelter homes for the homeless in winter, the district administration on Monday directed Lucknow Municipal Corporation to construct two new permanent shelter homes with capacity of 450 each. However, even that will not be adequate for the homeless population of the city. According to LMC records, there are 23 permanent shelter homes with total capacity of 2,000, while there are around 5,000 pavement dwellers in the city. So far, 1,300 people have been accommodated in the homes. Now, orders have been given to construct two more homes—one at Sapru Marg and another near SGPGI. However, these will be ready by next year. This means that if the 23 existing homes are packed to capacity, around 3,000 homeless people would still be left on the streets. If NGOs are to be believed, there are around 10,000 homeless people in Lucknow. This is apart from more than a lakh living in 38 slums. Earlier, LMC used to provide wood for bonfire for these homeless and slum dwellers, but this year, that has been banned in view of rising air pollution. “Apart from constructing two permanent shelter homes, temporary homes with capacity of around 2,000 people are also being set up. We are ensuring that no homeless person sleeps in the open,” said an official. "

Examinations of all odd semesters of LLB (three-year), LLB (integrated) and LLM started in the first week of December.

LU officers clarified that barring LLB (semester III), examinations of all other law courses held prior to December 12 are valid. The revised schedule is of only those papers which were to be held on and after December 12. Regarding the fate of three papers out of six in LLB (semester III) held before December 11, LU authorities said decision on these papers would be taken after the inquiry committee probing the matter submits its report. A senior LU official said, “If the committee finds out that paper leak is limited to only one person, examination of three papers will stand valid. But if it is found that the leaked paper reached many students, all the three examinations will be held again.” Students on Monday reached the residence of acting VC SK Shukla and alleged laxity on part of Lucknow University authorities. They left only when the VC assured them that the revised examination schedule would be announced by the evening. "

Kanpur,Is LMC listening? PWD swift off blocks in fixing roads for Defence Expo,"LUCKNOW: While the civic authorities have shelved road repairs in the city till January-end citing bone-numbing temperatures, the state public works department (PWD) is showing them how to do it in advance and chill. The PWD has begun renovating arterial stretches of roads that will be used during the Defence Expo scheduled from February 4 to 9. “We started work on December 10 and will complete by next week. We planned the revamp in advance because we knew well that January weather would be too harsh,” said executive engineer Jitendra Kumar. The Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) and its private partners usually prefer to construct new roads between February and March, when the weather is neither too cold nor very hot. Repair work, on the other hand, is done between October and December. Moderate weather is considered best for any construction work. If the temperature is too low, it causes the surface of any newly cast road to cool down faster than its inside. This variation can cause cracks on the surface. Again, if the temperature is too high, more water is needed and can contribute to low road strength. Construction work is best avoided in monsoon for more obvious reasons. The LMC is required to repair a 174km network of roads in different parts of the city while PWD must fix 184km under its jurisdiction. These roads are in localities like Gomtinagar, Mahanagar, Aliganj, Indiranagar, Nishatganj, Narhi, Lalbagh and Hazratganj, among others. The PWD is basically responsible for state highways connecting different districts of UP and some of these pass through the city. For instance, the department has been entrusted with repairs around Parivartan Chowk, Vrindavan Yojana, Charbagh, Alambagh and stretches along Khatu Shyam temple and Hanuman Setu in the city. “We have already covered 70% (130km) of the roads so far,” said a PWD official. “Our initial focus has been on those roads that will be used during the Defence Expo. The Lucknow-Kanpur, Hardoi-Sitapur and Barabanki-Faizabad highways will be repaired later,” he added. "

Lucknow,"No going back on Citizenship Amendment Act, govt firm like rock: Amit Shah","NEW DELHI: Unfazed by protests, home minister and BJP president Amit Shah on Tuesday asserted that the government was determined to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act and said police action at Jamia Millia University was necessitated to contain mob violence in which public property was damaged and the situation had to be brought under control. Addressing the India Economic Conclave, Shah also said one should not exaggerate protests against CAA as around 22 universities witnessed some reactions. Of these, only four campuses — Aligarh Muslim University, Jamia Millia, Lucknow and JNU — witnessed protests on a large scale. “One should know that there are over 400 universities in the country and reports of agitation have been reported from around 22,” Shah said. He said the police action in Jamia was taken against those engaging in vandalism and arson. “Violence in any form can’t be justified. However, do you think law and order can be ensured by waiting for things to worsen?” a combative Shah asked. Read this story in MarathiHe said incidents in Jamia showed that the situation was serious. “It is being probed from where the stones came from.

Lucknow,"‘UP hospitals not in pink of health, facing shortage of docs, facilities’","Lucknow: The number of patients in hospitals and community health centres (CHCs) in the state increased by 33% between 2013 and 2018 while the strength of doctors remained inadequate to provide proper healthcare services, according to CAG report tabled in UP assembly on Tuesday. “There was a crisis of overcrowding with OPD cases rising by 24% in district hospitals, 20% in district women hospitals (DWH) and 12% in CHCs. This had a cascading effect on consultation time given by doctors to patients,” the CAG report noted. According to the report, 86% patients in district hospitals, 69% in DWH and 50% in CHCs got less than five minutes for consultation leading to inadequate diagnosis, investigation and treatment in OPDs. “Waiting time for patients was adversely affected since the number of registration counters were not commensurate with the increase in daily patient load. The situation aggravated in some of the test-checked hospitals/CHCs following lack of suitable and commensurate increase in seating facility and toilets, and an overall weak grievance redressal system,” the report said. CAG recommended review of consultation time in district hospitals and CHCs at the level of director general, medical and health, so that corrective steps may be taken to address the “very short per patient consultation period”. “Inadequacy of registration counters vis-a-vis rising patient demand should be addressed without delay so that waiting time for patients is reduced and seating/toilet facilities be increased,” it added. CAG further observed that despite being the bedrock of evidence-based modern treatment procedures, diagnostic services – both radiological and pathological – were deficient in terms of availability of functional equipment, consumables and human resources in test-checked hospitals/CHCs. The report noted that a majority of DWH and a large number of CHCs did not have basic X-ray facility. “More than half of the district hospitals lack requisite range of X-ray machines, a substantial number of CHCs are without an ultrasonography facility and computed tomography (a technique for displaying representation of a cross section through a human body or other solid object using X-rays or ultrasound) scan is available in less than one-third of eligible hospitals,” it said. The report stated that there were serious gaps in the availability of essential pathological investigations in almost all the hospitals and CHCs. “Besides this, the in-house pathology services were hamstrung by shortage of lab technicians and unsatisfactory quality assurance,” the report said, adding that engaging private service provider to fill the gap did not substantially improve the situation. CAG also found gaps in the availability of in-patient services with more than half the district hospitals lacking a burn ward, an accident trauma ward as well as indoor services for dialysis, physiotherapy and psychiatry whereas pediatric services were available in less than half of the CHCs. “Intensive care unit (ICU) services are available only in Lucknow and Gorakhpur district hospitals out of the 11 test-checked hospitals. In the absence of ICU facility, patients are likely to be referred to higher facility public or private hospitals,” the CAG said. "

Lucknow,Lucknow: Day temperature plunges nine degrees below normal,"LUCKNOW: A blast of dry, icy winds from snow-fed mountains up north sent the Celsius for a tumble in the city on Tuesday with the maximum temperature plummeting nine degrees below normal. The unusually cold day also saw a kilometre-thick layer of fog over the Earth’s surface. The bad news is that this bone-numbing chill will continue till Friday, take a brief break during the weekend and return to torment the city with fresh blasts of the North Wind by Monday or Tuesday. A blast of dry, icy winds from snow-fed mountains up north sent the Celsius for a tumble in the city on Tuesday with the maximum temperature plummeting nine degrees below normalState Met director JP Gupta said the icy winds converted moisture left behind by rain in UP last week into a dense blanket of fog, which hung 3km above the surface. The kilometre-thick fog layer blocked rays of the sun and did not allow the mercury to rise above 14.7 degrees Celsius during the day. In Met parlance, a maximum temperature five degrees below normal is called a ‘cold condition’. The minimum temperature was 11.7 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal, because the same layer of fog did not allow heat from the ground to escape into the atmosphere. The average temperature during the day was around 12 degrees Celsius, but the real feel was like 10 degrees Celsius owing to wind chill, which is basically lowering of body temperature by passing flow of lower temperature air, Gupta explained. .

APAI claimed that a private airliner first asked passengers to board the plane for Hyderabad but later informed them that the flight would take off after eight hours. Claiming that such incidents were common, APAI requested the PM to address the problems of domestic flyers by framing a policy. According to the letter signed by D Sudhakara Reddy, founder and national president of APAI, the flight carrying 112 passengers was scheduled to take off from Lucknow at 9.15pm and land in Hyderabad at 11.15pm on December 12. However, the flight got delayed by over eight hours and took off at 6am on Friday and landed in Hyderabad at 8.19am. According to the letter, passengers were asked by the airliner that delay was due to bad weather and air traffic congestion at Delhi airport, however, independent investigation by APAI suggested it was not the reason for delay. Several stranded fliers took to twitter to highlight their plight and posted their photographs sitting on the floor of the aerobridge. They complained that the airliner neither provided them any accommodation to spend the night nor transport for their journey back home. Sudhakar said APAI did not believe in private airliner’s excuse and demanded compensation for passengers who suffered due to delay. He said no action was being taken by the civil aviation ministry and director general of civil aviation against these private carriers. When TOI contacted a senior officer of the airliner concerned, he refused to comment on the issue. "
Lucknow,"Week after paper leak, panel waits for details from Lucknow University to begin probe","LUCKNOW: The committee formed to investigate the LLB paper leak case in LU has not even begun work on it, six days after it was formed on the day of the incident. The three panel members told TOI that Lucknow University has not provided the requisite information to them to begin probe. Incidentally, on Monday, LU had said that the teachers would be suspended only after the internal inquiry committee gives a report. However, this in itself was a U-turn by LU as the VC had announced on December 11 itself, hours after the incident, that the two teachers had been suspended. On December 11, several audio clips of telephonic conversations had gone viral in which two men, suspected to be Lucknow University law teachers, were heard dictating questions to a LLB semester III student. Soon after, on the VC’s direction, LU authorities had cancelled the examination and lodged FIRs against the two teachers and the woman student. In a press conference, the VC had announced suspension of the two teachers and formation of a two-member committee comprising prof (retired) SK Dwivedi and former controller of examinations prof (retired) Chaman Mehrotra to probe the alleged paper leak. The third member, prof JP Pandey, director of Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur, was added later. The panel members also told TOI that LU had not taken their consent before announcing their names and that they were told of it only on December 14. Further, the members said the intimation letter did not have any mention about who the LU coordinator was for the committee, who would give them case details and when and where they could meet to discuss the case. “As soon as LU convenes the meeting, we will start probe,” said Prof Dwivedi. LU vice-chancellor SK Shukla said the examination department officials looking into the case were occupied with examination work. “Even I was bogged down with administrative issues and could not convene the meeting. As the officers given responsibility to coordinate are busy, I would be doing it myself in a day or two,” he said. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Onion sizzles at Rs 140 per kg once more,"(By: Akshata Mishra) LUCKNOW: On a day the city shivered at a maximum temperature of 14.7°C, onion rates were on fire with the best quality being sold for R s 140/kg once more. This fresh price storm on Tuesday — after a nine-day lull when the edible bulb was available for Rs 40-50 less — had its genesis in exhausted supply from Indore (MP) and Nashik (Maharashtra). Most mandis sold onions for Rs 100-140/kg, depending on quality. The old stock (three weeks or more), which has started going bad, was available for Rs 100-110/kg whereas the onions good enough for a salad platter had a price tag of Rs 140/kg. Those in between (one week to two weeks old) were priced at Rs 120-130/kg. It was on December 8 that the onion had last flaunted the Rs 140 tag in city markets. “We have stopped buying and selling onions because we suffered losses following a drop in demand,” said Lallan Yadav, a vendor in Narhi. An average household that consumed 5kg onion a week is now buying just 250-500gm. Raju, a wholesaler on Sitapur Road, said they too were facing a slump in business. “These days, vendors only buy 50-60kg onions from us. They used to buy a quintal or two earlier,” he said. "
Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh: Two AIMIM netas, four others held for disrupting harmony","LUCKNOW: Lucknow and Pratapgarh police on Tuesday arrested six people, including AIMIM leaders Aziz-ur-Rehman and Israr Ahmad, for trying to disturb communal harmony and violating prohibitory orders. In Lucknow, cops arrested district general secretary of All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) Aziz-ur-Rehman for holding protest in Chowk on December 13 without prior permission of the district administration. Additional superintendent of police (Lucknow West) Vikas Chandra Tripathi told TOI, “Rehman was arrested for taking out a procession near KGMU crossing without informing district authorities. He was also seen inciting students of Nadwa seminary to protest against the government. At his insistence, students blocked roads hindering passage of ambulances.” “Rehman has been booked under charges of rioting, disrupting peace and disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant. Initially, we had also charged him with sedition but revoked it later,” he added. Meanwhile, Lucknow police on Tuesday said any protest organized on December 18 and 19 without prior permission of the district administration would be illegal and those violating the order would be charged with criminal conspiracy. In Pratapgarh, AIMIM leader Israr Ahmad and four other party activists were arrested for violating prohibitory orders by holding a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on the district court premises. Besides Ahmad, other arrested persons were identified as Raqib Khan, Saleem Ahmad, Saqib Ahmad and Sujat Ullah. "
Lucknow,Opposition attacks Uttar Pradesh government over police action in AMU and BHU,"LUCKNOW: The first day of the winter session in Vidhan Parishad was rocked by protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) with Opposition demanding that the government explain police action against student protesters. The House was adjourned twice over the ruckus and finally, Opposition members walked out around 4.15pm after deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said that the Opposition, which had failed to stoke communal violence after the Ayodhya verdict, was using CAA to fuel unrest. In the morning, members of Congress, SP and BSP had demanded the government’s statement on the law and order situation in the state, with reference to lathicharge against students in BHU and AMU. “You are in majority and therefore got the Bill passed but you cannot beat up those who are protesting against it. The government wants to establish police rule in the state,” said SP MLC Shatrudra Prakash. BSP MLC Dinesh Chandra also raised the issue of police entering university campus. He said the government was claiming that there was no opposition to its policies because people had been locked up in their homes. Comparing the situation to the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy, leader of Opposition Ahmed Hasan said that even then, people had been protesting peacefully till the British soldiers fired at them. BJP, he said, was doing the same thing. Responding to the Opposition, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said that the recent violence had been fuelled by rumours. “Those who were rejected by the public are using students for their means. The government is working well and people’s support is clear in the way BJP is winning elections. We have proof that the police are being maligned. In the name of protests, one cannot resort to violence. In AMU, it was only when the registrar called the police that they entered the premises. Police began lathicharge only after 18 personnel were injured,” he said. "
Lucknow,BJP MLAs protest against own government in Uttar Pradesh assembly,"LUCKNOW: In a rare development, the inaugural day of the winter session of the Uttar Pradesh assembly on Tuesday saw nearly 100 BJP MLAs staging a dharna in the House, shouting slogans against their own government in open defiance of senior ministers who tried to persuade them to give up the unprecedented protest. The MLAs called off their agitation after four hours following the intervention of Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit, who promised to take up their grievances with CM Yogi Adityanath who was away campaigning in Jharkhand. It was a huge embarrassment and opposition Samajwadi Party MLAs rubbed it in by joining their BJP rivals in a gesture of ""solidarity"". Sources said the matter has been brought to the notice of of BJP's central leadership and there were indications that party’s working president J P Nadda had sought a report from the state unit. Adityanath, who was briefed about the embarrassing development on his return, was also learnt to have held talks with senior colleagues. The trigger for the unusual spectacle came from BJP MLA from Loni, Nand Kishore Gujjar, who was upset for being denied the opportunity to raise the issue of ""fake"" cases foisted on him by UP police. Seeing the mood of the BJP MLAs, SP MLAs too trooped to the floor of the House and raised slogans like “vidhayak ekta zindabad” and demanded protection for the aggrieved MLA. “It is unfortunate that even MLAs of the ruling party in power are not safe and satisfied,” leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary said. Amid the pandemonium in the House, Dixit hurriedly adjourned the House around 2 pm until Wednesday. However, the agitated MLAs, both from BJP and opposition, continued to squat on the floor of the House or sat on their benches. Repeated attempts by parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna to pacify Gujjar and other MLAs proved futile as they continued their protest from their benches despite the House being adjourned. This is first time in the history of the state when MLAs of the ruling party have staged a demonstration in the House, demanded protection from police and blamed their own government for not reining in bureaucracy and police. “Hamari koi sunwai nahi hai (our voices are not heard),” said most of the MLAs. After a failed attempt by Khanna, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma made an attempt to talk about the issue with the protesting MLAs,but to little avail. It was only when the Speaker called some of the disgruntled MLAs to his chamber that they relented and agree to talk. “Some MLAs had some issues to raise. I have given them a hearing,” said Dixit. As soon as Adityanath left the House for campaigning in Jharkhand, the MLAs grouped together and began raising their hands in the House, shouting slogans against the police and demanded action against “erring” officials. Gujjar has been sulking for about a fortnight since an FIR was lodged by the local police against him and his supporters following his tussle with a local food inspector over licences for meat shops. Sources said the FIR was lodged by the food inspector after a verbal duel with the MLA. The MLA, it is said, approached the CM to protest against the government functionary but failed to get the FIR dropped. Following this, Gujjar wrote a detailed letter to Yogi, stating that he was not feeling safe and that the CM should get him booked for heinous offences so that he got jailed as he did not feel safe. The party treated this an act of indiscipline and sought an explanation from the MLA. The situation took an ugly turn when Gujjar was, sources claim to claimed, fired at by some unknown persons while returning from Meerut recently. The MLA claimed he had survived but the windscreen of his car was smashed. While the police lodged an FIR against two unknown bike-borne persons, Gujjar remained unsatisfied and is believed to have lobbied party MLAs to support him.

Lucknow,Where are anti-Romeo squads?: Opposition,"LUCKNOW: Noisy scenes rocked Vidhan Parishad on Wednesday as Opposition parties cornered the government over incidents of crime against women in the state. Deepak Singh of Congress and Dinesh Chandra of BSP had a heated exchange with deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma when Opposition members claimed UP had become synonymous with rapes. Demanding that the statement be struck off the record, Sharma said while rapes could not be condoned, it would be incorrect to say that UP was known only for rapes. Asking what happened to the much-hyped anti-Romeo squads set up by BJP after coming to power, leader of Opposition Ahmed Hasan alleged the government was shielding criminals, therefore, very few cases of crime against women were being filed.  The deputy CM said the government was taking prompt action in all cases. He said since its inception, anti-Romeo squads have lodged 5,361 FIRs and issued warnings to about 30 lakh people. "

Kanpur,"Cold shocker: City shivers at 12.6, mercury to dip further","Kanpur: The city recorded the coldest day of the last 48 years on Wednesday with day temperature touching the 12.6 degrees Celsius mark which was 10 degrees below normal. On Tuesday, the day temperature recorded was at 16.6 degrees while the minimum temperature was just 8.6 degrees. The night temperature was normal but the day temperature plunged to 10 degrees below the normal value. December 18 had never been so chilly since 1971, said the Met department of SCA University. The day temperature on December 18, 2011, had dipped to 14.6 degrees Celsius while on this very day between 2008 and 2018, the maximum temperature hovered between 20 degrees and 25 degrees Celsius. The heavy snowfall in the hills of Uttarakhand and lower ranges of Himalayas was the reason behind the intense cold weather condition, the Met department stated. The dry weather spell would continue for the next few days and there would be no relief from the present cold weather condition, it added. According to the Met department in charge, Prof Naushad Khan there are all possibilities that temperature would go down further in the coming days but there are no chances of rain. He said that for the first time in the season, the temperature dipped by over 10 degrees from the normal temperature. The normal day temperature in December is generally around 22.6 degrees Celsius, he added. The doctors have advised the elderly people and children to protect themselves from the prevailing cold conditions especially during the early morning and evening hours. They have advised the morning walkers to avoid coming out of their homes and that children should not be sent to school. According to medical experts, air pollution and the cold wave is causing health problems and there is a rush of patients in the cardiology departments of the hospitals in the city due to cold attack.

The memorandum calls the VC’s claim ‘false’, and says such allegations question credibility of teachers and malign the university’s image. “Model papers of competitive exams are also available in the market. They are made from the same syllabus as question papers. Hence there can be some similarities, but that doesn’t make a ground to question credibility of teachers,” Verma told TOI. He said Shukla must produce evidence in support of his claim. "

Lucknow,Furry friends need warmth and care to beat winter bugs,"LUCKNOW: Niralanagar resident Akash Maheswari had to rush to the vet because his dog refused to eat for two days and sneezed too often for comfort. The vet said it had flu owing to long exposure to outside temperatures, much to Maheswari’s surprise. “Mine is a German shepherd, a breed known to do great in cold weather. I didn’t realise pets could catch a cold like us. I no longer let my dog sit in the courtyard,” Maheswari said, adding that he had also bought woollens for his furry friend. Like the Niralanagar resident, many pet owners don’t know dogs can be very vulnerable to cold. They can contract flu, allergies, diarrhoea and even suffer a cold shock (hypothermia). Vet Gopal Krishna Shukla in Gomtinagar said he was attending to 15 pets with cold-related ailments every day since the start of December. “If owners ensure warmth, keep pets hydrated and offer protein-rich diet, these problems can be avoided,” he said. Vet Anoop Singh in Krishnagar advocated “warmth and humidity” in bird cages. “Cold causes breathing difficulty and dry air affects their mucous membrane,” he said. Vet Divyani Singh in Indiranagar recommended indoor exercises for pets. “Like humans, they should be served warm food and water,” she added. "

Lucknow,"Edu staff appraisal, transfer on cards","Lucknow: Taking cue from the rural development department, the secondary education department is all set to roll out a performance-based appraisal and transfer system for its class I and II officers. The transfers will be done on the basis of a preferential ranking. Department joint secretary JS Dubey on Wednesday constituted a 10-member committee — headed by additional secretary (secondary education) Manju Sharma and with joint director (secondary education) VK Pandey as its member-secretary — to decide on the indicators for performance-based online transfer of officials. The committee has district inspector of schools (DIOS), basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) and principal of District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) among other secondary education officers as its members. The committee must decide on the indicators and report to the government within 15 days. The performance-based appraisal and transfer system, officials said, follows the pattern set by the rural development department. “The indicators will obviously be different,” said a senior official. Once the parameters are set, the class I and class II officers will be awarded marks on the basis of their performance against assigned targets. Thereafter, a merit list will be released. Based on the scores, those eligible for transfer will have to fill in places of their choice. Options will be highest for the best scorer and gradually decrease. Officials, on condition of anonymity, admitted that the merit-based transfer was a boon amid recent disputes over posting in basic and secondary education departments. “Hope it (the system) includes basic education officers too,” said an official.

Amid raging protests against the Citizen Amendment Act, Athawale said law was not against Muslims. “Muslims should not get instigated by some groups with vested political interests,” he said, while hailing the second term of Narendra Modi for taking key decisions that changed the socio-political discourse of the country. He said abrogation of Article 370 and 35A from Jammu and Kashmir were one of the important decisions taken by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. "

Of these, 988 girls were murdered after rape. The period covers the terms of SP as well as BJP governments. The submission was made in the Assembly by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in response to a question raised by BSP MLA Sushma Patel who sought to know the number of minors who were raped and murdered between January 2015 and October 2019. She also asked how many cases were registered and the number of charge sheets filed. Responding to the query, the CM said besides 9,703 cases of rape, 988 murders were reported during the said period. Likewise, over 25,600 kidnappings and 2,607 cases of serious crimes were reported.

Lucknow,My parents are till date clueless about what made my video viral: Priya Prakash Varrier,"The overnight internet sensation, Priya Prakash Varrier, better known as the ‘Wink Girl’, who shot to fame with her winking scene from the Malayalam film 'Oru Adaar Love', is shooting for her second Bollywood film in Lucknow. Shooting for Love Hackers, Priya, a complete foodie, went out with us for Ganjing, where she stopped at a chaat corner to have basket chaat and paani batashas. Soon after the pate pooja, Priya sat with us and talked about her journey so far down South and in Bollywood, her over night stardom and her experience of shooting in Lucknow. You have been shooting in Lucknow for quite some time now. Is it your first visit here?I am coming to Lucknow for the first time and the first thing I learnt about Lucknow was ki ‘Muskuraiye ki aap Lucknow mein hain’. I have not got a chance to explore the place much as it is mostly hotel-shoot-hotel for me. But I would definitely like to explore Lucknow once I get a proper break. I would specially like to check Lucknow’s famous chikankari work. Apart from chikan, what I know about Lucknow is that it is a city of nawabs which is famous for kebabs. Wow that actually rhymed! (laughs) The shooting experience has been really chilled here. It is winters here and I can’t stand the cold. I was already told in advance about Lucknow ki thand so I have come all prepared with my sweaters and jackets to beat the Lucknow ki sardi. And yes, I loved yahan ki chaat. I got a chance to eat the basket chaat and paani-poori and they were yummy. Priya Prakash Varrier (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Priya Prakash Varrier (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Tell us about your second Bollywood film Love Hackers for which you are shooting in Lucknow.I play a Lucknow girl in the film. When the makers of the film approached me with the script, I was clearly told that the movie is going to be a serious one with the dark side of the social media. According to them, I was a perfect choice for the role as whatever has happened to me has happened via social media. They felt I would be the best person to tell others that there can be a dark side to social media as well. The story revolves around cyber crime. Talking about the dark side of the social media, did you personally also face any such thing once you became the ‘wink girl’ over night?Not really. I became an internet sensation over night and it took me a lot of time to cope up and realize what was happening with me. I remember a night before that song got released, I was anxiously waiting to watch myself as there was a little bit of me shown in the song. I was in it for just 20 to 30 seconds. I was very tensed and excited as I didn’t know how it was going to look, finally. It was supposed to release in the evening and I was waiting to get the link and share it with my friends and family. But the director and everyone in the film told me earlier that my portion in the song had come out really well and it is going to be a hit.I finally managed to get the link from a friend, watched myself in the song, shared it with all my acquaintances and then happily went off to sleep. But the next morning, when I woke up and saw my mobile phone, it had so many calls, mostly from newspapers and news channels and I got to know that I had become an internet sensation overnight. I logged in to my instagram account and it just went boom with thousands of followers. Earlier my account was private but I changed it to a public one, a night before the release of this song. From 1000 followers within hours I had more than 15 thousand followers and now I have 7.4 million followers. I was always very active on my social networking accounts. But earlier I used to post any random thing which came to my mind as it was my private space but now I have to filter a lot of things and think 10 times before posting something. I have been trolled also so many times. But when I see memes and trolls which are really funny I share it myself. But some trolls and memes hurt as well. But then it is fine, I am now becoming used to trolls. Now if I don’t see any trolls, I am like why are people not trolling me? (laughs) Priya trying her hands at making the basket chaat in Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav/ Location courtsey: Royal Cafe) Priya trying her hands at making the basket chaat in Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav/ Location courtsey: Royal Cafe) How did your family react to your overnight stardom? Your dad is sitting with us today, if he too can add on how he felt about it?Priya: I remember my parents’ reaction very well. One question that both my mom and dad asked me was what is there in this video that it is going viral. My parents are till date clueless about what made my video viral. Prakash Varrier, Priya’s father: When we saw Priya’s winking video, we liked it, but till date we are not able to understand why the nation went crazy after Priya’s winking. Did you always want to be an actress?From a very young age I knew I was going to be become an actress. Even my parents knew I had chosen this career for myself. They only wanted to me to be a graduate and then peruse my dream. I was doing BCom first year when I gave my first audition and got my first film. I played a school girl in that film. I was very raw then, I had to be myself in that. I then did a Telugu and Kannada movie and took workshops for acting. With each movie that I am doing, I am growing and getting to learn a lot of things. But even today I have that self-doubt after a scene. You have worked in movies down South and in Bollywood. Any striking difference that you notice in the working style of both the industries?The only difference between the two industries is that in South the timings for the shifts are fixed from early morning to early evening. But in Bollywood timings are not fixed. Movies down South are making news nationally and the industry is growing in leaps and bounds. So has it outgrown Bollywood or is in that process, with actors and filmmakers here aspiring to work there as well?South cinema, if I talk about Malayalam films, has always been known for the best content. I have followed Malayalam films but Kannada and Telugu I have just started following now because I am a part of it. But talk about Bollywood, I have always watched Hindi movies. In fact, I have always tried to follow all the buzz related to the actors here. I love Deepika Padukone and Vicky Kaushal, they are my favourites and I know everything about them. South stars have started doing Bollywood films a lot now. When we talk about entertainment, the first thing we talk about is Bollywood. People from the South have always had Bollywood aspirations. "

Lucknow,"2 die in Mangaluru, 1 in Lucknow as anti-CAA stir spreads across India","Two protesters were killed in police firing on Thursday in Mangaluru while one died of gunshot wounds in Lucknow as the agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act, brewing since last week flared up nationwide. Lucknow police chief Kala Naithani, however, said cops didn’t fire a single bullet during protests. “It’s yet to be established how Mohammed Wakil suffered a bullet wound,” he told TOI. Huge crowds came out on to the streets of cities and towns that were so far untouched by the unrest. Parts of UP, including Lucknow, and Mangaluru in Karnataka witnessed the day's most violent protests, with mobs vandalising public property and clashing with the police at several places. Two protesters in Mangaluru died and several were injured after the police opened fire on a crowd that had allegedly attempted to set fire to the North police station. Mangaluru police commissioner PS Harsha identified the two men as Jaleel Bengre, 49, and Nauseen Kudroli, 23. In Lucknow, two police outposts, three OB vans, at least six cars and a government bus were set ablaze. Hazratganj and the old city were under siege for around five hours, with vandalism overshadowing what had started out as processions of protesters from various locations. At least 172 people were arrested across UP, 112 of them in Lucknow. Another 1,500 people were detained for defying Section 144. Sources said around 3,000 people, including political leaders and activists, had received official notices warning them against taking part in the anti-citizenship Act protests. Ten of them were put under house arrest. In Bengaluru, historian Ramachandra Guha was among the many people detained for participating in a rally against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Town Hall. By the end of the day, the number of detentions in the city for violating prohibitory orders touched 1,000. To get around Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of five or more people, students and staff at IIM-Bangalore stepped out in batches of three to protest against the citizenship law outside the campus gates. Prof Deepak Malghan said about 75 to 100 faculty members, students and staff participated in the unique relay protest from 6pm. Protests were also reported in Hubballi, Kalaburagi, Hassan, Mysuru and Ballari. In each of these places, the police detained protesters by citing Section 144. Mumbai, too, raised its voice against the new citizenship law with a 25,000-strong afternoon rally at the August Kranti Maidan. Led by students, the three-hour rally saw many celebrities, including actors Farhan Akhtar, Swara Bhaskar, Jim Sarbh and Sushant Singh, and director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra turning up to show solidarity with the protesters. ""Today, Mumbai students and youngsters have shown that they can take charge of their country. We cannot afford to stand and watch as the government makes laws to break up this nation,"" Fahad Ahmad, a student of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, told TOI. Bihar was partially affected by a dawn-to-dusk bandh called by the Left parties against the citizenship law and the plan to create a National Register of Citizens (NRC) for every state. Movement of passenger trains was affected in four divisions of East Central Railway during the bandh. Supporters of two political outfits — JAP, led by former Madhepura MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, and VIP, headed by Mukesh Sahni — made their presence felt with protests in Patna and neighbouring Vaishali district. Hundreds of activists of two student organisations — AISA and AISF— squatted on the rail tracks at Patna's Rajendra Nagar terminal around 7am and disrupted train services. Joined by Sahni's group later, the protesters later blocked Old Bypass Road before the police chased them away. In Jaipur, a procession from Khasa Kothi to Collectorate Circle was a counter to rallies by BJP's legal cell and ABVP in support of the citizenship law. It was the same in Ajmer, with rallies both for and against the new Act. Union minister of minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi cancelled a scheduled visit to Ajmer. Gujarat's minority-dominated areas were brought to a standstill by a bandh called by civil rights groups. Violence erupted in some areas of Ahmedabad and Vadgam, where protesters pelted stones at the police in retaliation to lathicharge and tear gas shells fired at them. At least 30 people, including eight police personnel, were injured in clashes in the Shahpur, Shah-e-Alam, Khanpur and Mirzapur areas of Ahmedabad. Chhapi town, 17km from Palanpur in Gujarat's Banaskantha district, was on the edge after hundreds of people from the minority community jammed the Ahmedabad-Abu highway. A mob made an unsuccessful attempt to overturn a police vehicle. Three people were detained for unlawful assembly, but were released in the evening. In communally sensitive Godhra, business establishments in the minority-dominated areas remained shut through the day. Parts of Vadodara were also affected by the bandh. In Nagpur, around 20 Dalit, OBC and Muslim organisations took out a rally in Nagpur amid heavy security in view of the ongoing winter session of the Maharashtra assembly. The protesters were joined by a couple of Congress leaders. Pune saw a protest march from Mahatma Phule Wada till Lokmanya Tilak statue in Mandai that was attended by thousands of citizens. Students of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad organised a match at Pune University. Minority-dominated areas of Malegaon observed a bandh in protest against the citizenship law. Over two lakh powerloom units remained closed along with other commercial establishments and educational institutes. Thousands of Muslims took part in a silent protest march, following which they submitted a memorandum to a representative of the district collector. In Telangana, a busload of students from the University of Hyderabad was taken into preventive custody on their way to join a procession. Six students of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Hyderabad, were also detained at Nampally and sent to Ramgopalpet police station. There were allegations about the police detaining even people who weren't participating in the protests. ""I was out shopping with my son. Suddenly, a group of women cops asked me to accompany them to the police station,"" said Afsarunisa, a homemaker. The only rally to receive official sanction was the one organised by Citizens Against NRC &amp; CAA in Telangana. Over 500 people joined the protest on Necklace Road, raising slogans, reading the preamble to the Constitution and tearing up copies of the amended citizenship Act. Kolkata, where CM Mamata Banerjee had led an anti-CAA rally two days ago, saw students from Presidency University, Jadavpur University, Aliah University and Satyajit Ray Film and television Institute participate in processions against the new law. Another rally in the heart of the city was attended by 50,000-odd citizens. Prohibitory orders were clamped in Bhopal, where protesters had gathered at Iqbal Maidan in the morning, along with 46 other MP districts after clashes in Khandwa. Thousands of people had converged on Khandwa's Idgah Maidan for a sit-in around 10.30am. The Shahar Qazi addressed the gathering during the hour-long protest. As the crowd started to disperse, some youngsters started marching towards Pardesipura, leading to an altercation with the police. Khandwa SP Shivdayal Singh denied there was any lathicharge on the protesters, including some minors. In Thiruvananthapuram, the trigger for protests were the arrests of Yechury and Raja in Delhi. Members of several Left outfits marched towards Raj Bhavan. The Social Democratic Party of India protested the arrest of its national secretary Taslim Ahmed Rehmani in Delhi. ""We condemn the arrest of senior leaders like Sitaram Yechury, D Raja and Ramachandra Guha. The central government should not be under the impression that protests can be silenced by blocking freedom of movement and freedom of opinion,’’ Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan said. Chennai didn't witness any major protest because the police would swoop down on any potential assembly, either near campuses or along the main roads of the city. Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan and members of his Makkal Neethi Maiyam party were prevented from entering the Madras University campus to meet students. In Trichy, the police detained 30 SFI members for trying to block trains. Protests against the citizenship law were reported in some Vellore colleges. Chandigarh saw several protests, including one in front of the Sector 20 mosque and another by students of Punjab University. Mohali in Punjab had small protest gatherings, as did Patiala, Jalandhar, Sangrur and Bathinda in Punjab and Rohtak and Kurukshetra in Haryana. Odisha witnessed protest rallies in Sambalpur and Rourkela, besides Salipur in Cuttack district. "
Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh: Vidhan Parishad session concludes sans debate on education bill,"LUCKNOW: The Vidhan Parishad ended a day ahead of schedule on Thursday with almost no discussions on the supplementary budget or the UP Education Selection Services Bill, both of which were passed amid protests by the Opposition. The day began with protests as Samajwadi Party members scaled the gates of Vidhan Bhawan to register their opposition to the Citizenship Act. It also ended in protest with the Opposition members, joined by the Shikshak Dal, sitting in the well of the House to protest the passing of the UP Education Selection Services Bill. Among those on protest was OP Sharma, the senior most member of Vidhan Parishad who was officially standing in for chairperson Ramesh Yadav who is unwell.  Having nominated another colleague to fill in for him while he took a break, Sharma was at his seat when the bill, which he was opposing, came up for vote. SP and Congress members wanted the bill to be referred to the select committee, saying that combining all three education levels (secondary, primary and higher) under one commission would lead to their saffronisation. Earlier in the day, SP MLCs also protested in the well of the House over a notice issued to leader of Opposition Ahmed Hasan on Thursday morning through an outpost incharge, telling him not to participate in any CAA/NRC protest.  “Is this a democracy or an autocracy? The police are acting on the orders of the government. There is an environment of terror in the state,” he said. Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma responded to Hasan, reminding him of the time when former chief minister Kalyan Singh received a similar notice from the police but instead of creating a fuss over it, he had invited the personnel into his home and offered them tea. SP MLC Shatrudra Prakash was the lone speaker on the supplementary budget, saying that the government had been hiding data and was not giving any explanation for what it had done with or how it was planning to spend Rs 5 lakh crore cleared in the budget and the two supplementary budgets.

Jalshakti minister Mahendra Singh shared this information in the UP Assembly on Thursday.

Lucknow,"Anti-CAA stir: Protest rages, traffic crawls, Lucknow stops","LUCKNOW: Violence during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in various parts of the city threw normal life out of gear on Thursday. Several prominent markets were closed and public transport was not available for people who got stuck in areas where violence broke out. In Hazratganj, people were seen running for cover. Vertika Sinha, who got stranded in Hazratganj, said: “Situation has turned so violent. They are burning vehicles and throwing stones. There is no public transport available at this point of time. Even cabs are not available.” Ayush Tyagi, another city resident, said: “I came to Sapru Marg with my younger brother to purchase jackets.

Anil Singh of Madiaon, who was in Khadra to see his uncle at a private hospital, was caught in mayhem. Cops stopped him from visiting the hospital. “I have been waiting for two hours outside the hospital just to see my uncle. I may sustain injuries as protesters are pelting stones and police are cane-charging them,” he said. Students had their own set of problems. Aanchal Gupta, a Lucknow University student, said: “After my examination got over, I struggled to reach home as no conveyance was available on University road. Even Metro services were unavailable at that moment. I had to walk for kilometres in search of conveyance.” Traffic also crawled in various parts of the city. Himanshu Srivastava, a commuter at Lalbagh, said: “I was stuck in traffic for 25 minutes. I am afraid some miscreant can damage my vehicle.” Arjun Kumar of Laxmibai Marg said few stones fell in his house during protest. “Children were terrified due to mayhem outside. I locked windows and doors. When I went to the terrace, I saw smoke rising nearby.” Vishal Yadav, a 15-year-old badminton player, who had come for training at KD Singh Babu Stadium, said: “Due to violence on the streets, our coach stopped us from going out.

Lucknow,UP Assembly functioned for only four hours in three days,"LUCKNOW: “You should resign from your positions. You have not been voted for creating a din in the Assembly. You have been voted to act responsibly. Honourable Speaker, if these people do not restore peace I would request you to please adjourn the House indefinitely”, said an agitated Suresh Khanna, minister for parliamentary affairs. The minister, also holding charge of finance and medical education, was warning the MLAs of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress who had plunged into the Well of the House protesting against police detaining their workers and civil society members before their protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Amid the din, Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit declared the Assembly adjourned indefinitely as the Question Hour was disrupted by the Opposition. Before the House was adjourned, the Assembly passed the second supplementary budget of over Rs4,200 crore, apart from six new Bills. The supplementary budget was tabled by finance minister Suresh Khanna on the opening day of the session on December 17, but it was passed without any discussion on Thursday. Earlier, as soon as the Assembly began at 11am, Leader of the Opposition, SP’s Ram Govind Chaudhary protested against the police crackdown and his party’s MLAs rushed to the Well of the House, followed by Aradhana Mishra of the Congress. Repeated appeals by the Speaker for peace and normalcy proved futile leading to the indefinite adjournment of the House, which was supposed to function till December 24. However, Chaudhary and BSP’s Lalji Verma described the decision as unconstitutional and undemocratic. The parliamentary affairs minister said that the Opposition had been disrupting the House for the last three days and in the name of law and order it was not allowing the business of the House to be conducted. Later on, the office of the Speaker said that out of the three sittings of the House in the last three days, 7.37 hours and 3.11 minutes were wasted in adjournments and the House functioned for only 4.26 hours. Apart from the routine supplementary budgets of the Yogi government, this House would find a special mention in the political records because of the manner in which a large number of MLAs of the ruling BJP squatted and staged a dharna against their own government.

He was stranded at Satkhanda, where protesters were being pushed back, when suddenly all hell broke loose. “Stones were being hurled and police resorted to lathicharge so he ran inside a lane along with other protesters.” Sharfuddin said. “When he got trapped amidst protesters with groceries in hand, he began moving towards the police. I am told he was shot at from point-blank range,” the father claimed. KGMU Trauma Centre faculty in charge, Prof Sandeep Tiwari, said, “Wakil was brought with a gunshot injury in his abdomen. He died during treatment. It cannot be confirmed who brought him to the medical facility or from where he was brought. But he came at the time of protests.” “Two others were also brought to the Trauma Centre with firearm injury in their abdomen, including a 15-year-old boy. Both are critical and undergoing surgery. Two others injured with multiple injuries were being treated. One of them is on ventilator support,” Prof Tiwari said. Senior Superintendent of Police, Lucknow, Kalanidhi Naithani, confirmed that a youth died of gun-shot injuries, but said police did not fire a single bullet during protests. "
Lucknow,"Protesters post, stay ahead of all clampdown","NEW DELHI: It was a day when social media became an indispensable mass instrument for disseminating rapid information. On Thursday, as anti-CAA protests rocked the nation, dissenters relayed short videos and put out photographs of the demonstrations on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to keep everyone connected and on the ball. There were also live updates from protest sites, pleas for aid, advisories by lawyers and offers of help. In Bengaluru, minutes after historian Ram Guha was detained, social media erupted. Tweets flew in even from abroad. Around 12pm, Ram Guha was trending on the seventh spot in India. In Delhi, with section 144 imposed in both Red Fort and Mandi House, the two main gathering points for protestors, police swiftly detained people and whisked them away in buses. They also dispersed the crowd. But people found ways to communicate what the next meeting point would be: Shahid Park, Barakhamba Road, Jantar Mantar. One of the protestors at Mandi House, who was busy with his phone broadcasting live videos on Facebook, told TOI that the purpose was to make sure that “everyone had proper information”. The suspension of internet service in affected areas did affect connectivity, but several people had come prepared. There were advisories on how to tweet through text messages. Purpose was singular – to be ahead of the curve and pass on information. As politician Yogendra Yadav was being led away by police, he tweeted in real time the location where he was being taken. “I have just been detained from Lal Qila. About a thousand protesters already detained. Thousands on the way. Am told we are being taken to Bawana,” Yadav wrote around 12pm. Pictures from Mumbai, Kalaburagi, Patna, Ahmedabad and Lucknow were also shared widely to inform netizens of the wide scale of the protests. Gujarat politician Jignesh Mevani also tweeted about his detention. Videos showing political activist Umar Khalid being led away by police while shouting slogans asking for the repeal of CAA was also shared live by protestors at the Red Fort. Even Mastodon, an open-sourced platform, whose policies are driven by its users, had a message for India. “We do realize that the internet itself may have been shut down in certain parts of India by their government. If that's the case, our software can be configured to operate via LAN as a private instance, though that does severely hamper the organizing potential. Stay safe!” the platform tweeted from its verified handle on Tuesday to allay fears of communication blockade. Several posters and memes also went viral on Twitter. One of them showed a college student offering a red rose to Delhi police. A video of students offering roses to cops was also posted by the account diary_of_jamian, an Instagram page that shares information on Jamia Milia University. The picture, with the caption ""tum students pe goli chalate ho, aur gulab se darr jate ho,"" garnered over 30,000 views in just 4 hours. "
Lucknow,Parivartan Chowk suddenly turned vortex of violence,"LUCKNOW: The bustling Parivartan Chowk, a key transit point between cis and trans-Gomti areas and 50m from the city’s biggest thoroughfare Hazratganj, was a vortex of violence during protests against the new citizenship law on Thursday. Many peaceful protesters who were caught in the crossfire later attributed the sudden spiral of violence to infiltration of anti-social elements in the crowd and police mismanagement. There was no significant activity at the crossing till 1.30pm, when people started trickling in small groups. Not allowed by police to gather at the intersection, they moved to a nearby road leading to the old high court building. Some carried posters of Kakori train action heroes — Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqulla Khan who were hanged by Britishers on December 17-19, 1927 — to commemorate their death anniversaries. Holding hands and leaving enough room for two-wheelers to pass through, the small crowd included young girls, women and children, who sang and chanted slogans while holding aloft placards and the tricolour. Aparna Singh, a student, said, “Not giving permission for peaceful protest is dictatorship.” Another protester, Radhika Dikshit said, “We are forced to come out on roads as government was not listening to our demands.” Many protesters were detained by police, bundled into buses and sent to Vibhuti Khand police station from where they were released. “We respect the law, but defied prohibitory orders to make the government hear our voice,” said activist Deepak Kabir. In the meantime, reports of violence at Khadra and Thakurganj arrived at around 3pm, forcing authorities to rush security forces to these two places. While police were dealing with the crowd there, people started arriving in droves at Parivartan Chowk from both Hazratganj and Kaiserbagh. The gathering swelled into hundreds by 4pm after police opened the gate of Begum Hazrat Mahal Park, allowing protesters on the opposite side to join those at the Chowk. Some of the protesters tried to head towards the main crossing when police pushed them back. Heated exchanges ensued followed by a brisk lathicharge, leading to a stampede-like situation. In the melee, someone hurled a stone at police, who retaliated with more caning and a free-for-all followed. Some in the crowd responded by heavy stone-pelting and setting several vehicles on fire. Police then fired teargas shells and water cannon to disperse protesters. The clash continued for about an hour. Firetenders were rushed in to douse the flames. "
Kanpur,UP: Fatehpur rape survivor dies after five-day battle for life,"KANPUR: The 18-year-old wo- man, who was allegedly raped and set ablaze by her uncle in Fatehpur on December 14, succumbed to burns on Thursday morning after battling for life for five days at Lala Lajpat Rai hospital in Kanpur. She had suffered over 90% burns. This is the second case in UP this month where rape survivors have died after being set on fire. Earlier on December 5, a 23-year-old rape survivor was set ablaze by five men in Unnao. She died during treatment at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on December 7. “The woman had suffered multiple organ failure that led to her death. The medical team attended her well and tried to save her. Since she had suffered over 90% burns, her organs stopped functioning,” a doctor at LLR Hospital said, adding that the woman was put on ventilator support after multi-organ dysfunction. The police have sent the body for post-mortem examination. The victim was alone at her home on December 14 when her uncle barged into the house and allegedly raped her. When she resisted, he poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. The woman rushed out of her house screaming and crying for help. The victim’s neighbour doused the flames and informed cops. According to Fatehpur SP Prashant Verma, an FIR was lodged on the basis of a complaint by the woman’s family and the accused was arrested. According to the victim’s father, the accused was a distant relative. In the first complaint, the victim’s brother had claimed that the woman immolated herself as she felt insulted and abused after being raped, but in the second complaint, he accused the uncle of setting her afire. In her statement too, the woman had claimed that her uncle raped and set her on fire. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)"
Lucknow,I wanted to change the belief ki ladkiyan bike nahi chala sakti: Lucknow girl Anam Hashim,"Lucknow girl Anam Hashim had no idea that her curiosity would turn into a passion. Anam, went on to become the first woman in the country to ride all the way to the Khardung-La Pass situated at the height of 17,582 ft, not once but twice. Later, taking to stunt biking was a natural progression for Anam, who was egged by the common belief that ‘ladkiyan mobike nahi chala sakti’. Part of the India Bike Week, held in Goa recently, the 23-year old talks to us about how she came to be one of the toughest lady bike riders. How did you start biking and since when?When I was really young, my dad discovered I have a passion for motorcycling. At 5, he had seen me running towards the handlebar and that showed him I had this love for motorcycles. Later, he taught me how to ride a motorcycle. So I have been riding from a really young age, from the era where we had the gear shifting motorbikes with the help of my dad. Where all have you been and how did the scooty trips to Khardung La go?In 2015, this two-wheeler manufacturing company was looking for a person who could do this and no one turned up. So they approached me since I was a known stunt rider. They had the confidence in me and it was testing the waters for them as it had never been done before. For me personally, it was exploring my skills as riding the scooter at that height is not easy given the altitude, oxygen levels and there were no roads. It was like riding on an edge. It was dangerous but thrilling. I started from Jammu and went to Kargil, Srinagar and Leh and then went to Khardung La which is the highest motorable road in the world. From Khardung La I went to Pangong Lake to the Indo-China border. So I did 2150 kms in 18 days. Anam Hashim (BCCL/ @anamhashim21) Anam Hashim (BCCL/ @anamhashim21) How did you make your parents agree to let you go on this trip?My story is a little different. My journey started way back when I started riding professionally. I was in Pune, studying and they (her parents) told me to come back to Lucknow as they were worried about my safety. They asked me to come back to Lucknow or they would stop paying for my education. They thought I was living like a gangster and they told me I was not in good company. They tried everything in the book that there can be to make me come back. My parents are divorced and my mom’s second husband takes care of our family and he was a bit dominating and he used to pressurize my mom to make me come back. My mom asked me to come back with my bike to Lucknow and she would support me to continue my biking in Lucknow but I knew that was not the truth. Since then I have been disconnected from my family and have been living independently. From biking to stunts and then also winning an international competition. How’s the journey been and how did it all materialize?I wanted to go for stunt competitions as it is legal and known as a sport outside India. Like Moto GP, Stunt GP is also a thing but the sad part is not many people know about it. I wanted to go out and have that kind of exposure but my finances were not working out. So I became the brand ambassador of a scooter brand for a year to work my finances out. Then I went to Indonesia and people were very helpful there. Not a lot of women were riding there as well. However, things were much better and everyone was very friendly in the riding fraternity there. I fulfilled my dream of participating in an international stunt competition. I stayed there for two months and participated in two more stunt competitions. In the first competition, there were women but then in the second there was only me and one more woman and the rest were boys. This makes me the only Indian to have gone international and participated in a stunt competition. Anam Hashim (BCCL) Anam Hashim (BCCL) Having said that, I am saddened at the state of affairs of the stunts fraternity here in India. Firstly, people do not treat it as a sport but they see it as entertainment. I used to perform stunt shows but now I have stopped doing it as I do not want to promote it as a form of entertainment but as a sport. In April 2019 I completed building my bike built from spare parts used from the things given to me by my sponsors. I participated in India's toughest racing competition – the Desert Storm. There are women from India who have been trying to attempt to complete the ride but in vain. Aishwarya Pissay, however, finished it in her third attempt, but me being an individual rider. finished it in one go. It won me the sportsmanship award at Desert Storm and I count this as a very big accomplishment. What's your ultimate goal?My goal is riding internationally. In India we do not take it as a sport though I am doing my best to promote stunt riding as a sport, there has to be a community and an organization that my sport is lacking. I haven’t stopped stunting because that is what has made me what I am today and it is a part of my training but I have moved to cross country valley racing and that is where I aim to go international and make it to World Cup level. What memories do you have of Lucknow?I studied in Lucknow Public School. I was an average student not really academically inclined but more towards extracurricular activities. When I was in 10th grade, my father promised to gift me a motorcycle if I scored a good percentage in my boards. I put in everything I had and got 68% in my boards but I got a two-wheeler as a gift as my mom asked my father to not get me a bike as it is not for girls. However, I stayed rigid and I protested for days post which my parents had to bow down and my father went back to the showroom and got me a bike and that is my first motorcycle. My school had kurta-pyjama and dupatta as a dress code and I used to ride a bike wearing that uniform along with gloves and helmet so it was quite intriguing to a lot of people. People also made fun but I couldn't care less. I was pretty famous in school and all the guys used to tell me to give them rides and we used to exchange bikes. My own principal once came to me and told me to perform a wheelie which I refused as it was not a good example to set and I was appreciated by my principal for the same. Do you visit the city often?I do visit Lucknow as I have a younger brother. I do not come back without having Tunday Kebab and Kulche Nihari at Chowk. I never ever come back without that. Please tell us a bit about this latest venture that you were part of and how do you feel about it. When I was learning how to stunt, I had gotten an invite from India Bike Week. This was in 2014. I went back again in 2015 and I remember they had organised stunt competitions and I had participated in it. A lot of people from across the country had come down and I met a lot of people from the biking fraternity all present at India Bike Week and it was quite an exhilarating experience for me and I went back again this year and I couldn’t be happier. Do you feel there’s a lack of adventure sports for women in India?I don't think there is a lack of adventure sports for women in India but I believe there is a lack of awareness which is the main issue. I believe women should go out and just do it. There were a lot of women who started stunting with me but stopped midway. I believe you need to have a drive and dedication towards your passion. Does the typical male attitude come into play in women faring well in adventure sports? Have you faced discrimination for being a girl venturing into the male territory? I have faced a lot of discrimination and it continues till date. I started stunt riding with bikes and everyone was very happy for me. They were genuinely happy. However, I started getting a lot of endorsements and brands were approaching me, my followers were increasing and that didn't go down well with a lot of men I was riding with. I started hearing things like ‘you don’t have the skills that we have and still you are receiving all this adulation’ and I tried reasoning with them that since I am the only woman who is doing this, it makes a difference. People who were my supporters turned into my bullies and it really hurt me and my mental health was affected. I then cut ties with all of them. Even now on social media as well there are a lot of men who troll me as I am a biker and I wear clothing that I like and that doesn’t go down well with a lot of them. However, I have learned to look past it all and continue dancing to my own tune. "

UP DGP O P Singh reiterated that police had not fired a single bullet even as several of the deceased and injured, including cops, had gunshot injuries. Stray incidents of violence were also reported from Vadodara and Jabalpur, even as the ongoing protests in the rest of the country grew stronger, spread to newer areas and were largely peaceful. Authorities in many cities and districts imposed internet curfew and clamped prohibitory orders. CAA protests: Bijnor, Kanpur, Kashi, fire spreadsIn UP, internet was snapped in 21 districts, including Varanasi and Lucknow.

At least three policemen, including an assistant commissioner of police, were injured while three police vehicles were damaged. Vadodara police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut said the trouble started when some people objected to a police videographer shooting the crowd that was coming out of Hathikhana Panch Muslim Masjid after the Friday namaz. Mangaluru, which was put under curfew after witnessing two deaths on Thursday in police firing, remained largely peaceful on Friday. Curfew in the city will remain till the midnight of Sunday.

Several police vehicles were vandalised or torched in Amroha, Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Hapur while self-imposed curfew could be witnessed in many cities as shopkeepers kept their shutters down. The UP government has ordered closure of all schools, colleges and universities on Saturday. Schools were already closed on Thursday and Friday due to extreme cold weather. Prohibitory orders are in place in the entire state. Senior officials said internet services will be restored by respective authorities in the 21 districts only after a review of the situation on Saturday evening. These districts are Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Agra, Aligarh, Ghaziabad, Varanasi, Mathura, Meerut, Moradabad, Muzaffarnagar, Bareilly, Firozadad, Pilibhit, Rampur, Saharanpur, Shamli, Sambhal, Amroha, Mau and Azamgarh. Stone pelting in Meerut continued for hours during the day and intensified despite paramilitary forces rushing to the affected areas to push back the rioters. In the evening, the retreating mob attacked Islamabad police outpost and torched several vehicles kept there. SSP Meerut Ajay Sahni said 12 people have been arrested for the arson and additional police force has been deployed at all sensitive spots. In Varanasi, at least eight people, including a 10-year-old boy, were injured in a stampede after police lathicharged protesters in retaliation of heavy stone pelting. SSP Varanasi Prabhakar Chaudhary said the boy is on life support. In Madhya Pradesh’s Jabalpur, curfew was imposed in four police station areas after protests turned violent when thousands defied prohibitory orders and attacked cops. At least 13 cops were injured in the brick-batting. In Bhopal, too, about 10,000 people defied Section 144, but the protest was peaceful. Schools will remain shut in the two cities on Saturday. In Gujarat, heavy stone pelting and vandalism broke out in Vadodara’s Hathikhana area, forcing the police to fire two rounds in the air and lob 30 tear gas shells to disperse a rampaging mob. At least three policemen, including an assistant commissioner of police, were injured while three police vehicles were damaged. Vadodara police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut said the trouble started when some people objected to a police videographer shooting the crowd that was coming out of Hathikhana Panch Muslim Masjid after the Friday namaz. Mangaluru, which was put under curfew after witnessing two deaths on Thursday in police firing, remained largely peaceful on Friday. Curfew in the city will remain till the midnight of Sunday. Internet remains snapped in the city. Protests against CAA spread to different parts of Maharashtra on Friday, with nearly one lakh people turning up for a rally outside the Aurangabad district collectorate. While this rally was peaceful, police had to resort to lathicharge in Beed and Parbhani. In Pune, more than 12,000 people walked in a peaceful rally while 2,000 protesters gathered at Ambedkar Chowk in Pimpri. In Kolhapur, where police have already issued prohibitory orders from Thursday, around 100 people organised a protest at the Kolhapur district collectorate. Read this story in Bengali"
Lucknow,Bundelkhand suffered as previous governments made money in its name: CM Yogi Adityanath,"LUCKNOW: In a veiled attack on the previous SP and BSP governments, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said that the rights of people of Bundelkhand region were attacked in the name of development before BJP came to power. Speaking at a function organised to facilitate the farmers of Bundelkhand region, Yogi said people in power made money in the name of development while the actual residents were deprived of their rights. “When there is a government with a negative approach, rights of people are attacked. And that exactly had been happening previously,” he told a gathering of farmers, who had given their land for the construction of 296km expressway, the foundation of which is expected to be laid by PM Narendra Modi next month. Yogi announced that the expressway would be opened for public use by the end of next year. “Timely completion of the expressway along with ensuring its good quality is at the top of the agenda,” he said. “The Bundelkhand expressway will become the lifeline of the region, which has been deprived of development since Independence,” Yogi said, adding that the proposed defence corridor along the expressway would arrest the flight of youth from the region in search of jobs. Yogi said the state government has already acquired almost 95% of the land for the expressway, which is estimated to come up at a cost of around Rs 15,000 crore. “There is no alternative to development. The future generation will have to imbibe development,” he said. The CM said the state government was committed to providing infrastructural facilities, including drinking water, to households in seven districts of Bundelkhand. “The project will be executed in the next two years,” he said. “Bundelkhand will not be called backward in the next three years,” Yogi said. Chitrakoot, he said, would be developed as a spiritual centre. Even the office of Bundelkhand development board will be developed, he added. "

Lucknow,Mayawati tells BSP cadre that CAA stir should be peaceful,"LUCKNOW: Amidst protests raging in the country against the new citizenship law, BSP chief Mayawati on Friday distanced herself from the violence and said while she opposed the law, people should hold peaceful protests. Stating that BSP was a disciplined party which believed in law, Mayawati said it fights for rights of marginalized in a peaceful way and within the ambit of law. “BSP supports protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which the Centre is trying to force upon the people. I appeal to party workers to not hit the streets like workers of other parties, but lodge protests by writing to the chief minister, district magistrates and governors,” she said. The former UP chief minister said her party opposed the law from the beginning as it was divisive and unconstitutional. To lodge protests and demand rollback, the party met President Ram Nath Kovind last week. “I have personally spoken against this law on social media through messages and I condemn violence and deaths. However, I request people to protest peacefully,” she said. "
Lucknow,Do not oppose NRC till it is imposed pan-India: Shia cleric,"LUCKNOW: Shia cleric and Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind general secretary Maulana Kalbe Jawad on Friday urged the Shia community to exercise restraint and not oppose the National Register of Citizens (NRC) as it has been implemented only in Assam for now. However, the cleric said if NRC is implemented nationwide then Shias should resort to civil disobedience by refusing to provide any proof of citizenship. Addressing Shia Muslims at Asafi Mosque in Bada Imambara before Friday prayers, Jawad, who is also Imam-E-Juma of Lucknow, said, “There is no need to take to streets and protest against the NRC act as it has been applied only in Assam. However, if it is imposed in the whole country, we should resort to civil disobedience and decline to give any proof or required documents to the government for proving that we are Indians.” Jawad in his 8-minute address said that more than 20 crore Muslims live in India and if all of them resort to civil disobedience, it will make a huge impact. “We will see how they (government) will take action against such a big population,” he said. Flaying Muslim politicians for being silent over police action on protesters in Lucknow, the cleric said, “A person got killed, more than 50 were arrested and scores of innocents were lathicharged but senior politicians like Azam Khan are silent,” he said.

Lucknow,15-year-old among 3 wrong people at 3 wrong places,"LUCKNOW: He was walking to his uncle’s house when he suddenly found himself in the middle of a pitched battle between protesters and police near the clock tower in Husainabad on Thursday. Before the Class VIII student could take cover, he felt a shooting pain in the back and fainted. When the 15-year-old finally opened his eyes, he was at KGMU Trauma Centre where doctors said he had suffered a gunshot injury. “I live in Chaupatia in Chowk and my maternal uncle’s house is in Khadra. I was walking towards the pavement when I felt the pain and went dizzy. The next thing I know I am here,” he told TOI from his hospital bed on Friday. While the teenager couldn’t say for sure if the cop or someone else fired the bullet that hit him, his father who is a contractor lashed out at both police and protesters for not showing mercy to a minor boy. “My son is a student. He was not part of any demonstration. Why was he shot at?” the father asked. The schoolboy was among three persons who suffer gunshot wounds during Thursday’s violent protests. While 25-year-old Mohammad Wakil succumbed to his injuries during treatment, a young labourer too has been operated on like the student and is said to be recovering. A fourth victim of the clash who suffered critical head injuries in a stampede during the marathon protests and police retaliation is still on life support. Daily wage earner Shameem (18), a resident of Husainabad, was on his way home when he was shot at in the back in Thakurganj. The bullet perforated his body, but he kept walking for nearly 2km till he reached his house. “A portion of his intestines was protruding out of his abdomen when he came home. We pressed a cloth against his stomach (to prevent blood loss) and rushed him to hospital,” said sister Mahira Khatoon. “My brother was caught in the clash near Taqia Masjid around 4pm. He didn’t even get a chance to run to safety,” she added. Chikan garments wholesaler Waseen (55) was going to his brother Idris’s shop in Nazirabad when he was caught in the stampede near Baradari in Kaiserbagh following police baton charge and suffered grievous head injuries. “When he didn’t arrive at my shop as expected, we enquired at the police station and started looking for him in hospitals. We found him at the trauma centre,” said Idris. “My brother had no role whatsoever in the protests or violence and yet, his life hangs by a thread. If this is not gross mismanagement, what is?” Idris gave the city authorities a point to ponder. "

Lucknow,"CM Yogi Adityanath appeals for peace, says don’t heed rumours","LUCKNOW: With violent protests raging for the second day on Friday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath appealed to people to not fall for rumours and be misled on the new citizenship law. “It’s the responsibility of the Uttar Pradesh government to provide security to all citizens,” the CM said, appealing for peace. In all at least 11 people died during protests in the state since Thursday. The chief minister said: “People should not heed rumours or be incited by mischievous elements. The Prime Minister has clarified CAA is not against any community, caste or religion, but guarantees security to all citizens. This kind of violence is in defiance of the law of the land.” He said anti-social and anti-national elements who do not want peace in country were behind the violence. As the fire spread to more districts on Friday, the chief minister directed police to identify people who were fuelling rumours on CAA and indulging in violence. He reiterated the government will identify rioters from video footage and confiscate their assets to compensate for destruction of public property. Hours after Congress released a video of its president Sonia Gandhi rejecting the CAA and condemning the police action against protesters, Yogi Adityanath called the speeches by Congress and SP leaders as “unfortunate”. He accused them of repeatedly misleading people on the new citizenship law for what he described as “their narrow political gains”. "
Lucknow,4 get death for 2008 Jaipur serial blasts,"JAIPUR: All four men convicted of being involved in the 2008 Jaipur serial bomb blasts that had left 80 dead and 170 injured were awarded the death penalty by a special court here on Friday. Special court judge Ajay Kumar Sharma also imposed a penalty of over Rs 8 lakh on each of the convicts — Mohammad Saif, Mohammad Sarwar Azmi, Mohammad Salman and Saifur Rehman. Another accused, Shahbaz Ahmed, was acquitted on Wednesday after the court gave him the benefit of doubt. Apart from these five, two accused were killed in the Batla House encounter in Delhi and five others are still absconding. Shahbaz, a resident of Lucknow, was accused of sending emails to police claiming responsibility for the blasts on behalf of the banned Indian Mujahideen. However, the charge could not be established. While main accused Mohammad Saif was convicted of planting explosives at Manak Chowk, Mohammad Sarwar was held responsible for planting bomb at Chandpole Hanuman Temple. Mohammad Salman was found responsible for planting a bomb at Sanganeri Gate Hanuman Temple and Saifur Rahman for orchestrating the blast at Phool Walon ka Khande at Choti Chaupar. Considering their age at the time of the incident, the defence had argued against the death penalty. However, the court said, “We had to weigh the seriousness of the crime with their age. Innocent people were killed and injured. They had perpetrated a terrorist act. The accused had no personal enmity with those who had fallen victims to their act.” “The accused were proved to be members of the Indian Mujahideen and the accused perpetrated the crime in the guise of jihad. Mass killing of innocent people, spreading terror is despicable, cruel and an anti-social activity. The action of the accused was a pre-meditated act directed against the state,” the court added. Following the Jaipur blasts, similar heinous crimes were perpetrated in Ahmedabad and Delhi, the court said, adding the case comes under the “rarest of rare” category and does not deserve any leniency in punishment. The court said if the victims’ families had not been given adequate compensation, they will be entitled to solatium under the victims’ compensation scheme. If the state government had provided any compensation to the kith and kin of the victims, it will be added to the compensation scheme. "
Lucknow,Two get life term for 2007 UP court blast,"FAIZABAD: A special court in Faizabad on Friday awarded life imprisonment to two accused in connection with Faizabad civil court blast in which five people were killed and 24 injured. The UP court also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 each on the convicts, and acquitted one accused for want of evidence.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad internet curbs on till 10am today,"GHAZIABAD: Protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act snowballed into clashes in at least three areas of Ghaziabad on Friday, prompting the district administration to extend the clampdown on internet till 10am on Saturday. All educational institutions in the state will remain closed on Saturday, officials said. Though sporadic incidents of violence were reported from several areas of the district, agitations took a massive turn in Kaila Bhatta area of Kotwali, Sahibabad and Muradnagar. According to police records, around 8,000 people had come out on the streets in Kaila Bhatta, while the number of protesters in Sahibabad and Muradnagar were 6,000 and 5,000, respectively. However, the protests remained restricted to the colonies itself and did not spill on to the main roads, sparing daytime traffic. Of the three areas, the agitation in Kaila Bhatta threatened to spin out of control at one point. It started around 1.30pm, after the Friday prayers. Police said when they tried to pacify the protesters, a few residents of the area pelted the cops with stones from their roofs. Stones and brickbats rained on the police team for about 10 minutes, during which four cops suffered injuries. Those injured were Satendra Singh, the SHO of Kotwali police station, sub-inspector Dinesh Prakash Singh, and constables Ravi and Mahipal. A flying brick hurled by one of the protesters hit Mahipal in the head. A few protesters were also injured as the cops resorted to lathi-charge. SP (city) Manish Kumar Mishra said more than 8,000 people had come out on the streets from areas adjoining Kaila Bhatta, holding aloft banners against the CAA. “There are five mosques in Kaila Bhatta area. After offering Friday prayers, a large number of people gathered on the road and joined protesters from neighbouring areas. A police team was attacked with stones when it tried to stop the agitators,” Mishra added. Stray bricks hit a few passersby too. Saleem, a resident of Kaila Bhatta who was hit by a stone, said he was never a part of the protest. “I came out the mosque around 1.30am. When I reached the PAC Chowk, I saw a number of people protesting and shouting slogans. Suddenly, a piece of brick thrown by someone from the roof hit me on the head,” he added. The situation in Sahibabad and Muradnagar were equally bad. Anil Shahi, the SHO of Sahibabad police station, said a few officers in his team were injured too. “There were over 6,000 people on the road. They started throwing stones at us. Seven police officers were hit. They included sub-inspector Sanjeev Sharma, who suffered a fracture in the left hand, and circle officer Rakesh Kumar Mishra,” he added. In Muradnagar, three cops were hit by stones. They were OP Singh, the SHO of the local police station, sub-inspector Yogendra Tyagi and constable Surendra Yadav. “Despite Section 144, people came out on the streets in large numbers. When we tried to stop them from marching ahead, they hurled stones at us. Resorting to lathi-charge was the last option. The situation was brought under control by 6pm,” said SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun. On Friday evening, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said it was because of the violence on Friday that the decision to extend the internet curbs was taken. “On Thursday evening, we had ordered an internet shutdown for 24 hours starting from 10pm on Thursday. But due the violence, we have decided to extend the clampdown till 10 am Saturday,” Pandey said. The district magistrate added a call would be taken on Saturday morning whether to restore Net services. Through the day, a total of 60 people was arrested for creating a ruckus. Ghaziabad police chief Sudhir Kumar Singh said over 5,000 cops had been deployed across the district to control the situation. “We had an intelligence report that people will hold protests. We apprehended that some of the agitations could turn violent. That is why so many cops were deployed in sensitive areas,” Singh said. Police have identified 58 sensitive areas across the district.

Kanpur,"8-year-old trampled in Varanasi, dies in hospital","VARANASI/KANPUR: An 8- year-old boy gleefully playing with his friend in the bylanes of Varanasi was trampled in the stampede that followed a police lathicharge on protesters in Dharara locality of the city on Friday. The boy, Mohammed Sageer, succumbed to injuries in a city hospital late evening. The child was left choking and unconscious after crowds chased by police ran over him and by the time he was picked up from the debris of brickbats and rushed to hospital, he was very critical. “When people rushed into the bylane, Sageer was caught in the stampede. Another 15-year-old boy playing with him is battling for life in hospital,” said a senior police officer. The Varanasi DM said he will write to the government for ex gratia relief to the boy’s family. "
Ghaziabad,4G To No Ji: Ghaziabad paralysed without internet,"GHAZIABAD: Cut off from the digital ecosystem around which daily life revolves, lakhs of people in NCR — Ghaziabad and Meerut, to speak of Delhi’s immediate neighbourhood — were left marooned by the UP government’s internet shutdown. If data is the new oxygen, this was complete digital asphyxiation: there was no access to basic needs like cabs, netbanking and mobile wallets as well as other widely used net services like e-commerce, online groceries, food delivery and music and TV streaming. Local businesses were disrupted, banks and hospitals handicapped, and daily schedules of people went haywire. Only in Ghaziabad and Meerut, which were among the 21 UP districts where internet was suspended, nearly 1 crore people were affected. The unprecedented blackout, which the government said was necessary to stop “rumour-mongering” about the Citizenship Amendment Act, drew strong reactions from residents, who questioned the logic of a blanket shutdown of what has become a basic need, particularly in an urban centre like Ghaziabad which leads the digital lifestyle. Payal Tripathi, an entrepreneur and a resident of Paramount Symphony in Crossings Republik, said, “We have been completely cut off from the rest of the world. I could not do any work on Friday. After getting stuck in the massive traffic jam on Thursday due to protests, I had decided to work from home on Friday, but suddenly came to know about this internet shutdown.” When Tripathi discovered she could not access emails, she drove to neighbouring Noida where internet services were normal, parked her car on the roadside and got to work. In the highly urbanised trans-Hindon areas like Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara, residents said the administration should not have shut down broadband internet (home WiFi) services because the majority of internet users access web from the mobile, and a mobile internet suspension would have sufficed. Sumi Shukla, a teacher based in Vasundhara, said, “I had to go to hospital for a medical checkup but couldn’t book a cab. I walked for a long distance before getting into an auto. What if it was midnight? What if some untoward incident were to happen? Who would have been responsible for that?” asked the 28-year-old. “I felt helpless without the internet. I don’t want to drive to work because I have no idea of traffic diversions, I can't book a cab, nor can I check for updates on metro closures,” said Samarth Gurung, a media professional who lives in Indirapuram. It wasn’t just those living there; people headed for Ghaziabad also had a tough time as Uber and Ola drivers turned down bookings because they would not be able to end their trips or access GPS in Ghaziabad. An Uber driver in Noida said he had to refuse two passengers headed for Ghaziabad. “Without internet, I cannot also get any trip from there,” he said. Was it indeed a blanket ban?The shutdown came into effect from 10pm on December 19 (Thursday) but some residents in Indirapuram said mobile internet was available on their phones till Friday morning. Some local broadband service providers, and a leading company, continued with WiFi services as usual. But another company completely switched off both its mobile internet and high-speed broadband service. In areas like Crossings Republik, Indirapuram and Vaishali, which are on the Noida and Delhi borders, there were several localities where people across the main road/highway (with Noida or Delhi as their addresses) had internet. Crossings Republik suddenly discovered an internet hotspot — housing societies in the township located near Shahberi, which is a part of Greater Noida, had internet while others did not, leading to some confusion about the ban. In a sarcastic tweet, Sunjeet Malik, a resident, wrote: “In Ghaziabad, crossing republic people are again cheated by the government. Still the internet is working fine. Don’t do such discrimination with us (sic).” A crisis for manyResidents of several condominiums were unable to pay prepaid meter bills because of the unavailability of internet, leading to power blackouts. RWAs came to their rescue and agreed to provide power supply till net services are restored. Alok Kumar, founder of the Federation of Apartment Owners Association (FedAOA), said, “Hundreds of residents living in highrise apartments rushed to maintenance offices to enquire about making payments for their pre-paid meters. The system is such that as soon as the entire amount is consumed, the electricity supply is stopped. AOAs are trying to provide temporary supply to them.” Kumar, however, cautioned that this temporary service can last just one or two days. “It is not possible to continue this for a long time as it costs a lot,” he added. Some missed their EMI date. “The internet shutdown caught me unawares. I had to make an online EMI payment, which I do on the 20th of every month. Now that I can’t do it, I want to know who will pay the fine,” said Ashish Kumar, who lives in a Supertech society in Indirapuram. “If this continues on Saturday, I’ll have to go to Delhi to make the transactions,” he added. Vaishali resident Arvind Kumar pointed out the irony of an internet shutdown by the same government that has been asking people to go cashless. “Ever since the government promoted cashless transactions, I have gotten into the habit of using Paytm. On Friday, I had to rush back home to get cash,” he said. Online food services were among the worst hit. A counter manager with a popular food delivery app in in Ghaziabad said the company receives around 10,000 orders a day from Ghaziabad, but on Friday, business was down to around 10-15% of that. Shilpi Mathur, 39, a homemaker, said she had never experienced anything like this before and since all her gadgets were WiFi-dependent, she was cut off. “I can’t watch news on my TV and social media is not accessible,” said the resident of Rajendra Nagar in Sahibabad. Concerns were voiced by the student community too. Rakesh Mehta tweeted, “I’m a student and every day I have eight hours online class. How can I can I study in Ghaziabad. PLz answer (sic)’ The question was directed to Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey. Another resident, Disha, tweeted: “Internet has been shut down in Ghaziabad, how will we live-tweet our wedding?” "
Lucknow,Ab flashy concepts ka charm nahi hai films mein: Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari,"The Bareilly Ki Barfi director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari recently visited Lucknow, which she says is the closest city to her heart. The Nil Battey Sannata director was in the city to speak at an event. Even though Ashwiny was tired when we caught up with her, moments after she landed in the city Ashwiny was excited to be in her favourite city and took time out to talk to speak to us over a cuppa. Ashwiny spoke at length about shooting in Lucknow, how the city is making the most of recent shoots here, women directors in Bollywood, how small town stories are making it big in Bollywood. You seem to be quite excited about coming back to Lucknow?Well, yes! It is nice to comeback to Lucknow. I shot Nil Batey Sannata in UP in which I had a lot of my cast who was from Lucknow. And then Bareilly Ki Barfi was shot in Lucknow which was in 2016. Lucknow has changed a lot since then. In terms of shooting, things were not that settled in Lucknow at that time. In fact, I had myself decided ki how will we be doing the setup and all of the shoot? I remember going to houses and asking for stuff for shooting purpose with a promise of returning them after the shoot. Now Lucknow has become a mini film unit. So many films are being made in Lucknow, so many actors are shooting here. There is so much of good local talent in Lucknow whom I had used in my film.I mean Lucknow has so many line producers, casting directors, and we have people renting out vanity vans in the city. But when I was shooting, vanity vans used to come from Delhi. So there is this whole income generating industry that has been set up in Lucknow. We even used to get caterers from Mumbai to cook for us. But now we have so many local caterers providing good food for the film crew. Isn’t it nice? I also came to know that the place where we shot Bareily Ki Barfi is now called Bitty house, which was Kirti Sanon's reel name in the film. Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)  Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Small town stories seem to be the current flavour of Bollywood...Films are a reflection of society. Jaise economy badhti hai, jaise log badhte hain apne setups mein, waise hi income generation bhi hoti hai, aur hamare wishes bhi zyada ho jati hain. Hamare parents ki generation ka yahi agenda tha ki yeh hai hamare paas and we will make the children study and then they will go to a metro city or abroad. So going abroad or to a metro city used to be a big thing for people from smaller towns. But the roots were still where they were born. That time going to a mall was like ‘wow’. Ab malls and brands are everywhere. Toh ab maza nahi hai. Ab flashy concepts ka charm nahi hai films mein. Now films are also rooted as is the society. Ab aspirations have changed. Now our aspiration is ab sab kuchh mil gaya hai and now we want to be back to our roots. You see most girls like to dress up in ethnic wear on festivals and be with their family. So have you seen any flashy film of late?I have this thing that I avoid watching any film when I am in the post production of my film. Woh hota hai na jab aap entrance exam dete ho so you only concentrate on that. For me now my upcoming film Panga is the entrance exam jo mujhe pass karna hai. How easy or difficult it is for a women to be a filmmaker? Is Bollywood still a man’s world when it comes to filmmaking, as we still do not have many women directors. I don’t think so! If you see there are so many female assistant directors. But all of them can’t become directors over night. There is a journey of becoming a director from an assistant director. Ek maturity aati hai with time. My journey has been different as I was already working in advertising and media for 16 years. So shifting to films was just another area. But the back end work was not difficult. What was difficult for me was to explain to a line producer in Agra that I am the director of the film and this is what he needs to do. He didn’t understand ki yeh kya ho raha hai. That line producer used to call me ‘sir’ for some strange reason. Filmmaking as a job or a career was always on the dark side in the sense it is Bollywood, late night shoots, all that. But now filmmaking has become a career; there are courses available for it. Jab courses hote hain jo ki government approved hote hain toh it becomes a career option. Jab aap apne parents ko bologey toh you need to have a legitimate course for it. Now we have several courses to become director. Ashwiny &amp; Kriti Sanon shooting a scene of Bareilly Ki Barfi in Lucknow (BCCL/ @ashwinyiyertiwari) Ashwiny &amp; Kriti Sanon shooting a scene of Bareilly Ki Barfi in Lucknow (BCCL/ @ashwinyiyertiwari) What perspective can a women director bring in a film which a man can not and vice-versa?A story can come out from anywhere, but there will always be a sentimental divide on how a male looks at something and how a female looks at it. And the difference is that for example, women as a psyche are more intuitive and emotional, we have this very caring nature. That way the gender is different. Like Kangana told me how easy it is to talk to me, as in she says she doesn’t have to think twice before talking to me. The same thing even Kriti told me. Ayushmann, I remember while shooting, was in a foul mood once. I thought something must have happened at his home as not every day is the same for us. I saw through the camera that his mood is off. So I took him in a corner and asked him ‘kya hua’. He asked me how did I come to know that something was wrong. It is because as women, we are very inclusive and sensitive. Women directors will always have an upper hand of that extra warmth in filmmaking. "

Lucknow,"Cabs to food, e-biz hit by internet shutdown","NEW DELHI: India’s internetbased economy is feeling the pinch of the first major national disruption in connectivity following protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The impact is most pronounced in UP and NCR, where the consumer base is quite large for most online service providers. As many as 24 UP districts, including Ghaziabad, and parts of Delhi have seen internet shutdowns over the past week. Food delivery apps have seen volumes dip by 10-20% in these areas even as supply chain disruption has impacted online retail and e-grocery businesses. Ride-hailing services have stopped working too in the shutdown-hit areas. Most of these startups that rely on the internet for everything have been caught unawares. “We are not prepared for this contingency,” said the founder of a logistics startup. We’ve seen a 10-20% impact on our biz, says biryani chainIndustry pundits say North India, which has seen the most protests, accounts for about 30-40% of e-tail logistics deliveries, making it the largest market. Residents of Ghaziabad, where internet was shut down from Thursday night, struggled to book cab rides with Uber and Ola. Drivers were also refusing trips from Delhi to Ghaziabad because of this. Some drivers also stayed off the road on Thursday and Friday, fearing violence and damage to their vehicles. TOI reached out to Uber and Ola for a reaction. The Uber spokesperson didn’t respond to messages while the Ola spokesperson declined to comment. Online food deliveries were also massively hit. Food delivery apps like Zomato, Swiggy and UberEats together handle 2-2.5 million orders daily. UP accounts for up to 60,000 of their orders.

He said that in places where there is an internet shutdown, the company is trying to route customer queries to its call centre. Orders are piling up for grocery delivery companies too.

Kanpur,UP simmers: Crackdown fails to cap violence against CAA,"KANPUR: The industrial city was rocked by fresh violence on Saturday, a day after two people died of gunshot wounds during protests against the new citizenship law at Babupurwa. Several people were injured in Saturday’s violent protests at Yateemkhana area, where two policemen suffered gun-shot injuries and were being treated in Lala Lajpat Rai hospital. The area remained under siege for three hours during which vehicles inside a police outpost were torched. ADG (Zone) Prem Prakash said three policemen suffered bullet injuries in the violence. “Rioters hurled petrol bombs and opened indiscriminate firing, leaving three policemen injured. Among the three injured is sub-inspector Prabal Pratap, who sustained gunshot wounds. Besides, Arpit, a constable, sustained gun-shot wounds on his chin and one other police officer suffered head injuries.” Three FIRs were lodged at separate polices stations and 10 rioters have been arrested, he said. Two persons, who suffered bullet injuries on Friday at Babupurwa, succumbed to injuries in hospital. Their bodies were shifted to mortuary for autopsy where a massive police force and crowds were present. The administration decided to take the bodies directly to the cemetery, but later decided to hand them over to family members. Earlier, Samajwadi Party MLAs Amitabh Bajpai and Irfan Solanki, former MLAs Munindra Shukla and Lal Singh Tomar and some other party leaders met the district magistrate at his camp office and demanded an inquiry into administrative lapse. They also demanded that culprits be punished, but innocent people should not be harassed. The SP leaders thereafter reached the morgue and met family members of the deceased. Soon, sparks began flying between ADG Prem Prakash and Amitabh Bajpai and then the MLA was taken into custody. Earlier, the city erupted again and protesters fought pitched battles with police at Yateemkhana area of Bankerganj locality where six vehicles — four four-wheelers and two two-wheelers — parked by the side of Yateemkhana police outpost, were torched amidst heavy brickbatting. Protests were triggered off around 3 pm, when police handed over bodies of the two killed in Babupurwa violence to their families. Aftab, 23, and Saif, 22, died during protests late Friday. Police said hundreds of people demanding immediate release of protesters during protests and disbursement of Rs 50 lakh compensation to families of those killed hit the roads in Yateemkhana and the situation remained tense all day long. Protesters fought pitched battles with police attacking them with country-made firearms, bricks, stones, petrol bombs and bottles. Many among them took position from rooftops. The ADG said, “Crowds gathered in areas like Babupurwa, Nai Sadak, Moolganj, Dalelpurwa and Haleem College and police were deployed in large numbers to keep vigil.” "

Agitations in Sahibabad, Muradnagar and Kaila Bhatta area of Kotwali had assumed massive proportions when police tried to thwart an attempt of the demonstrators from getting on to the main roads. In these three areas, over 25 police officers, including a circle officer, three SHOs, five sub-inspector and as many as 15 constables, suffered severe injuries as residents hurled stones from rooftops. As internet facilities resumed in the district on Saturday morning, around 800 social media accounts came under the scanner of cyber police.

Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh: Man arrested for duping youths with fake jobs,"LUCKNOW: A man posing as an officer in state secretariat was on Saturday arrested for duping people on the pretext of getting them a government job. Police said the accused had defrauded at least two dozen people. Acting on the complaint of one of the victims, Mahesh, cops arrested Ritesh Kumar from Sector-14 crossing in Indiranagar. In his complaint to police, Mahesh claimed that Kumar took Rs 50,000 but did not help him getting a job. Circle officer, Ghazipur, Deepak Singh said Kumar used to put up advertisements for technical and nontechnical jobs in government departments on various social media platforms. “Those showing interest were asked to register for Rs 10,000 and then apply for job. Later, they were asked to pay Rs 30,000 for security and job surety.

Lucknow,Lucknow: All roads lead to Wi-Fi parks amid Net blackout,"LUCKNOW: As the mobile and broadband internet blackout continued on Saturday morning, people thronged city parks that offer free Wi-Fi services. Also, since BSNL is exempted from the outage, those with the PSU’s broadband connection at home were by default crowd magnets for friends and relatives. The Lucknow Municipal Corporation provides free Wi-Fi at Jhandi Wala Park in Lalbagh and Dayanidhan Park in Kaiserbagh, both of which saw unusually heavy footfall. Free internet at Hazratganj Metro station was a big draw too. “I am a freelancer and the internet forms the backbone of my career. So, I am here to tap into the free Metro station Wi-Fi,” said Prashant Singh in Hazratganj. Kushagra Saran was at Dayanidhan Park to browse through social media pages. “Logging in to my social media accounts after waking up is like a morning ritual. I am here to get a hang of what is going on in the virtual world,” he said. Arpit Juneja of Jankipuram Sector-C is among the few lucky ones with Wi-Fi at home. “I received seven phone calls from friends wanting to pay me a visit, as if I am the most popular dude in the circle. Having internet at home felt as good as winning a lottery,” he chuckled. Hosteller Sakshi Agnihotri called the internet outage unsettling. “I keep tabs on current affairs using my mobile data. It feels like I have suddenly been cast away on an island. Free Wi-Fi at parks is the only consolation,” she said. (With inputs from Akshata Mishra)"
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Ground fog debuts, temperature drops to 7.1°C","LUCKNOW: It was a bonechilling yet surreal Saturday in the city, which witnessed ground fog for the first time this winter and grappled with a minimum temperature of 7.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest so far this season. Early morning visibility dropped below 100 metre, but the fog cleared by 9am, making way for sunshine and helping in abatement of ‘cold day’ condition prevailing for the past four days. Moderate ground fog, which forms just above the Earth’s surface, is likely on Sunday as well. The minimum is expected to drop further while the maximum will rise. Monday and Tuesday will though witness cloudy skies with possibility of drizzle in some parts of the city. State Met director JP Gupta said the western disturbance that would hit the Himalayas on Monday would alter the wind pattern in the state. Moist and warm easterlies will replace the icy North Wind, leading to clouds on Monday-Tuesday. There are chances of light rain at a few places in east UP. The city must brace for sporadic drizzle. The daytime high on Saturday was 20.3 degrees against Friday’s 18.2, but the reading was still four degrees below normal. In Met parlance, maximum temperatures five or more degrees below normal lead to ‘cold day’ condition. The minimum temperature dropped to 7.1 degrees Celsius, two units below normal, in comparison to 7.6 degrees Celsius on Friday. Maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to be around 22 and 7 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Sunday. "
Lucknow,"Tattoo artist death was an accident, police conclude","LUCKNOW: Nine months after a tattoo artist mysteriously drowned in Chinhat’s Indira Canal, police have arrived at the conclusion that the 30-year-old met with an accident and was not murdered as claimed by his family. The final report in the Gurpreet Singh case has been sent to the legal wing of the police department for scrutiny, Chinhat SHO Sachin Singh said. Once the legal wing clears the report, it will be submitted in the trial court. “We recreated the crime scene with the help of forensic experts. It has been concluded that the victim accidentally drowned in the canal. The FSL report states that if someone falls from a height of around 14ft into a 12ft-deep canal in an inebriated state, it may be difficult for him/her to navigate in the water and surface without support,” SHO Singh said. Gurpreet, fondly known as Guppi by family and friends, died under mysterious circumstances on March 27. He was believed to have gone picnicking at the canal with two friends, Amrita and Sanket Agnihotri. Guppi’s family lodged a murder case against both. However, Sanket was let off because surveillance of his mobile phone suggested he was somewhere else at the time of the incident. Amrita remained a suspect and was routinely grilled. The SHO said despite questioning both Amrita and Sanket more than once, police had failed to discover a “concrete motive” that might have prompted a murder. “Now, the legal cell will cross-check every detail and then submit our report in court,” he added.

Drop in temperatures and fog will cause pollution parameters to deteriorate,” said Dhruvsen Singh, the director of LU’s air quality monitoring station. "

Lucknow,"Buoyed by growth, MSME sector seeks Rs 70,000 crore loans","Lucknow: The UP government has asked for Rs 70,000 crore loan from banks for the MSME sector in the state, which will include chief minister Yogi Adityanath's flagship ODOP programme. The MSME sector has registered a substantial increase in loans from Rs 29,782.46 crore in 2018 to Rs 40741.95 crore in September 2019.

Lucknow,"Social, women groups seek release of CAA protesters","LUCKNOW: Various social and women groups on Saturday shot off a memorandum to state principal secretary (Home) and UP director general of police (DGP), seeking release of the people who were ""illegally detained"" by the police during a protest against citizenship law in the state capital on Thursday.

Lucknow,"After CAA protests, UP government panel set up to seize property","LUCKNOW: Forty-eight hours after chief minister Yogi Adityanath said properties of those who indulged in violence would be confiscated and auctioned to pay for destruction of public property, the process was set rolling on Saturday with the Lucknow district magistrate setting up a four-member committee. The panel will assess damage to public and private properties in the state capital during violent protests against the citizenship law. The process will be replicated in other districts wracked by violence. While identification of rioters from CCTV footage has begun, 50 photographs of trouble-makers were pasted in street intersections in Gorakhpur with a ‘wanted’ message. A 2010 Allahabad high court order will form the basis for the rollout of the property seizure-and-auction procedure. Sources in the government said, there’s a legal process to be followed for people to claim compensation for property damage. “The committee will receive representations from those who suffered damages and will independently assess loss to public property. This is being done as per a High Court order of December 2, 2010, subsequent to which the UP government issued orders for acquiring property of vandals on January 8, 2011,” said a senior government official. The court order states that “damage to public property shall be assessed, the concerned department, local body, public corporation and owner of property shall file a claim for realisation of the amount from political parties/persons (who called for agitation/procession in which damage takes place)”. It adds if the person or persons against whom the claim is filed were responsible for loss, “the amount assessed and awarded by such competent authority shall be realized as land revenue arrears, if not paid on its own by the person responsible within the deadline”. Saturday’s order issued by district magistrate Abhishek Prakash names additional DM East, ADM West, ADM Trans Gomti and ADM administration (rural) as part of the four-member committee. On Thursday, violence broke out in at least two places in Lucknow — Parivartan Chowk and Thakurganj — during which several vehicles were torched. A government official said that chief minister Yogi Adityanath was in no mood to spare the accused. In an appeal to citizens on Friday, the CM "

Kanpur,"‘SIMI-affiliate’ PFI role under probe, says UP deputy CM","LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Dinesh Sharma on Sunday said the government is probing the alleged role of Islamic fundamentalist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) in violence in the state during anti-CAA protests last week even as UP DGP O P Singh said a total of 879 people have been arrested and 5,000 ‘bound down’ (detained) so far as a preventive measure. Describing PFI as an affiliated group of the banned SIMI, Sharma said: “Popular Front of India, jo SIMI ka chhota sangathan hai, uski sanliptata dekhi ja rahi hai (We are seeing the involvement of PFI, which is a smaller version of SIMI).” He also blamed ‘outsiders’ who had ‘infiltrated’ protesters’ ranks for arson and said six people from Bengal’s Malda district were arrested. Provocative pamphlets in Bengali were seized from Lucknow’s Old City area, he added.

Net services restored in Aligarh and VaranasiUP DGP OP Singh said 879 people have been arrested under substantive offences while 5,000 others “who may instigate violence or vitiate atmosphere are bound down on the basis of suspicion”. “A total of 135 criminal cases have been registered against the miscreants,” Singh said, adding that 288 police personnel have been injured. The situation in the districts in UP which witnessed violence last week remained peaceful on Sunday. Heavy police force was deployed in parts of Kanpur, including Babupurwa and Yateemkhana that had seen violence, even as shops remained shut. Internet services were restored in Aligarh and Varanasi.

Lucknow,Mira Nair tweets for release of actor held for protesting in UP,"LUCKNOW: “This is our India now — Appalling: Our #SuitableBoy actress, Sadaf Jafar, beaten and jailed for peaceful protest in Lucknow! Join me in demanding her release,” Indian-American filmmaker Mira Nair on Sunday tweeted in support of the only woman arrested during protests against the new citizenship law in Lucknow on Thursday. According to Sadaf’s sister Naheed Varma, the activist and actress had participated in the protests at Parivartan Chowk. “She did several live sessions on Facebook. Suddenly, she went missing and we kept searching for her at one police station after the other. Later, Sadaf was shown as arrested,” she had told TOI on Friday. In the last two videos posted by Jafar on Facebook, she is heard condemning the violence that interrupted the protest she had been part of. She calls the perpetrators “goondas (miscreants)” and is also heard stopping students from venturing near the site where violence had broken out and questioning why the police were not taking action. In her last video, she is seen trying to reach where her car was parked. She is stopped midway and can be heard saying, “Why are you arresting me?” Educationist Amrita Dass, who has been associated with Sadaf for over a decade, expressed shock at her arrest. “I have been Sadaf’s counsellor. She is peace-loving and law-abiding. Her arrest is unjustified; she was protesting peacefully,” she said. On Saturday, various social and women’s groups submitted a memorandum to the principal secretary (home) and the DGP, seeking release of all those “illegally detained” during the protests on Thursday. The memorandum mentions Sadaf as one of those who were picked up. Signed by 38 people, including artists, activists, academicians and students, the memorandum states that those who were detained had appealed to people to maintain peace. “We have sufficient evidence against Sadaf Jafar. Allegations of police atrocities are incorrect,” he said. "
Kanpur,Does video contradict UP DGP claim of no bullet being fired?,"KANPUR: Amid repeated claims by Uttar Pradesh DGP O P Singh that not a single bullet has been fired on anti-CAA protesters, a video has gone viral on news channels showing a cop raising his gun to open fire amid sound of gunshots during clashes between police and protesters in Yateemkhana area of Kanpur, which witnessed massive violence on Saturday. Singh had also reiterated that those who died were caught in cross-fire and autopsy reports would prove this. In the 90-second video, a policeman wearing a chest guard and a protective head-gear can be seen loading his gun before walking towards the sidelines and taking position to shoot. With a baton in his left hand, he aims his gun towards the crowd. A man wearing a khaki pullover is heard shouting at a cameraman, asking him to stop shooting the incident and let policemen open fire. “Camera hata lo, aur inko goli chalane do (Put off your camera and allow him to fire),” he is heard saying. Sound of what appears to be gunshots can be heard in the background. When asked about the video, ADG Kanpur Zone, Prem Prakash, told TOI, “Not a single cop opened fire at the crowds. None of the persons from Yateemkhana was injured.” When TOI contacted IG Kanpur Range, Mohit Agarwal, he said, “When ammunition was returned by policemen after duty, the bullet count remained the same. This rules out the possibility of any cop who was deployed opening fire.” Doctors at the mortuary at LLR Hospital confirmed that all three protesters from Babupurwa had died of gunshot wounds. However, they refused to divulge the details of the bullet bore, which could throw light on whether it was fired from a gun normally used by cops or from a countrymade firearm. "
Lucknow,"Four TMC politicians detained at UP airport, sent back to Kolkata","LUCKNOW: UP police on Sunday whisked away two Trinamool party MPs and two former legislators to an undisclosed location moments after they touched down at Lucknow airport, and sent them back to Kolkata 5 hours later. The delegation — Dinesh Trivedi, Pratima Mondal, Nadimul Haque, and Abir Biswas — had come to meet families of those killed or detained in Old City areas of Lucknow during the anti-CAA protests. The MPs were detained after an intelligence alert, police said. “Police recovered provocative pamphlets in Bengali from the Old City areas. Six residents of Malda have also been arrested. This shows political forces are at work to disturb peace. The decision to detain TMC MPs was meant to stop political interference. Trinamool has no stake in UP and if some politicians come here with malicious intent, the government will act with an iron hand,” UP deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said. “We condemn the undemocratic action of the Uttar Pradesh government,” Nadimul Haque told TOI.

Kanpur,"Protesters in UP used guerrilla tactics, say cops","LUCKNOW: Small groups hiding in alleys mounting a sudden attack, illiterate children holding placards written in English, maximum mob mobilisation in areas with minimum police deployment — this seems to be the strategic blueprint of those protesting against the new citizenship law, say Uttar Pradesh police officers. Cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Meerut, Bahraich, Agra, Firozabad and Gorakhpur were all witness to planned violence, which has led to 18 deaths since Thursday. Inspector general of police (law and order) Praveen Kumar told TOI that based on reports sent by district police chiefs, the pattern of protests in the state resembled guerrilla tactics and the agitations were conducted with clinical precision. “We observed brick-batting was done during specific time periods, only in areas where deployment of forces was low,” Kumar said, adding that in many districts, police overheard protesters talking in Bengali and hurling stones at cops and media persons without provocation. Varanasi SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary told TOI that in Bhelupur, eight-year-olds were handed placards and made to protest on roads. “The children and their parents are mostly illiterate, how can they prepare placards in English,” he asked. The SSP said in Bajardiha area, some pamphlets were distributed two days ago with slogans against the Indian state, for which 70 persons have been arrested. He said in Madanpura, as many as 10,000 people assembled on Friday. “While children and teenagers were spotted, no elder person could be seen,” the SSP said, adding that a similar pattern was witnessed in Mau, Azamgarh, Jaunpur and Bhadohi when people returned from mosques after offering ‘namaz’. “Teenagers and boys remained at the forefront and indulged in brick-batting while the elderly stood several ranks behind,” said Braj Bhushan, additional director general of police, Varanasi. In Lucknow, additional SP (West) Vikas Tripathi said, “Those pelting stones and bricks were outsiders.” He said he had never seen such a form of protest where even after being pushed back, protesters kept hurling stones and torching police outposts and vehicles. Likewise, there was a method in the madness during protests in western UP too. Inspector general of police (Agra range) A Satish Ganesh told TOI, “We scanned footage in which some elders are seen talking to policemen and then suddenly moving to the crowd, giving some signal to young people before disappearing. Later, the younger lot takes policemen head on.” The officer further said that the attacks were organised by smaller groups. “They were hidden in alleys and lanes,” he said. "

Lucknow,"VHP, RSS cadres to reach out to people","LUCKNOW: VHP and RSS will mobilise their cadres to carry out a nationwide campaign to allay apprehensions on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). The move comes a day after BJP announced a nationwide mass contact programme to expose the “lies” being spread by opposition parties about CAA. VHP working president Alok Kumar told TOI that volunteers would hold ‘nukkad sabhas’ (street corner meetings) with Hindus and Muslims across the country to ward off misconceptions about CAA and NRC. “Around 2,000 such meetings are being planned in Delhi alone. Similar meetings will be held in various cities across the country. It is not CAA but NRC which is creating problems. Muslims need to be informed that India belongs to them as much as it does to Hindus,” he said. The VHP chief said unlike Pakistan, which is an Islamic state, India does not have a theocratic rule. “A ‘Hindu Rashtra’ is a cultural concept and not the state concept. Muslims should not be afraid,” he added. Sources said RSS will rope in volunteers of its affiliated organisation, Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), to reach out to the minority community. National co-convener of MRM Murari Das said they would expedite outreach among Muslims by organising meetings and workshops in many parts of the country. "
Lucknow,"Cabs came to halt, online food platters went dry","LUCKNOW: Internet shutdown for the last four days has slowed down the city’s pace. From payment through e-wallets and debit/credit cards to booking of app-based cabs and rail and air tickets, e-biz has been crippled by internet suspension. Cab bookingsUsers of app-based cabs are a worried lot. More than 3,000 cabs ply daily within the city. With no internet, 90% of the cabs are off roads, causing inconvenience to a large section of office-goers. Radha Bhatt, a resident of Mahanagar and a government employee, said, “I have a harrowing time walking 4km daily from my house till Badshahnagar Crossing to get an auto to my office on Vidhan Sabha road.” E-transactions A drop of 90% in the use of e-wallets and debit/credit cards has been reported. Users complained that only 10% shops and petrol pumps in the city have a Wi-Fi facility. As a result, long queues outside ATMs have become a common sight. A private bank official said netbanking transactions have also dropped significantly. Ticket bookingsOnline booking of rail, air and movie tickets has also taken a massive dive. Sale of online rail and tickets has declined by around 50%, while booking of online movie tickets has also been hit. Shaurya Jaiswal, a student of law in Lucknow University, had to rush home after he got the news of her mother falling sick. “I came to Hazratganj market where WiFi is free to book a train ticket to Dehradun.” Food delivery Several food outlets and restaurant owners in the city told TOI that online food ordering has declined by 90%. “We wanted to order food at home as going out in cold was a tough task, but had no option because net was not working,” said Abhigyan Sharma, a private executive.

Lucknow,BJP’s pro-CAA campaign to sway Muslims’ opinion,"Lucknow: After violent protests broke out in parts of Uttar Pradesh over the amended citizenship law, BJP is set to distribute booklets and handbills in the state, especially in Muslim-dominated pockets, to create awareness on the Citizenship Amendment Act. The move is part of a mass awareness programme to be launched by the BJP from December 26 to January 25. According to BJP leaders, booklets and handbills will essentially dwell on the fact that CAA is only meant to grant citizenship to minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and has nothing to with Muslims citizens of India. The booklet, titled Kamal Jyoti Pustika, will be distributed in cities which recently witnessed violence. UP BJP general secretary and in charge of the campaign, Govind Narain Shukla, said: “The idea is to remove misconceptions about CAA and to tell people how the opposition ranks have been fanning sentiments for political gains.” As per the plan chalked out by UP BJP brass, senior party leaders, MLAs and MPs will fan out across the state and hold small meetings with people in the otherwise communally-sensitive areas. Shukla said meetings and workshops would be held to assuage rising tempers and ask people not to fall in the trap of opposition parties which are inciting people. Sources said the BJP has also decided to rope in its IT cell to ensure that the message reaches maximum number of people. This will be followed by direct interaction with people, mainly Muslims, under ‘Samvad Karyakram’ where BJP leaders would visit both urban and rural areas of the state. "
Lucknow,How treasured customs make Christmas merrier for Anglo-Indian families,"LUCKNOW: Audrey McDonald makes sure to hide a silver coin in the plum cake she bakes for her family every Christmas. “The coin is to surprise children as they savour the cake,” explained the octogenarian, who is one of the oldest members of the Anglo-Indian community of Lucknow. Such Christmas rituals are among the many lost traditions that local Anglo-Indian families like the McDonalds have been enthusiastically observing since years. Exclusive to the community, these traditions are one of the many reasons why Christian families look forward to the festival. The existence of the Anglo-Indian community in Lucknow can be traced back to the 17th century and most of them had British for forefathers. “Our customs and sacraments are a unique blend of western and Indian influences,” said GJ Godin, who is a professor in Christian College. For McDonald and her family, Christmas is a traditional affair in her Aashiana home, where customs are followed to the hilt. “You can spot an Anglo-Indian home by the silver star put outside the house during Christmas,” said McDonald’s daughter-in-law Beryl. For an Anglo-Indian household, a typical Christmas feast would include delicacies like duck roast, salt meat chew, kull-kulls (a sweet fried snack made out of refined flour), roza cookies, plum cakes and ginger wine. Some members also set up an elaborate crib in their homes to depict the Nativity Scene — a three-dimensional set up depicting Jesus’ birth. “Every Christmas eve, we visit the cathedral to attend the mass at 12am and hail the birth of Jesus. On Christmas day, we sit down for a hearty lunch, which is followed by a round of singing and dancing by the bonfire in the evening,” said Beryl. In addition, attending the mass on Christmas morning in the church is another tradition that is observed by many members of the community. "
Lucknow,"Hit by CAA stir, Lucknow University stares at late session","LUCKNOW: The cancellation of LU semester examinations in December in view of the tension after anti-citizenship law protests may derail the academic session of law and postgraduate courses of the university and its affiliated colleges. The delay will affect around 15,000 students of LU and affiliated colleges. Though the examinations have been rescheduled from January 6-10, tension over CAA has resulted in loss of 20 crucial days for students. This, students said, would impact their internship chances and delay the declaration of results this semester and the examinations of next semester, which also hamper job prospects of final year graduates. “Either university will have to hold extra classes to compensate the lost time or extend the next semester session. Extra classes will clash with our internships,” said LLM student Abhijeet Bhaskar. He also said that the high court has a winter break in December and January and advocates are free to take students for internship, but the delay will close the opportunity for us. Final year students are more worried as derailment of the academic session can become a hurdle in appearing for competitive examinations or exploring job avenues. “A delay of even 15 days can affect our eligibility to apply for competitive examinations and jobs as submission of final year marksheet is mandatory in most of them,” said MA student Aparna Ojha. She said classes for the next semester begin in January first week, but that won’t be possible now since the last examination is scheduled on January 10. LU’s officiating vice-chancellor SK Shukla said, “Students need not worry as the evaluation of answersheets of exams held so far has begun. Also, classes for the next semester will begin on time without waiting for results.” "
Lucknow,"STF: Voices in audio clips of accused student, professors","Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh special task force, which is investigating Lucknow University’s LLB (semester III) paper leak case, has found that the voices in leaked audio clips have matched with that of the accused law teachers and the woman student. The STF said 40% of the questions dictated by two law professors to the student in six leaked audio clips appeared in the original paper. The scandal surfaced on December 11 when six audio clips were leaked and went viral on social media. The STF was asked to probe the case a day after. During interrogation, the two teachers accepted that voices in the clips were theirs but claimed that they were explaining syllabus to the woman student and were not leaking the question paper. The woman, however, denied that the voice was hers. An officer privy to the probe said all the leaked audio clips were played in a forensic lab and analyzed by experts. “We found that nearly 40% questions dictated by the teachers matched with the original paper. The voices in audio tapes also matched with the voice samples of teachers,” the officer added. The woman student is chairperson of a private medical college and studying law at a private law college affiliated to LU. Her examination centre was in another private law college. In one of the audio clips, the woman student can be heard negotiating a deal with the officers of the examination centre for a “favourable seat”. The STF officer said the digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTV installed at examination centre was also scanned in which the woman was found sitting inside the examination hall. Acting SSP STF Vishal Vikram Singh said, “Investigation is still underway. We are collecting electronic evidences to corroborate it with physical evidences before we submit it to the government.” While the STF probe is half way through, the inquiry committee constituted by LU to investigate the matter has not even met once so far. Law faculty members have defended the two teachers and have alleged that it was the officiating vice-chancellor SK Shukla who introduced the woman to faculty members and requested them to “help her”. The VC, however, has denied charges claiming that audio clips have proved that he never asked anyone to leak question paper. "

Lucknow,"‘Appeasement not BJP ploy, our focus is development’","LUCKNOW: At a time when BJP is under fire by the Opposition for bringing in what they call a divisive citizenship law, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said his party does not “indulge in appeasement like others”. Speaking at an event in Lucknow where the government handed over keys to recipients of houses under the Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana, Yogi said the slogan of ‘sabka saath, sabha vikas’ was a reality with BJP-led governments which work for everyone’s development without any discrimination. “Those who accuse us of discrimination must introspect. If they had worked for the development of all without any discrimination, the current scenario would have been different,” he said. Attacked by the Opposition for violence in UP during anti-citizenship law, the CM added that their desperation was “visible in their allegations”. He said: “People have evicted them from power due to their misdeeds and they are not going to return to power again anytime soon. At this time, their useless commentary on various issues is natural. These people who are making accusations against us have actually looted the deprived.” Governor Anandiben Patel, who also attended the programme, said only a poor or saint can understand the pain of the poor, adding: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has seen poverty and Yogiji is a saint.” On Monday morning, while paying his respects to former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh on his 117th birth anniversary, the CM targeted the Opposition once again saying that while they kept taking Singh’s name, they did nothing for the farmers for whom Singh dedicated his life. “Due to the apathy and carelessness of previous governments, farmers were neglected. Irrespective of the support price, farmers would be paid only Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 for one quintal of paddy. This year, the state government is paying Rs 1,835 of paddy directly to the farmer’s account,” he said. "
Lucknow,Energy farming to empower UP farmers,"Lucknow: In a first, the new Kisan Suraksha Utthan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) Scheme of the Centre is set to promote energy farming in agricultural sector in the state. The initiative is aimed making the best of ‘usar’ (alkaline) and ‘banjar’ (infertile) stretches of Bundelkhand which have been lying unproductive so far by using it for setting up solar energy plants, producing energy and selling it to government. The idea of ‘energy farming’ will not only help farmers to earn by selling power to government but also use it to operate their tube-wells for irrigation purposes. Energy minister Srikant Sharma said, “A study by the government of India shows that over 30 million agricultural pumps are installed in India. Of these, 10 million pumps are diesel-based. Nearly 17% electricity is consumed by agriculture water pumps. Being the largest state, Uttar Pradesh has maximum share. Energy farming will help in solving problems of the state and also benefit farmers to a great extent.” He said UPPCL would give subsidy to farmers to set up projects and sign a buy back arrangement. Before the launch of KUSUM Scheme, UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) has introduced a separate agriculture feeder for irrigation purposes to ensure adequate supply of power to tube wells, private as well as government. “Separate agriculture feeder scheme was first introduced about a decade back in Gujarat and then in Madhya Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh has not implemented agri-feeders now,” Sharma said, adding over 2,000 feeders already had direct supply for irrigation purposes in last two-and-a-half years. He said in next two years, remaining 2,500 feeders would be set up to cover the entire state. "
Lucknow,"Your room heater comes with warning of skin, hair damage","LUCKNOW: Madiaon resident Susmita Singh had to rush her five-month-old to a clinic after rashes on the baby’s face got more intense. The doctor blamed long exposure to room heater, which Singh kept in front of the baby when she slept. Diabetic Krishna Kumar suffered burns on Friday because the heater was too close to his feet. “By the time I realised, I had painful boils on my legs,” the Krishnanagar resident said. Singh and Kumar are not alone in their predicament. Most residents of the city sit or sleep dangerously close to room heaters or blowers to beat the cold. What they don’t realise is that prolonged use can do more harm than benefit. Besides rashes and burns, heaters set at high temperature can cause hair fall, nosebleed and breathing issues. “While adults may also get dry skin following excessive use of heater/blower, one must remember that children have more soft and sensitive skin. Apart from skin damage, dry air can cause nasal bleeding,” said Dr Sarika Gupta, a paediatrician at KGMU. “Blowers should never be used in closed rooms, as it can lower the oxygen level and cause breathing problems, Gupta added. D Himanshu, associate professor of medicine at KGMU, said oil-based radiators are safer than blowers/heaters because they heat the oil first. Associate professor Vikram Singh of Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences maintained that non-oil electrical heaters or blowers produced carbon monoxide if used in a closed chamber. "
Lucknow,I don’t think I’m as excited about my birthday cake as much as I am for the Christmas cake: Antara Banerjee,"Actress Antara Banerjee who has appeared in films like 'Shaukeens' and worked in television shows like 'Badho Bahu', 'Mahashivratri', 'Laal Ishq' and 'Kasautii Zindagii Kay', was recently in Lucknow for a professional commitment. During her short trip to the city, Antara spoke to us about her love for shopping, food, her journey in this industry and the challenges she has had to face as an outsider in the industry. ""When I landed in Lucknow, I was welcomed by a beautiful cold winter morning. I love winters the most actually, but unfortunately Mumbai mein kuchh khaas thanda hota nahi. Lucknow ke toh chikan kurtas itne mushoor hai. They’re supposed to be so comfortable and easy-breezy in the summers. Tundey kebabs is another thing that I’m dying to try here,"" said Antara on her first visit to the city. Antara added, ""I had the biryani at Idrees. It was just so good and fabulous. I can plan another trip to Lucknow all over again just for the food."" When asked about the actress’s Christmas plans, she said, ""I have plans of going to Kolkata for the festival as there’s this place there, Park Street, where Christmas is celebrated in the most majestic way. It’s basically a Christian area with many churches and all, even my school is right there. The mass takes place at midnight so I have plans of attending it and going out with a bunch of friends for Christmas dinner."" Antara Banerjee (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Antara Banerjee (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Antara added, ""I don’t think I’m as excited for my birthday cake as much as I am for the Christmas cake. I absolutely love it and I wait every year for Christmas just to have that cake. As a child, I actually believed in Santa Claus like many other kids. I used to prepare a wish list of all the things I wanted before going to bed on Christmas eve, hoping I would get my list of things the next day from Santa. Luckily, I would get most of the things mentioned in my list. As I grew up, I became aware of the reality behind Santa Claus,"" chuckled Antara. Antara, who is a trained classical dancer and started dancing from grade 1 said, ""I learnt the Lucknow gharana style in Kathak and it has contributed greatly in my acting skills. In fact I feel dance got me closer to acting. There’s one very big similarity between acting and dancing, which is expressions. So when you’re already trained in that, it helps you a lot in acting."" When asked about why Antara quit the show 'Kasautii Zindagii Kay', the Kolkata born quickly replied, ""I have been working in the television industry since long. As soon as I got a call for Kasautii, I actually didn’t even check what’s the character or what’s the role, I just straight away jumped into it. So I started shooting and it was going all well but then because of the pressure of building up all the characters, some 18-20 characters in the whole show, the creatives obviously couldn’t do justice to all. My character was framing up in a way which I didn’t like very much. So it was a mutual decision of the production house, the creative team and myself that I quit the show. There was no problem whatsoever."" The actress who played the role of Suman in the show, further revealed that it all happened in a very cordial way.  -Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,NREGA wages: Errant officials to pay for delay,"Lucknow: To check late payment of wages to workers under MGNREGA, UP government has introduced a fine on officials concerned for every day of delay in payment beyond 15 days. The fine, fixed at 0.05% of the current daily wage of Rs 182 which amounts to 9 paise per day, will be deducted from the salary of officials found responsible for delay in distribution of wages.

Lucknow,VHP meet to press for temple in Ayodhya via public funding,"LUCKNOW: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) is set to resolve for the construction of proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya through public funding and by an independent trust free of government intervention, during its four-day convention scheduled to held at Mangaluru (Karnataka) from December 26. Confirming the move, VHP national general secretary Milind Parande told TOI, “Ram temple should not be ‘sarkaari’. It should belong to and constructed by scores of Hindus with strong affiliation and belief that Lord Ram was born at the Ram Janmbhoomi site in Ayodhya.” He said the temple’s model proposed by VHP should be adopted and stones which have been carved and kept at Karsewakpuram be used for construction. “Nearly 60% work has already been done,” Parande said. The statement comes days after Union home minister and BJP president Amit Shah said that the Trust proposed for Ram temple construction would not have any member of the BJP. According to VHP sources, the resolution demanding an independent Trust for temple construction is likely to figure prominently during the convention which will be attended by top brass of the organization and prominent seers. During the meet, VHP will also discuss the amended citizenship law which has led to violent protests in various parts of the country, including Uttar Pradesh. “There is an urgent need to dispel misconceptions about the citizenship law and arrest rumour-mongering which has stoked violent protests,” Parande said. VHP is also planning a nationwide campaign by mobilizing its cadre to hold meetings with people in different parts of the country, especially in cities which were rocked by violence and vandalism. VHP international vice-president Champat Rai said the organization would also strengthen its machinery to reach out to maximum people. The organization will also take up the issue of religious conversion. A senior VHP functionary said, “We have no objection if conversion is voluntary. No one should motivate a person to convert.” VHP has been highly critical of religious conversions by Christian missionaries and ‘love jihad’, an alleged attempt by Muslim men to convert non-Muslim women to Islam by feigning love. Another key agenda on the card is ‘sewa karya’ where VHP cadre organize educational and health camps for people. "
Lucknow,Net outage robs many of Christmas celebrations in Lucknow,"By: Akshata Mishra LUCKNOW: Internet blackout in the city for the past five days has dampened the Yuletide spirit for many who love sharing Christmas messages and videos on social media platforms or depend on e-commerce sites for last-minute festive shopping. Circulating invites and programme schedule of various churches has also taken a big hit, leaving scores of netizens annoyed. “I have been swamped with calls for two days. People want to know if our church celebrations are on this year, as we were unable to send out invitations on the WhatsApp group,” said Janice Elena John, a resident of Jankipuram Extension. Young Lucknow is a particularly disgruntled lot with no accessible internet connection to share pictures and videos with friends near and far. Those who planned to stream live parties are sulking to say the least. “When I browse the morning newspaper, I see so many shopping websites offering big discounts to spread the Christmas cheer. My hard luck, I am unable to order any clothes or accessories online,” complained Kanika of Nishatganj. Felix Sebastian, a resident of Chowk, said it was a tradition to send presents to his cousins abroad every Christmas. “I failed to keep the tradition alive this year, thanks to the internet shutdown,” he rued.

Lucknow,I wish Sudhir starts making Mehrunnisa soon: Chitrangda Singh,"Actor-producer-writer Chitrangda Singh was in Lucknow recently for an event where she spoke to youngsters about prospects in Bollywood and how they should go about tapping them. Later, the 'Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi' actress spoke to LT exclusively about the talent in Uttar Pradesh, her next production being another inspirational biopic and how she’s looking forward to filmmaker Sudhir Mishra making the film 'Mehrunissa' soon. Talking about young talent in Uttar Pradesh, Chitrangda, who has produced the Diljit Dosanjh-Taapsee Pannu starrer 'Soorma', said that the state had immense talent in writing, music and acting which needs to be utilized properly. She also went on to say that UP will see more films being shot in the state if things were better organized in terms of facilities provided to filmmakers. ""Filmmakers are always looking for organised infrastructure at locations. It’s virtually not possible for us to bring the entire crew from Mumbai, so it is always a big advantage if we have skilled and experienced people available at locations where we are shooting. So, I would want the local talent to update themselves so that we can hire them on project basis when we come to shoot here,"" said the Inkaar actress. Giving her suggestions on how to go about this, Chitrangda said, ""There needs to be a structure on how they can bring in the talent. So if there can be some kind of a directory of such people then it would be great. Like a list of actors, writers, technicians, line producers, casting directors, etc. Their skills can be utilized and the filmmakers coming here are also helped in their projects and employment is also generated.""

In the audience I could see so many youngsters who were thinking ki hamein kyun nahi milta chance, hum bhi toh yahin se hain, so why can’t we be given an opportunity. And that only comes in when they don’t have a clear way of getting there. Abhi toh they are actually depending on local line producers who may recommend their name to the filmmakers or may not. We need to identify such talent and make a pool of writers, photographers, actors, singer, production assistants and utilize their talent in films being made here in the state. Give them crash courses to let them know the basics of what they want to do. Let there be courses for writers, directors, script writers, actors etc."" Adding further, she said, ""UP is throbbing with talent. Whether it is singers, actors, stories, locations, everything is working in favour of the state. And sabse bada advantage that UP has is its language. Yahan ki zubaan itni achhi hai and you only realize that when you reach Mumbai. Because I am also from UP, yeh aapko tabhi realise hota hai ki aapke paas saaf boli aur bhasha ka kitna bada advantage hai jab aap Mumbai mein logon ko bolte sunte ho. Yahan ka lehja itna fark hai aur Lucknow aur Prayagraj jaisi jagahon ka toh aur bhi zyada. So basically the youngsters here need to know that they are so special and that innocence of being from a small town is even more special. So just maintain that and treasure that because that is your trump card. Don’t try to be the big city kid because we have enough of those, in plenty in Mumbai, so don’t try for that. Maintain your individuality."" An actress, writer and now also a producer, ask Chitrangada which is most exciting for her and she says, ""You do what you can but I love all of these. There’s nothing that I would leave to do the other. The most challenging although I would say was the film that I produced – Soorma. And that’s just because it went on for so long. The most exciting though will be acting, especially when you get the right project to act in. There is nothing more exciting than that. But I’m not at all satisfied with the roles offered to me. In fact, I don’t think any actor can say that they are satisfied with the roles they are offered. You make do with what you get and when you don’t get the right kind of roles, you don’t work. I’ve been fortunate enough to have got a very good response for all my acting projects, I’m very satisfied with that. But needless to say I’m looking for good and more and more work."" She goes on to add, ""See nothing is easy. But if you have the passion for it, you do it anyhow. That’s what I have done where my acting, writing and production is concerned. I’m very passionate about whatever I do, so although it’s difficult, I take it more as a challenge and thus end up enjoying it eventually. Soorma was a tough challenge. I was testing new waters with it and I’m happy that I succeeded in the effort. And now Sandeep has gone and become the Sports Minister, which I am so-so proud of!"" Chitrangda Singh (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Sidiqui) Chitrangda Singh (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Sidiqui) Loving being a producer, Chitrangda says she is planning on making another biopic. ""It is another very motivational and inspiring story but the character I don’t want to disclose as yet,"" she says, adding, ""I have two scripts. I’m hoping to get the best talent on board for those. The ones that I have written are still waiting to be made. Actually I’ve also written a children’s film. There aren’t too many stories which are told through children. So this film is not childish but it is about children because I feel that sometimes children can have a lot to say and communicate. Sometimes their thoughts can be very mature and make a lot of sense."" Ask her how the writing bug bit her and she smiles and says that for that she has to thank one of her favourite filmmakers, Sudhir Mishra. ""Sometimes Sudhir and I would be sitting and discussing a scene and I would make suggestions on how to do it or how it should be presented. And then he was gracious enough to allow me to write a couple of scenes in a few films. Like in Inkaar I have written a scene. That scene in the bathroom with Arjun and me. I’m grateful to Sudhir to let me write it because it was so personal, that interaction between us to actors in the film. In fact he said, ‘why don’t you write this scene if this is what you think a woman should do in this kind of a situation’. Honestly that’s where it started for me and he really encouraged me to do it and take it further. He thought ki kuchh keeda hai ismein and isko kuchh karo aur likhwao. So then I wrote a 30-pager story and it all started from there. And now it’s like once you start to write you see stories and it’s become a passion for me."" Although Chitrangda feels that there’s not much difference in a woman or a man’s writing and men can be just as sensitive as women, she does think that women writers are not very judgmental about their character’s faults. ""You can’t generalize men writers or women writers. Some men are so sensitive and they can bring in a different tangent to a relationship when they can half-think like a woman. Whereas sometimes women can’t half-think like a man. Women tend to become a lot more defensive at times because being a woman they see what women go through. So sometimes women can become one-dimensional. That balance is very important when you’re writing. With women the emotion is very important. Her sensuality, sexuality and her predicaments are definitely handled better by women writers. But at the same time, women are not so judgmental because we know our flaws. Whereas men look at it in a more black and white way at times when it comes to women and their faults. They can write books on that (laughs)."" Talking of acting, we haven’t seen Chitrangda in a film since 'Saheb Biwi Aur Ganster 3' in 2018. But the actress says that it’s the best time for actors in Bollywood. ""Actors are now superstars. You don’t have to be a star to be a star in Bollywood now. I remember Naseer (Naseeruddin Shah) sahab said a long time back that he’s an actor and not a star. But today you need to be an actor to be a star. That’s the change we’ve seen now which is wonderful. We have Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao who are doing such wonderful work. Also, the audience is more discerning now. They want to see their own stories there on screen. They just don’t want to see and idea of what a hero is. The audience now wants to be the hero! In fact, we are all heroes in our own rights and that’s what we want to see on screen. When an ordinary becomes extraordinary!"" she says. Finally we can’t help asking the 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3' and 'Yeh Saali Zindagi' actress about her equation now with filmmaker Sudhir Mishra, whose last two films didn’t feature Chitrangda whom he once referred to as his muse. ""I would always love to work with him. We were just talking about Mehrunnisa the last time we met. And we came so close to making the film and in Lucknow! The sets had also been set up. I remember I had worked so hard for the film to prepare for the character but it never got made. That’s my one regret. I wish Sudhir starts making that film soon. Please tell him to make the film soon!"" "
Lucknow,Songs today don’t have a shelf life: Shailendra Singh,"The yesteryear’s singer and actor, Shailendra Singh of 'Main Shayar Toh Nahin' fame was in the city to meet his sister who lives in the city in Aliganj.

Lyrics too are not that great in today’s time. Do you find any meaningful song today, no na? Ek-aad gaana aata hai acchha, wo bhi kabhi kabhi. Music directors are catering to the younger lot and for them rhythm is more important now. So, technically we have advanced a lot but not quality wise."" He adds, ""There were good writers, directors, composers earlier. Name a good composer today? Because they cannot compose, so they are coming up with lots of remixes. Keyboard bajane waala composer nahi hota kabhi bhi. Pehle situation ke hisaab se gaana likhte thay, lyrics were meaningful and were in sync with the story. But in the present time, putting a catchy word in a song is in vogue. So what happens is that these songs are played for 10 days in pubs and then they are forgotten.

Lucknow,PM Narendra Modi sharpens attack on protesters for anti-CAA riots,"LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday sharpened his attack on anti-CAA protesters for destroying public property in what can further polarise the debate on large-scale violence and the police response. “Can we justify the way people protested and damaged public property after enactment of the citizenship law? People should ask if it was correct. I appeal to people not to fall into the trap of rumours. People do have rights, but they are also duty-bound to protect public property, which is there for future generations. Whatever was torched, was it not for their children’s use?” Modi said. Addressing a gathering that included UP CM Yogi Adityanath, the PM came out strongly in support of police. “People need to respect police, who are there to protect them,” he said in what marked a second public gesture of solidarity with the force since Sunday when he condemned the attacks on security personnel. CAA protests: Editors Guild slam police for 'violence' against journalistsHis remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of BJP’s political opponents as well as activists on the violence. Opposition parties and certain civil society groups have accused BJP governments in states of unleashing repression on protesters. On Atal Bihari Vajpayee's anniversary, PM says rights subject to reasonable curbsThe divergence in depictions of the role of protesters and police in the violence in the rival narratives points to the chasm that the changes in the Citizenship Act have opened up. Modi’s speech to mark the birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee came at a time when UP is in the throes of a political confrontation as well as what looks to be a social divide over the violent anti-CAA protests allegedly involving large-scale use of firearms as well as the unusually tough police response, including   imposition of punitive fines on rioters   for destruction of public property and the alleged vandalisation of personal assets of those responsible for attacks on men in khaki. Modi said the mobs fell prey to rumourmongers, but stressed that rights were subject to reasonable restrictions and could not be pursued in isolation from duties. “Haq ki ek maryada hai... dayra hai, seema hai. Lekin dayitwa ki, kartavya ki bhawna bahut hi vyapak hai (Rights have limits whereas responsibilities and duties have a vast expanse),” the PM said, his pitch reflecting the efforts his government has lately been making to put citizens’ duties on the same footing as the rights they enjoy. Modi also strongly defended the changes in the law to fast-track citizenship for people belonging to religious minorities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who fled to India to avoid persecution, ruling out any backtracking. “Bharat ki 130 crore janata ne Pakistan, Afghanistan aur Bangladesh se aaye sharnarthiyon ki garima ke liye aur unhein angikaar karne ka mann bana liya hai (The 130 crore population of India has decided to accept the minorities who have faced humiliation in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh),” he said. The PM was combative also about his decision to scrap J&amp;K’s special status. Calling Article 370 a “disease” that plagued the development of not only Jammu &amp; Kashmir but also the rest of India for decades, Modi said it was passed on to his government as a legacy and it was solved without even a murmur. Modi also laid stress on peace and tranquillity that ensued following the Supreme Court order giving the disputed land in Ayodhya for the construction of Ram Mandir. “This issue too had festered for long. No protest happened when the judgment on the vexed Ram Janmabhoomi case was announced by the Supreme Court,” he said, adding that India had entered a new decade where intractable problems that had dogged the country for several decades were getting resolved. PM Modi also said the country was moving out of the process of attestation. “Your declaration is enough. All documents, including birth and death certificates, are online now,” PM Modi said. The government had on Tuesday announced that it would accept self-certified documents for enrolment in the National Population Register. "

Lucknow,PM Narendra Modi invokes Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his holistic vision while laying university foundation,"LUCKNOW: Invoking former Prime Minister and BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said development should not be viewed discreetly, but holistically. Speaking on 95th birth anniversary of Vajpayee, Modi said the statue and the proposed medical university in the name of Vajpayee was a biggest tribute to a leader, who believed that good governance was not possible until problems are solved in a holistic manner. “When Atalji was MP of Lucknow, he initiated development work, including the ring road and brought new identity to Lucknow,” Modi said, after inaugurating a 25-foot tall bronze statue of Vajpayee and laying the foundation of an umbrella university in the name of stalwart BJP leader at Lok Bhawan. The university, he said, projects the holistic view of development of medical infrastructure. “Be it medical, dental or paramedical colleges, the university will ensure the same educational calendar and enhance quality in education,” he said. Modi said the vision of his government has been clear since day one. “In the health sector, we are focusing on preventive and affordable healthcare and intervention in a mission mode. All government schemes are moving in the same direction,” he said, adding Swacch Bharat Abhiyan, Yoga, Ujjawala scheme and Fit India movement are part of preventive vision. Ayurveda can also play its role in preventive health care, he said. The PM said while 1.25 lakh wellness centres are required in rural areas, his government was expediting immunization programme in a big way. He said affordability is also been taken up through Ayushman Bharat scheme. Modi said 70 lakh people have already benefited from the scheme. “The list of beneficiaries who are to be covered under Ayushman Bharat scheme is more than the population of Canada, the US and Mexico taken together,” he said, adding in UP alone 11 lakh people were benefited under the Ayushman scheme. Modi also hailed his government initiative to open Jan Aushadhi Centre provisioning cheaper medicine to the needy.

Lucknow,Anti-CAA protesters’ phone location shows crowds outsourced,"LUCKNOW: ‘Watan ke liye jung’, ‘Hum layenge kranti’, ‘Vijaypath’ and ‘Kranti ki shuruwat’ may sound to be the titles of Bollywood flicks but are actually names of groups formed on messaging apps WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal which were used to “outsource” crowd from various districts of the state to hold protests against new citizenship law in Lucknow on December 19. The protest turned violent leaving one dead and 30 others, including 16 policemen, injured. Nodal officer of the cyber cell of Lucknow police Abhay Mishra said, “People arrested for violence revealed during interrogation that protesters were brought from other districts. They confessed that groups were deliberately created on patriotic themes to motivate teenagers from over a dozen districts including Mau, Azamgarh, Jalaun, Sitapur, Barabanki and Bahraich who came down to Lucknow to participate in protest.” Mishra said probe revealed that phone numbers registered in other districts were found active at Parivartan Chowk, Khadra and Thakurganj from 1pm to 5pm on December 19. “These phone users were also in touch with those arrested for violence. This corroborates that crowd was sourced from other districts to instigate violence. Most of these protesters were teenagers,” he added. Mishra said over 20,000 photographs and 2,000 videos collected from CCTV cameras, recorded by cops and intelligence units and provided by media persons were being checked to trace the role of outsiders in violence. “Police teams are checking 50 hotels in Kaiserbagh, Naka and Charbagh to find out if the miscreants stayed there,” he said.

Lucknow,I can’t make fake relations with people to get work in Bollywood: Lucknowite Shivam Bhaargava,"The year 2019 has been good for Lucknow-born actor Shivam Bhaargava, whose debut film released this year. The actor, an alumnus of Study Hall, loves his hometown and never misses a chance to come back to his city to meet his family and friends. In a freewheeling chat about Lucknow and its delicious food, Shivam, said, “All my closest friends are from Lucknow. I never miss a chance to come here and spend some time with family and friends. Back when I was living in Lucknow, my friends and I would keep riding our motorcycles up and down all day at the Marine Drive in Gomti Nagar.” Expressing his love for food here Shivam, who made his Bollywood debut with Vikram Bhatt’s horror film 'Ghost' opposite Sanaya Irani, added, “Right behind my house (near the Capitol cinema) is this amazing lassi that you get with khoya and dry fruits. It’s a tiny shop but the lassi is just so good. Of course there’s Tundey, then there are Marksmen ke burgers which are to die for.” Telling us about his foray in Bollywood, Shivam says that he first started modelling and then progressed to being an actor. Having acted in several short films, Shivam says gave him confidence to venture in Bollywood. “When I was a kid, I wanted to be an army man, an archaeologist, a lawyer, a scientist, all of this. I was like kaise karun main yeh sab? Then one day I was watching a film and someone said ki for that particular role one of a lawyer in the film, the actor had done a lot of research and studied a lot about the character. Then I thought to myself that if I become an actor, tab main yeh sab kar paunga. That idea just got stuck in my head and it never changed.” Shivam further said, “I still love doing so many random things and as an actor, you can actually explore and do it for work.” Shivam Bhaargava (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Shivam Bhaargava (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.When asked if he is treated any different by his family or friends now that he has appeared on the silver screen, the 'Ghost' actor said, “They’re my closest people. Their behaviour towards me hasn’t changed one bit, and I’m happy about it. They’re very happy and seem really proud of me, which in turn brings a smile to my face.” Shivam’s mother, Meher Bhargava had been killed in an unfortunate incident when he was very young. The young actor shared that losing his mother at an early age impacted his life in a big way. “It was a big event in my life and has shaped me into the person that I am today. I don’t think losing a parent at any age can be easy. When I lost my mother, it was a very tender time in life. That’s probably why none of this means as much to me as it might have if she were around. Losing my mother made me realise how temporary life is and how fleeting all of these things are. Also, I’m very very proud of what she did and I have so much respect for women. The way I treat and interact with women is because of my mother, because of who she was and because of how she brought me up. I’m very grateful for that.” He said that his mother was the kind who would stand up for her rights despite all odds. Shivam went on to add that, “She was a very strong woman and that’s who she was. I don’t expect anything different from her.” When asked him about what gives him an edge in Bollywood being a Lucknowite, he said, “The language! Our Hindi is so clear and clean. That definitely helps a lot. I see so many people struggle with that.” He further revealed, “I just try to work and let my work speak for itself. I won’t lie, it’s been difficult being an outsider. Honestly, I’ve not expected anything from anyone there, neither am I good with networking. I can’t make fake relations with people in order to get work in Bollywood, so it’s been tougher for me. If I could, maybe that would’ve helped. But I’m glad enough to have gotten the opportunities to showcase some of my work, and hopefully, this will get me more.” The Ghost actor was asked about which director he is looking forward to work with and he responds, “I’d love to work with Zoya Akhtar. She just works so well with her actors. Even the smallest part in the film is there for a reason and they have an important part to play. I love that. There are just so many – Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Sanjay Leela Bhansali just for the grandeur, that would be awesome!” "

She was ordered to appear at Kochi international airport, 20km away, for “questioning” because she had participated in a peaceful anti-CAA protest rally in Ernakulam on December 23. On the same day that Janne took part in the protests, a German student who had taken part in a protest in Chennai had been ordered to leave India.

Immigration officials refused to specify under what section Janne was questioned, saying only that visa regulations “generally prohibit” a tourist from taking part in such protests. “I went to the December 23 march alone where we walked 12km from Gandhi Circle in Ernakulam to Vasco da Gama Square in Fort Kochi. As a precaution, I had even asked the local police station if I as a foreigner could take part in the protest and I was given a verbal assurance that I could,” Janne said. She told TOI that she was asked questions about her visits to Delhi and Lucknow. “I was asked to give out details of my friends and extended Indian family in Delhi and Lucknow but I refused to do so right away. I was asked to write a statement about my participation,” Janne said. FRRO officials said they have initiated an inquiry into Janne’s participation in the protest. “She is here on atourist visa. There is a possibility of foreign nationals posing for pictures alongside such protests. Unlike the German student who was deported for his participation in the protests, this woman doesn’t seem to be actively involved in the campaign against the CAA.

Lucknow,I have lovely memories of Lucknow. I really miss this place in Mumbai: Shruti Sharma,"Actress Shruti Sharma, who hails from Lucknow and rose to fame after playing Dhanak in television serial 'Gathbandhan,' was recently in her hometown to shoot for her first Bollywood film featuring Sanya Malhotra. Shruti, who’s playing an important character in the Oscar winning filmmaker Guneet Monga’s 'Pagglait,' is also awaiting the release of her Telugu film. Telling us about her debut Bollywood film, she said, ""The movie is a Lucknow-based story revolving around relationships. The film is a women-centric and has brilliant actors. I couldn’t have asked for a better debut in Bollywood. I mean, I feel really proud to make my Bollywood debut with an Oscar winning filmmaker like Guneet ma’am and that too in my hometown, Lucknow. I had watched her documentary Periods which won an Oscar. I gave the audition for the film and after that when I got to know the details about who’s directing it, I was so happy and literally on cloud nine. Guneet ma’am is a really warm person. Not even for a moment did she let me feel like a newcomer. It’s been a huge learning experience working with her."" Shruti Sharma also played the lead character Dhanak in the show Gathbandhan (BCCL) Shruti Sharma also played the lead character Dhanak in the show Gathbandhan (BCCL) On how this New Way Senior Secondary School alumna came to be the lead actor of a popular TV show, Shruti explained that she used to love doing theatre and that love translated into acting in music videos and then Gathbandhan. ""As a kid, I would mimic heroines in front of the mirror. As I grew, my passion for acting increased and I decided to become an actor but my father disapproved of that as he’s very protective of me and he feared my security in this industry. So I did small plays which I even happened to write and direct myself. I would protest in front of my father and tell him that I can’t become anything else and that I want to become an actor and go to Mumbai to make a career. Finally, he gave in and let me follow my dreams,” said the Telugu film Agent Sai Srinivas Athreya actress, who learnt Telugu for her part in the film. Shruti Sharma (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Shruti Sharma (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) She added, “I did plays so I could prove to my father how badly I wanted to become an actor. I told him that I can’t be a teacher or a banker, I only see myself acting."" After having directed a couple of plays and acted on different platforms, Shruti feels being a director is a tough job. She said, ""When you’re an actor, you’re only expected to focus on your lines, your character and your blockings, whereas as a director you have to think about the whole project, every character, every scene, every actor’s position and expressions, and you have to make sure that every element is different from the previous one. That’s why a director is called the leader of the ship. Being a director is a lot of hard work, honestly."" ""I want to open an acting school in Lucknow some day. Through that I want to give a chance to the people of the city who are immensely talented but lack the opportunities,"" stated Shruti. Talking about some of her best memories of Lucknow, Shruti said, ""When I used to work in theatre, after the rehearsals we would go to 1090 Chauraha to have papdi, chaat and all. Then there’s this King’s Chat Corner which serves the best chaat and pani ke batashe. Mansarovar gives amazing chowmein, I miss Lucknow food so much. Mumbai mein toh chowmein hi nahi milta. Also, I miss my college days so much, we would have dosas and I remember, I would be participating in most of the cultural activities, competitions, dramatics and stuff. Then, times near the riverfront and all the memories of IT College are just so precious."" — Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,Lucknow Municipal Corporation may lose swachh point in treating sewage,"LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) may lose points in the ‘water plus protocol’ category being introduced in Swachh Bharat Survekshan, an annual pan-India sanitation survey conducted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs, in January 2020. Under this parameter, the capacity of treating sewage before discharge is assessed. An urban local body treating around 95% of sewage generated will get 100% marks. However, in Lucknow, only around 57.72% is handled at the two sewage treatment plants (STPs). According to LMC records, of the 2.46 lakh litre sewage produced daily, around 1.44 lakh litre is treated at the Daulatganj and Bharwara STPs while the rest flows unprocessed into the Gomti through 37 high drains. In addition, 180 small drains also discharge effluents and solid waste into the river. Going by the numbers, LMC will get around 60 marks in this category.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Crossing a road, push button to stop traffic","LUCKNOW: Inspired by Europe and America, and closer home Pune and Bangalore, Lucknow is all set to introduce the pelican crossing that allows a pedestrian to push a button and signal traffic to a halt. The smart system, which has been successful in ensuring greater road safety in countries like Germany and Ireland, will be introduced at 110 intersections in the city, including those in Gomtinagar, Jankipuram, Aliganj, Mahanagar, Indiranagar, Hazratganj, Lalbagh and Charbagh. Hitherto absent zebra crosswalks would also be painted at these intersections. The pilot projects will begin at IT College and Parivartan Chowk intersections in January and cover the remaining 108 crossings by the end of 2020. Typically, a pelican crossing has a pair of poles each with a standard set of traffic lights facing oncoming vehicles. A push button and two illuminated, coloured pictogram face the pedestrian from across the road. These are a red, stationary person to indicate that it is not safe to cross and a green, walking person to indicate that it is safe to do so. Pelican crossings world over also normally provide non-visual indication such as a beep or vibrating button to assist visually impaired pedestrians. LMC officials said they would employ an operator to push the button. As soon as number of pedestrians who want to cross road reaches 8-10, operator will press the button that will turn on the red light for traffic. “Currently, road intersections here are either controlled manually or through conventional traffic lights. One big disadvantage of these two methods is that they generally ignore pedestrian ease. The new system, known as Pelican crossing, which is part of ITMS and will be installed at a cost of Rs 2 crore, will be safe and pedestrian-friendly,” said Ashar Zaidi, general manager, Smart City project.

Kanpur,House tax OTS scheme proposal to be tabled on Saturday,"KANPUR: The proposal of a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for house tax, likely to be implemented in the city soon, will be tabled in the Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC) house meeting to be held on December 28. According to KMC officials, around 3,65,534 residential building owners of the city would be benefitted from this scheme. Around 38,817 non-residential houses have however been excluded from the scheme. Under the OTS scheme, the house owners clearing their outstanding house tax dues would get a 20 percent rebate till January 31, 2020. Thereafter, they would get 10 percent rebate till March 31, 2020, said a KMC official. According to sources, since the OTS scheme is an old scheme, therefore, it is mandatory for the officials to get it passed in the house. According to additional municipal commissioner, Amrit Lal Bind, the state government had sanctioned the old scheme with a direction that only residential property owners would avail the benefit of this scheme. The KMC is reeling under severe financial crisis for the last five years firstly because the state government had slashed financial aid to Kanpur and secondly the KMC failed to collect 100 percent tax through its own network, the source further said. It may be mentioned that as against the house tax target of Rs 220.48 crore fixed by the state government, the KMC could realize only around Rs 101 crore till December 27. ""The KMC hopes to collect around Rs 173 crore under the OTS scheme. As per the records, the house tax amounting to Rs 39.77 crore is due against 3.65 lakh residential house owners. Since the house tax has remained unpaid, the total outstanding amount is around 60.88 crore, including Rs 21.11 crore as interest"", said a KMC official. Similarly, Rs 73.87 crore tax pending against non-residential house owners has touched Rs 113.02 crore mark including Rs.39.20 crore as interest, he added. As per data, zone-5 is on the top in recovery as it has collected Rs 23.01 crore as against 45.75 crore. Next in the list is zone-1 which has collected Rs. 17.50 crore as against Rs 40.97 crore while zone-4 is at the bottom as it could collect Rs 14.57 crore against Rs 41.17 crore.

Lucknow,"Congress smells blood, to escalate citizenship stir","NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi will lead a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Guwahati, the ground zero of unrest, as Congress looks to escalate the confrontation with BJP with nationwide rallies against the contentious law on the party’s 134th Foundation Day on Saturday. On the other hand, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will a protest against CAA-NRC and “failure” of the government’s economic policies in Lucknow — lending a face to the party’s charge. In Assam, Rahul will also meet families of Sam Stafford and Dipanjal Das, two youths who died in police firing.

Kanpur,Only private parties for most Kanpurites this New Year’s Eve,"With New Year Eve celebrations just two days away, people in Kanpur are in the party mode. But unlike most years, this time city folk are wanting to have their private celebrations rather than go to a club or a hotel to party. The reasons are many for this marked change, but Kanpurites this year want a ghar-wali party. Overcrowded hotels and clubs make the New Year parties boring... Businessman Bharat Agarwal is in no mood of partying in a club or a hotel this New Year Eve. In fact, he will be attending a private party being organised by one of his friends at his farmhouse. “Last year we all went to a New Year party together and we all were struggling to get our drinks because of the huge crowd at the bar. Things got so boring that after some time we left the party and went to a friend’s place to party which was way more fun. To avoid a repeat of that, my wife and I will party at another freind’s farmhouse on December 31,” says he. Same is the case with businessman Naveen Kool who will also be attending a private party this New Year eve. He says, “Pehle toh itna mehenga entry pass khareediye aur phir bheed ki wajah se na toh drink mile aur naa hi snacks....toh phir aisi New Year party mein jaane ka kya fayda? Most of theses parties are overcrowded and it’s more of jostling than dancing and enjoying, that’s why it will be a private affair for me this year. Some of my close friends and I have decided to party on a terrace of one of our friend’s house this Tuesday. We decorate the terrace with lights and orgranise a bonfire and a barbeque party.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.No drunken driving Not wanting to be slapped with a challan in the new year, a few people say they would rather not drive on the New Year’s Eve and party at home. Businessman Shikhar Jain says, “Last year after partying on New Year’s Eve I was caught by the cops for drunken driving. Woh toh uss samay fine itna zyada nahi tha toh koi fark nahi pada abki baar pakad liye gaye toh band hi baj jayegi. That’s why I am organising a party at my place this New Year’s Eve. We will party hard and all those attending the party at my place will stay back and will only return to their homes in the morning. Aise mein sab party bhi full on karenge aur challan hone ka bhi darr nahi rahega.” Agrees businessman Robin Sinha, who says, “Returning from a New Year party in a drunken state is a big risk this year. Agar police ne pakad liya toh itna heavy fine lagega ki jaldi bhool bhi nahi payenge. So, to avoid all these things I have decided to attend a private party at a farmhouse in Bithoor. We all will party till the wee hours and then return the next day. Naa koi bheed ka naa koi traffic cops ka tension aur masti bhi full on.” "

Named Makdum Hotel, the tea stall is opposite Khandari Bazaar police outpost in Kaiserbagh and the only source of income for the family. Hameed ran it because Raheem sustained multiple fractures on his right leg in an accident. “I was asleep on December 19 when neighbours told me that cops had picked up my son and the helpers from the stall when they were having dinner,” Raheem said. The anxious father had rushed to Kaiserbagh police station and was told Hameed was a rioter. “My son never left the stall. I kept telling cops that, but nobody listened to me,” Raheem said, his eyes moist. “Our income is a meagre Rs 15,000 a month and we live in a shanty.

We will cover half the journey by train this time; then take a road trip from Delhi; cover Shimla and explore the small town of Narkanda, especially the wooden Hatu Temple at 11,152ft. It has a fascinating legend involving the Pandavas,” Shubhi said, adding that she could not wait to binge on authentic Tibetan food. (Inputs from Akshata Mishra)"

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Road dug for pipelines a year ago yet to be repaired, triggers accidents","GHAZIABAD: In March, during the general elections, residents of Ahimsa Khand in Indirapuram had put up banners that read “no roads, no vote”. Roads in the neighbourhood, near the CISF campus, had been in a shambles for months. Nine months have passed after the elections, but little has changed about the roads in Ahimsa Khand, where the risk of an accident is omnipresent. The state of the roads has also led to an increase in dust pollution. But the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) is yet to give a time line to repair the road. On Friday, a truck got stuck at CISF junction near DPS Indirapuram after part of the road caved in. The incident that took place around 3.30pm disrupted traffic for around two hours before the truck was removed and the area cleared. “It is the same stretch that had witnessed a similar incident in August after a spell of rain. The road had been shut for many days after that. Finally, the GDA carried out repair work,” said DK Pandey, a local resident. “The entire stretch is dug up and it keeps happening.

When it rains, it becomes virtually impossible to walk in the area,” he added. Kapil Singhal of Niho Scottish Society, which in the same area, said: “The problem is not new. We have been protesting about bad roads, water and sewerage problems in the area for three years now and every time there is an agitation, the GDA comes up with a plan that is never implemented properly. We pay regular charges, which are collected under several heads, but we don’t know to what effect,” Singhal added. Latest CommentFrom last many years condition is same, no improvement..RajeevSee All CommentsAdd commentAlok Kumar, a resident of Arihant Harmony, claimed old sewer lines in Indirapuram is the reason for the problem. “Sewer lines laid some two-and-a-half decade ago are redundant now. The GDA has not revamped its infrastructure, despite a manifold increase in population. As a result of that, water spills on to the roads damaging them,” said Kumar. Asked about the problem, a GDA official said: “The smaller drains connected to the societies empty into the main drain that runs parallel to CISF road. But the problem is that the main drain is on a higher plane, as a result, watre from the smaller drains does not reach the main drain. It spills on to the roads,” he said. “We have raised the height of the smaller drains and in the process, we had to dig up the roads for laying water and sewer lines. The roads are yet to be repaired properly.” "

So we have planned a pro-CAA awareness campaign in the country from January 1 to 5 where our leaders will bust the myths (about CAA) that are being deliberately spread,” Maurya said. “Again from January 6 to 15, door-to-door campaigns would be launched across the state where we plan to connect with about 50 lakh families,” he added.

SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh said the officers in the SIT would be from the crime branch as they are better equipped to handle such cases, especially since social media had played a role in inciting violence in many parts. “Till now, 122 people have been arrested and over 2,500 identified for taking part in the violent protests in Muradnagar, Kaila Bhatta and Pasonda village on December 20,” Singh said.

Initial investigation by local police has revealed that the protesters had been mobilised in the three villages through WhatsApp groups. Each of these groups had 4-5 administrators. They would be tracked down and charged for inciting violence,” he added. Despite an internet shutdown on December 20, protests against the CAA had turned violent. Police teams were attacked with stones hurled from rooftops and at least 25 officers were injured. Wary of a repeat on December 27, around 5,000 cops were deployed in the three villages and drones were engaged to keep an eye on protesters. In connection with the December 20 clash, seven FIRs for attempt to murder and violence have been lodged against rioters across five police stations.

Lucknow,Buyer knifes fish vendor to death over Rs 10 in Chinhat,"LUCKNOW: A customer knifed a fish vendor to death at Chinhat market late on Sunday afternoon when the latter refused to reduce the price of rohu by Rs 10. He was nabbed by shocked onlookers after a brief chase and handed over to police. Deceased Rakesh Kashyap (45) was a resident of Buddha Vihar in Chinhat. Police have identified the accused as Naveen Kumbhkar, a native of Chhattisgarh who now lives in Chinhat. Eyewitnesses said the bizarre attack took place around 4pm. “The buyer (Naveen) was haggling over the price of rohu. He wanted the vendor to lower the rate by Rs 10, but the latter refused and perhaps taunted him for being so petty. The infuriated man grabbed a knife from the same fish stall and attacked the vendor,” said an eyewitness. Naveen first made a lightning swipe at Rakesh’s throat and then randomly stabbed him a few times. As the vendor bled profusely, his attacker tried to flee while flashing the knife at anyone who tried to come in his way. “He was nevertheless overpowered and handed over to police. The vendor was rushed to hospital, but did not survive,” said another eyewitness.

Lucknow,More funds for discoms to light up entire Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW: In a bid to strengthen power distribution system in the state, UP government has made a fresh budgetary allocation under Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), and Deendayal Upadhyay Rural Electrification scheme (DURES). While IPDS caters to urban areas, DURES is meant for rural areas. According to a government order issued by the power department, Rs 70 crore and Rs 9.74 crore have been released for DURES and IPDS, respectively. The allocation would be made directly available to distribution companies of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited. This is being seen as a move to accelerate strengthening of power distribution system in the New Year. The budgetary allocation comes at a time when the energy department is working towards providing more power connections to rural areas under Saubhagya scheme which envisages free electricity connections to rural poor. The allocation for DURES came days after the state government released over Rs 41 crore under Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Programme.

Lucknow,New Year’s Eve in Lucknow comes at a premium,"The New Year party may be the most looked forward to event of the year but it may end up taking a toll on Lucknowites’ pockets. With a plethora of bars and hotels organising New Year events, prices of entry passes have skyrocketed over time and gone up to almost Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 for couples, with an average entry price of Rs 7000 for most parties. LT finds out the reason behind the spike in prices and how party goers in the city are reacting to them... CELEBRITY ARTISTES ARE EXPENSIVE“New Year’s Eve parties are almost 40 per cent more expensive for the guests than regular parties and it is mainly because everything becomes more expensive that day. Everybody likes to call a celebrity DJ or artiste and the main cost is of that. They charge almost double the amount they would take otherwise, because the demand is high on that day. Add to that, the extra license fee that we have to pay, coupled with extra security, all of that is passed onto the guest. Every year, on an average, the prices for the New Year's party is increased by 20 percent,” says Raj Pachauli, an event planner who has organised New Year’s Eve events at multiple hotels in the city. Rajneesh Chopra, secretary of Lucknow Golf Club, concurs, “On regular events, we can make do with local talent but the bar is high on New Year’s Eve for which we call celebrity performers and they charge a bomb. The markup in the price is to cover that cost.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.ALL INCLUSIVEWhile regular bashes at clubs and bars in the city follow a pay-as-you-order system, the cover charges for New Year’s Eve events already cover the food and alcohol costs. “The foremost thing is that all our New Year’s Eve packages are all-inclusive and unlimited. They include snacks, drinks and dinner. The security deployed is three times than that on normal occasions. So all this adds up to our cost,” says Manish Sharma, owner and founder, Molecule Air Bar. “Our package includes food and drinks. Plus, the overheads that we have to bear for NYE in the form of celebrity DJs and added security, there is a minimum surcharge for that. An extra cost goes in arranging decor and other things pertaining to the theme,” says Dheeraj Sachdeva, Vice President, First Fiddle Restaurants, which owns Lord of the Drinks and Flying Saucer in the city. (BCCL/ istock) (BCCL/ istock) In a bid to make NYE all-inclusive, hotels in the city also come up with play areas and facilities for children, which adds up to the cost. “We are focusing on an all-inclusive family experience and have set up a play area for kids also with baby sitters and caretakers. Because people look forward to New Year’s Eve the most, we have to ensure that we go all out with arrangements,” says Yashi Mishra of Hyatt Regency. IT’S ALL ABOUT NUMBERSAnother reason for the spike in prices is the fixed number of guests at the party. “We have strictly capped the event to 150 people on New Year’s Eve. The reason behind charging a premium is related to numbers. On regular days, one table is turned over three to four times, whereas on NYE, the table is reserved since 7 pm for the rest of the night, so the turn table is only one in this case. So we have to compensate it by premium pricing,” says Amol Bansal, partner, Farzi Cafe, Lucknow. PRIVATE NEW YEAR SCENES“I honestly feel NYE parties are over-priced. For me, it is more about the company I am with and the venue becomes inconsequential. In any case, people only start coming in by 10-10.30 pm and everything shuts by 1 am. So I do not get the point of paying so much for 2-3 hours. A private party can go on till whatever time we want, and because you have the whole place to yourselves, you end up having a better time,” says Aviral Jain, an entrepreneur. “I used to go out earlier for parties in the city, but since the last 2-3 years or so, I have started preferring a private scene with friends. Not only do I feel that the events are over-priced, but the crowd is overflowing and no matter how many security measures you take, you cannot avoid unscrupulous elements of society, and some incident or the other tends to happen,” says Kartikey Rastogi, a businessman who is taking a road trip with his friends for New Year’s. ECONOMICAL EVENTSWhile the majority hikes their prices, there are some places in the city who are sticking to their regular cover charges on New Year’s Eve. “There is no spike in any rates. We are charging our regular entry prices on NYE. But yes, we will be filtering out the crowd and keeping extra security to avoid any nuisance,” says Dhruv Saxena, owner of Urban Qettle. “We have not spiked rates and will be charging our regular cover charge that is fully redeemable. We are not doing a buffet or anything but instead have a special menu at usual prices. Mostly youngsters visit our bar and we want to keep it pocket-friendly and economical for them,” says Amar Singh of Munick Bar &amp; Bistro. DON’T MIND THE PREMIUM“Even though I feel New Year’s Eve events are over-priced, I do not mind paying extra since everybody waits for the year-end party and there is a lot of excitement around it. It’s a one-time cost and mostly includes everything. If we go out for a regular night of partying, we end up paying `3000-4000, so on New Year’s if you’re getting the extra advantage of a good DJ and crowd, it is fine in my opinion,” says Anuj Tiwari, a management graduate.  — Saloni Tandon "
Lucknow,PM Modi tweets Sadhguru video to drum up support for CAA,"NEW DELHI: In a social media intervention, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has begun canvassing support for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, retweeting Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev’s justification of the law that gives a path to citizenship to Hindus and five other communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The PM’s intervention is a departure from his usual tweets where he puts out policy statements, quotes and information of his meetings. The retweet of Sadhguru’s post is clearly a bid to drum up support and indicates, as reflected in his recent public speech in Lucknow, that Modi is ready to join battle with political opponents and commentators critical of CAA. In a move similar to PM Narendra Modi’s, home minister Amit Shah retweeted a post of Sadhguru to say that lies and half-truths on CAA need to be dispelled. The PM argued that the law is required to ensure a dignified life for minorities from neighbouring countries who have sought refuge in India due to religious persecution and are in no position to return to their home nations. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.“Do hear this lucid explanation of aspects relating to CAA and more by Sadhguru. He provides historical context, brilliantly highlights our culture of brotherhood. He also calls out the misinformation by vested interest groups,” Modi tweeted sharing a video of Jaggi Vasudev explaining CAA with the hashtag “IndiaSupportsCAA”. Do hear this lucid explanation of aspects relating to CAA and more by @SadhguruJV. He provides historical context… https://t.co/BljKSNMDxg— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1577684937000The retweet of a spiritual guru to drive home the government’s view on CAA was regarded with interest as the government and BJP began a major outreach over the law. BJP functionaries have said that the law does not take away any Indian’s citizenship and Muslims in the three nations cannot be regarded as “persecuted minorities”. “In my opinion, CAA is too little compassion coming too late. This bill is only focused on religious persecution. Looking at the reactions on the street, the vehemence with which people are fighting, I was wondering did I miss something. Am I not getting something here,” Sadhguru told a gathering while speaking on CAA, NRC and the protests against them. At a recent Cabinet meeting, Modi had asked colleagues to spread awareness about the new law. Joining the campaign, BJP has been organising rallies as the party shared a video showing growing support for the legislation. The Twitter handle of Modi’s personal website also had a message saying CAA is about giving citizenship to persecuted refugees and not about taking away anyone’s citizenship. It also asked people to share content, graphics and videos from the PM’s NaMo app to show their support for the new law, which has been opposed by the opposition parties with Congress taking the lead role. Shah urged everyone, especially the youngsters, to watch the video and get a “historical perspective on why we need CAA”. Party’s working president J P Nadda quoted from Sadhguru’s remarks to say “in a very calibrated way, somebody sent the message to the minorities that your citizenship is under threat, which is an absolute lie”. Union minister Prakash Javadekar countered critics who have dubbed the law as discriminatory, and tweeted, “Spread Facts Not Myth: In the last 6 years, 2,830 Pakistani, 912 Afghani &amp; 172 Bangladeshi citizens have been given Indian citizenship. Many of them are from majority community of these countries.” While senior politicians were active on social media, BJP’s Twitter handle shared a collage of several rallies taken out in different parts of the country in support of the law. The party has also launched several videos allaying fears among the Muslim community and has announced a 10-day campaign across the country. While BJP politicians are extensively campaigning in support of CAA, several organisations affiliated with the saffron fountainhead RSS, are also contributing in negating the “perception” being created by the opposition parties that the law is discriminatory. “Several organisations affiliated with RSS have launched campaigns in favour of the CAA, which has our support as they are doing it in right earnest. The issue has become highly political, hence, RSS is not involved directly with the campaign. However, individual swayamsevaks are part of it,” a senior RSS functionary said. The PM’s tweet with a hashtag #IndiaSupportsCAA was the top trend in India by 8pm, with over 9,54,000 tweets. However, a counter hashtag was also started during the day, and towards evening, there were over 1,45,000 tweets with the hashtag #IndiaDoes-NotSupportCAA. After the PM posted a video of Sadhguru explaining the benefits of CAA, his non-profit organisation, Isha Foundation, put out a poll in the form of a tweet around 2.30 in the afternoon. “Do you think the protests against CAA and NRC are justified?” the foundation asked, and provided ‘yes’ and ‘no’ as the two options. The 24-hour long poll, however, was deleted after a few hours. The final tally before the poll was deleted was over 11,000 votes, out of which 63% respondents said the protests were justified. "

Lucknow,Lucknow turns greener as tree cover up,"LUCKNOW: Green cover in Lucknow district has gone up by 13.8 sq km, according to Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR)-2019, a biennial report released by Forest Survey of India (FSI) to assess the country’s forest resources. The 2019 report is based on the satellite data collected in 2017 and early 2018. Since 2011, FSI reports have been showing an improvement in Lucknow’s green cover. Lucknow’s double-digit growth in green cover includes increase in forest cover (plantation on forest land) and tree cover (plantation on land other than forest). The report attributes the increase to plantation and conservation efforts of successive state governments. Plantation work in Kukrail and Hardoi Road has contributed majorly to the change. Besides green belts, plantation on at least 2 hectare of land in urban and 5 hectare in rural areas under the previous SP government also added to the green cover. In 2017, increase of 39sq km in green cover was recorded. "

Lucknow,Priyanka doesn’t know value of saffron: Sharma,"Lucknow: As Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra questioned chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s bhagwa or saffron robes on Monday, a war of words broke out between Congress and BJP. Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma hit out at Gandhi’s Italian lineage, saying she did not know the value of saffron because in her family “she may have learnt the culture of another country”. Sharma said that Opposition parties were desperately fighting over vote banks. “This is the attempt by Congress and SP to attract vote banks. In this example of appeasement politics, a leader of a party is actually maligning bhagwa,” he said. Sharma added that Congress seemed to be fighting BSP instead, first having propped Chandrashekhar Azad of Bhim Army, and then fighting with SP over who could say worse things in an attempt to wean away a particular vote bank. Reacting to Gandhi’s allegation that she had been manhandled by the police when she was on her way to meet the family of a detainee, Sharma said she had made false allegations against a woman police officer who had lost a relative but was still on duty. “A relative of the police officer she has falsely accused had died, but the officer still came to work because she had to protect Gandhi,” he added. Sharma said Congress was supporting those who “fired shots and from whom empty cartridges were recovered, and also those who threw stones and destroyed public property”. “By standing up for them,” he said, “Gandhi was trying to make political gains among a particular community.

It is the responsibility of writers to ensure that this does not happen,” he said. Appealing to writers to present current important issues in the country through creative ways which would inculcate feelings of public and national welfare among people, the CM said that a writer should use his thoughts, meditation and duty towards literature to establish high ideals and value of life so that society can walk on that path and dedicate themselves to society and nation.

Lucknow,No place for violence and revenge in Hinduism: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra,"LUCKNOW: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday targeted Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, saying “there is no place for violence and revenge in Hinduism”. Referring to Yogi’s warning after December 19 anti-CAA violence that rioters damaging public property will have to pay, Priyanka said: “UP CM wears ‘bhagwa’ (saffron) clothes, but it does not belong to him. It belongs to India’s religious and spiritual traditions. It’s a symbol of Hinduism and there is no place for revenge or violence in Hinduism.” Priyanka claimed it is for the first time that a CM has made such a statement and advised Yogi to “embrace Hinduism”. “India is a land of Ram and Krishna, who exemplify compassion. There is no place for violence here. This is for the first time that a CM has said such a thing. All I could tell him is to embrace Hinduism,” the Congress leader said. Drawing reference from the conversation between Krishna and Arjun in the epic Mahabharat, Priyanka said, “In the moment of war too, Krishna did not tell Arjun to take revenge from anyone,” reminding that Indians have the tradition of picking up weapons for the sake of truth only.

A number of innocent people have lost their businesses and dear ones in the violence. But, instead of standing with them, the state police is threatening them, telling them not to lodge FIRs. The conduct of the police is unlawful.” Asked to comment on the debate over her alleged security breach or traffic violation in Lucknow, Priyanka said: “My security is a non-issue and the fine imposed is a trivial matter. The safety of the common man in UP is at stake. There is anarchy, youth are unemployed while women feel insecure. These are the real issues that need attention.” "
