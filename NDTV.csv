The Chief Minister then took a holy dip at the confluence after that., Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said apart from ""all cabinet ministers"" and some junior ministers, ''sadhus"" also took the holy dip on the ""historic day""., This is the first time during Yogi Adityanath's tenure as Chief Minister that his ministers held an official meeting outside Lucknow. The move is the latest among a series of measures by the Chief Minister to hype up the festival, which is among the world's largest religious gatherings, at Prayagraj., This year's event comes at a critical time for the BJP. The national elections, due by May, are expected to be a close contest after the party lost power in three heartland states in the recent assembly elections., In Uttar Pradesh -- the 80-seater state that decides who rules in Delhi -- a twist has been added by the freshly minted alliance between Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati., Kumbh Mela is among the world's largest religious gatherings at Prayagraj., A third factor is the entry of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as the general secretary of the Congress in eastern part of the state, where lies Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency Varanasi and Yogi Adityanath's home turf Gorakhpur. The party is expecting to capture the upper caste votes that went to the BJP in 2014 general elections, during which it won 71 of the state's 80 seats., Yogi Adityanath, the biggest mascot of the BJP after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is expecting the Kumbh mela to add a vital push to the BJP campaign., The build-up has been detailed, complete with a change of name of the city from Allahabad to Prayagraj.

Lucknow,In UP ," Sources say that the decision to keep the Congress out of the alliance was primarily Mayawati's. Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati's chemistry worked in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls. (File), As the alliance between Uttar Pradesh rivals Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) gets to work for the national election ahead, the role of a new negotiator has emerged. If Mayawati's key aide SC Mishra handled the negotiations for the BSP, Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Seth was the pointsperson for Akhilesh Yadav., Sanjay Seth, 57, is a first-time parliamentarian elected to the upper house in 2016. Why Akhilesh Yadav chose him as his representative could be because the businessman is familiar with Behenji (as Mayawati is popularly called) and so, is someone trusted on both sides. Mr Seth, along with Satish Mishra, carried messages between the two leaders and were also responsible for organising their meetings., ""It is wrong to say that I played a key role. We were like secretaries, carrying out what was asked of us,'' said Mr Seth to NDTV. However, his role can't be underestimated. After all, alliance talks in Madhya Pradesh failed because Mayawati said she was unhappy, not with the Congress leadership, but with the local leaders., Sources told NDTV that the decision to keep the Congress out of the alliance was primarily Mayawati's. ""She is very upset about what happened in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan,'' said a source, and this was conveyed to the Samajwadi Party leadership early in the talks., However, Mr Seth said it was a joint decision., Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav addressed a press conference on Saturday., The idea of a tie-up crystallised last year when the two rivals saw their combined chemistry working in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls in Uttar Pradesh. The foundation for the alliance was sealed soon after the results in Kairana, where the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)'s Muslim woman candidate was backed by all and ended up winning the election. Party insiders also calculated that the Congress' voters don't usually transfer their votes to the SP or the BSP and so they were better off without the party., The Congress sees an opportunity in the snub. ""If we would have gone with them, the future of our party and cadres would have been destroyed. Here we have a chance of winning more seats,'' said a party leader., , , There has been speculation that Mr Seth's entry means the sidelining of the other Akhilesh Yadav ambassador in Delhi - his uncle Professor Ramgopal Yadav. This was dismissed by Samajwadi insiders. They point out that Professor Yadav was present in Delhi when the key alliance was sealed during Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati's meeting on the first weekend of the year., His presence in Lucknow during the announcement on Saturday was considered ""unnecessary"" as the stage only had space for the big two, said sources"

The statements made by Tejashwi Yadav against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP (during his Lucknow visit) are a result of his mental bankruptcy,"" Mr Pandey said in a statement., ""On one hand his father is in jail on charges of corruption, on the other hand he is tensed over his brother. Hence, he is unable to understand the reality of not only UP and Bihar, but the entire country. RJD has been uprooted in Bihar, hence in order to create some attraction among his supporters, he is making nonsensical remarks in UP."", Earlier on Monday, Tejashwi Yadav had targeted PM Modi at his press conference in Lucknow after meeting SP leader Akhilesh Yadav., The BJP leader said after the general election everybody will come to know who is dishonest. ""How the ''chowkidar'' has tricked the people of the country and only indulged in ''jumlebaazi''."", , , Mr Pandey said, ""Both these ''yuvraaj'' had inherited power. The people of both the states know that both of these political families were responsible for backwardness of UP and Bihar."", The UP BJP chief said, ""These people (pointing to SP and RJD) have forgotten that this is 2019, and not 1993. People have risen above casteist politics. BJP workers have reached virtually every household, and are working to integrate people from different sections of the society for nation building."
