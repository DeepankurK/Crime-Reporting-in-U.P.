Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad extends vacation till Tuesday, but not Noida","NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Taking a cue from Delhi, which ordered a shutdown of all schools till Class VIII for one week (till July 8), the Ghaziabad administration has ordered the same for two days (till July2) in wake of the severe heatwave. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari has ordered an extention of the summer vacations of schools in the district. The schools, private and government, which were supposed to open on July 1 will now reopen on July 3. Meanwhile, Gautam Budh Nagar DM B N Singh has refrained from giving any such order. “The heatwave is definitely more than it should be in July, but I have not ordered a shutdown of schools in the district,” Singh told TOI. Besides, according to Singh, the Uttar Pradesh government has initiated a one-month ‘school chalo abhiyan’ (go-to-school campaign) across the state, and it will run from July 1 to 31 across all government schools. “Shutting down schools in such a scenario will lead to a derailment of the campaign,” he said. In Ghaziabad, government schools have been asked to continue with the campaign and also hold the pre-decided rally under the initiative on July 1. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: No power in Crossings, locals spend night on road","GHAZIABAD: Some residents of the city had to bear with the deadly summer cocktail of soaring temperatures and long hours of power cuts on Saturday. The residents of GH-7 society in Crossings Republik were forced to spend the entire Saturday night on roads, parks and cars due to continuous power outage. The situation was aggravated after diesel generator sets of two towers (7 and 8) of the society malfunctioned. According to the residents, the power supply was interrupted by the electricity department in Crossings Republik from 11 pm on Saturday to 6.30 am on Sunday due to some local fault. They blamed the Crossings Infra Private Ltd (CIPL), a group of private developers who provide and maintain basic amenities in the township for a monthly payment, for its failure to provide power supply through DG sets. Vishal Tripathi, a resident, said, “There are 336 flats in towers 7 and 8 of the society, in which 1,400 people live. There was no power in the two towers for over four hours. There are several elderly people and children, who had a harrowing time on Saturday in this hot and humid weather. The CIPL is least interested to look into our problems. We kept making calls to the officials, but in vain.” Rohit Chaudhary, president of GH7, said, “The society does not have an estate manager for the past two months. The problem with the specific DG sets has been persisting for the past many years. We spoke to the CIPL’s senior officials, but no action was taken to rectify them.” Residents complained that a similar incident had taken place three weeks ago, yet DG set issue was not resolved. Kameshwar Prasad Pandey, deputy general manager (electricity), CIPL, denied the allegations that DG power supply was interrupted for four hours. “At present, DG sets are required to be switched on manually. So every time it takes around 15 minutes to start them. On Monday, we are going to replace them with automatic ones.” "
Ghaziabad,Pink letterboxes in Ghaziabad for schoolgirls,"GHAZIABAD: After pink jackets for anti-Romeo squads, Ghaziabad police have decided to install pink letterboxes in all private as well as government schools in the district, where girl students can drop anonymous complaints of harassment. Moreover, following Noida police, they are also planning to issue red cards to eve-teasers through anti-Romeo squads. SSP Upendra Kumar Agrawal said the department would study the initiative first before implementing it here. “It is a good initiative and there is no harm in implementing it. But before doing so we will study it,” the SSP said. As far as installation of letterboxes is concerned SP (City) Shlok Kumar said, “Every week school principals and the SHOs of the concerned area will open the letterboxes and go through the letters. Based on the complaints, an investigation would be done and remedial action would be taken accordingly.” Talking about the one-month special drive on girl security, SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said “Every day each of the 16 police stations will conduct an awareness class where students would be apprised about safety measures. Special teams have been formed for this purpose.” The anti-Romeo squads, which have been reactivated in the district following the order of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, will don a distinctive pink jacket with florescent strips while conducting patrolling near schools, colleges and public places at specific times during the day. In the second inning, the squads will look more organised in its functioning as specific timings have been fixed for their working. Now, each of the 16 police stations of the district has a dedicated anti-Romeo squad headed by a sub-inspector. Other members include constables and head constables. Police are also ensuring the presence of at least one female cop in the squad. UP minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, who is in-charge of Ghaziabad, took a crime review meeting on Sunday. He urged cops to maintain discipline and behave politely with the public. "

Lucknow,"Morning rain tames mercury, monsoon to hit Lucknow tomorrow","LUCKNOW: The weather went on a roller-coaster ride on Sunday with heavy premonsoon showers bringing relief in the morning, but the blistering sun returning to torment citizens along with high humidity by noon. The good news is that hot and sultry days may finally be over, as the monsoon current that was stuck over Sultanpur-Lakhimpur Kheri, around 150km from the state capital, is inching closer to the city and may tiptoe in by Tuesday. State Met director JP Gupta said a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal was likely to intensify on Monday. “It will fuel moisture incursion into the atmosphere and propel the southwest monsoon lying dormant over Sultanpur-Lakhimpur Kheri. The current will cover some more parts of the state, including Lucknow, by Tuesday-Wednesday,” he said. Sporadic pre-monsoon rain began around 6.30am and continued till 8am, with downpour for around 30 minutes in between. The maximum temperature at 36.1°C stayed well below the oppressive mark, but relative humidity at 84% kicked up the the discomfort index (DI) to 34.1 degrees. In Met parlance, it is “severe” and “detrimental to health”. The DI at night was 21.1 degrees. No significant change in temperatures is expected on Monday. The maximum will hover around 37°C and minimum around 23°C degrees Celsius, although there are possibilities of another round of pre-monsoon showers, besides partly cloudy skies. Light to moderate rainfall is expected on Tuesday and Wednesday while widespread and heavy showers have been predicted for Thursday. Power pangs amid premonsoonshowers:The showers triggered marathon power cuts in areas like Husainganj, Charbagh, Lalbagh, Kaiserbagh, Wazirganj, Victoria Street, Shahmeena Road, Aishbagh, Mawwaiya, some parts of Gomtinagar, Aliganj, Purania and many adjoining areas. Lesa chief engineer Madhukar Verma said: “There was a power shutdown for few minutes in some areas, which was due to ongoing renovation work.” "
Lucknow,What’s vulgarity? Panel to find out yet to be formed,"LUCKNOW: Though the district administration on Saturday, reaffirmed its four-year old stand on “no-vulgarity in clothing or activity” inside Imambara premises to honour the religious sanctity of the historic Shia shrine, its promise to clerics and Shia community that a committee will be set up to hammer out decency norms still rings hollow. On June 26, 2015, after the 20-day stir led by Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawaad, seeking a dress code at the Bada and Chhota Imambara among other demands, it was announced that a verbal agreement had been reached on forming an Imambara Committee. The panel was supposed to include senior Shia clerics, historians and members of the Awadh royal family to decide on do’s and don’ts inside the 235-year-old Imambara, including dress norms. But, after four years, no such committee was formed and the decency quotient remains fuzzy. Talking to TOI on Sunday, Maulana Kalbe Jawad, said, “IAS officer Navneet Sehgal and then district magistrate (DM) Raj Shekhar, had assured us that a committee will be formed. However, nothing was done. I was never consulted on any decision on the Imambaras. We demand that norms followed in Delhi’s Jama Masjid and Amritsar’s Golden Temple, where tourists are cover their heads and legs, should also be enforced at Imambaras, which are our live religious monuments.” However, the district magistrate, Kaushal Raj Sharma, said, while the committee is yet to be formed, necessary action is being taken. “Even without a committee, we have been doing the needful. We are aware of cleanliness and maintenance issues. And we keep getting letters and suggestions from people and we take note of them.” He also said, “It would be controversial to make such a committee since the Shia community has several clerics, many of whom hold opposing views. The monuments are a trust of the government and we are taking good care of them.” The district administration is currently in control of the Husainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) which was a Nawabi-era body formed to look into management of monuments in the Husainabad area.

Lucknow,"Dress code fuzzy: Day after DM’s order, confusion rules","LUCKNOW: In the absence of any written order by district administration on the dress code and no clarity over the definition of ‘decency’, confusion prevailed among tourists visiting the Bada Imambara on Sunday. Some heated arguments between tourists and guides kept happening throughout the day with some returning home disappointed. The district administration later said that a final order on what is ‘decent’, will be issued in few days and put on boards at various spots in Imambara. Tourists arriving at Imambara were checked by Husainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) employees for inappropriate clothes. When the employees were asked to produce a written order, they failed to produce any. Guides at the main hall entrance which leads to shahnasheen (sanctum sanctorum), were seen handing out dupattas to tourists for covering their heads while entering the hall. Mubashir Ali, a worker, told TOI, “Heads are to be covered ever since an agitation was launched in 2015. But yesterday, we were been asked to be extra vigilant since the district administration’s meeting and the fact that action will be taken against employees if obscenity is reported anywhere in Imambara.” District magistrate, Kaushal Raj Sharma, who is also the ex-officio chairperson of HAT, said, “Everyone is expected to maintain decency while entering a mosque, temple or gurdwara, and the same is expected of tourists coming to Bada Imambara. The emotional religious value of Imambara cannot be overlooked, we have to find a balance.” “There is no dress code but tourists,both men andwomen, wearing shorts or skirts will be denied entry. Covering head is optional since we cannot enforce any orthodox rule to tick away tourists,” he added. (With inputs from Niba Mirza) "

Many of those called for quizzing are UPPSC toppers, currently deputy collectors or posted at UP Secretariat. The investigating agency is probing discrepancies in exams conducted during the tenure of Akhilesh Yadav between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2017. APS recruitment is the only exam which started during Mayawati’s stint as the notification was issued when she was CM, but the exam was held in 2016. CBI has sent summons through e-mail and post from its Delhi-based headquarters after a week-long investigation at UPPSC office in Allahabad. The probe team headed by additional superintendent of police Chandradeep will be questioning the officers from Monday. Also, UPPSC employees involved in recruitments from 2012 to 2017 and the complainants have also been summoned. They have been asked to carry documents to justify their claims and allegations. The candidates who successfully cleared the Combined State Upper Subordinate Examination-2015 or PCS-2015, PCS-2011, review officer/assistant review officer exam-2014 and Lower State Upper Subordinate Examination-2013 have been called for questioning. “We need clarifications on pattern of symbols used in answer scripts revealing identity of candidates and the moderation/scaling methodology adopted by UPPSC in the civil services test. They cannot be termed accused, but it’s expected truth will come out after questioning,” said an official. Sources said, the successful candidates are required to divulge income details before and after the exams, their contacts with commission officials, conversations on phone or any link with a political family. The CBI team took away three van loads of documents and answer scripts after investigation in the administrative and examination sections of the commission till Saturday late night.

Lucknow,Biodiversity parks along Ganga in 27 districts to battle pollution in lifeline,"LUCKNOW: Cleaning Ganga through phytoremediation is what the Yogi government has on its mind. It is a lowcost, solar energy-driven technique that uses plants to remove pollutants from water. To clean a river, the water must be channelled through boulders to filter it and then held up in retention ponds. These ponds have certain naturally growing plant species that help increase the level of dissolved oxygen in water. The government, following directives from National Green Tribunal, has preliminarily identified sites in at least 22 of the 27 districts through which the Ganga flows. Biodiversity parks complete with retention ponds will be developed at these sites, which are also likely to boast tourist attractions such as nature trails and butterfly parks. “The parks will be along the banks of Ganga,” said member-secretary, UP Pollution Control Board, Ashish Tiwari and added that retention ponds would be fenced off to thwart unwanted interference in phytoremediation. The state pollution watchdog is expected to submit a detailed project report (DPR) on biodiversity parks in all the 27 concerned districts by August. Before that and acting on NGT orders, the government will notify the floodplain area of Ganga by July 15. A floodplain is the maximum area that a river has flooded in 25 years. Though the river may not rise that high every year, demarcating it in a way marks the area that a river may engulf. The area also needs protection against squatters. The irrigation department and the Central Water Commission conducted a survey to demarcate Ganga’s floodplain in the state. Once the area is marked and notified, not only will it help remove encroachment but also define activities that will be illegal in the area. It may result in more space for biodiversity parks that are meant to generate awareness. The parks will be developed by the forest department. In several districts, the department has its own land. For instance in Moradabad, a deer park on the banks of Ramganga can be further developed into a biodiversity park. "
Kanpur,UP: BJP internal survey to track those who sabotaged party in LS polls,"LUCKNOW: While gearing up for the much-anticipated membership drive, BJP in Uttar Pradesh has begun an internal survey to identify and expel those who indulged in anti-party activity during the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections. The party bagged 62 seats against its target of 74, despite SPBSP forging a pre-poll alliance. The party brass sought a report from different districts to identify party functionaries — many of whom were denied tickets — who worked against party line to restrict BJP from winning more seats. The internal survey covers sitting BJP MLAs and MPs, who instead of doing their bit, tried to sabotage chances. BJP denied tickets to a number of sitting MPs in the run-up to Lok Sabha elections. Confirming the development, UP BJP vice-president JPS Rathore said reports have been sought from all districts. He said even after 2017 UP assembly elections, when BJP got an overwhelming mandate, the party expelled 87 members and issued notices to 303 party functionaries for not adhering to party norms. “It’s on the high command to take action,’’ said Rathore. The BJP versus BJP battle was being fought in over 12 constituencies where the party denied tickets to sitting MPs, who not only held demonstrations in their constituencies, but also wrote to the party high command. While two BJP MPs Ashul Varma from Hardoi, and Shyama Charan Gupta from Allahabad, joined SP after being denied tickets, Ashok Dohre joined Congress. BJP denied tickets to 16 sitting MPs and changed constituencies of four MPs. The MPs denied tickets include Satyapal Saini (Sambhal) , Nepal Singh (Rampur), Rajesh Diwakar (Hathras) , Chaudhary Babu Lal (Fatehpur Sikri) , Krishna Raj (Shahjahanpur), Anshul Varma (Hardoi), Anju Bala (Misrikh), Ashok Dohre (Etawah), M M Joshi (Kanpur), Uma Bharti (Jhansi) , Shyama Charan Gupta (Allahabad), Priyanka Rawat (Barabanki) , Savitri Bai Phule (Bahraich) , Rajesh Pandey (Kushinagar), Kalraj Misra (Deoria) and Bharat Singh (Ballia).

Lucknow,UP bypolls: Where the die is 'caste',"LUCKNOW: The process to issue caste certificates to members of the 17 MBCs, which were included in the SC list, could not have come at a more appropriate time in Uttar Pradesh, though the issue was raised for the first time in 2005 and remained mired in controversy. The move is likely to give the BJP an edge in the upcoming assembly bypolls in 12 constituencies in the state in the wake of several MLAs getting elected to the Lok Sabha in the recent parliamentary elections, say political observers. The 17 OBC castes that have been included in the Scheduled Caste list are Nishad, Bind, Mallah, Kewat, Kashyap, Bhar, Dhivar, Batham, Machua, Prajapati, Rajbhar, Kahar, Kumhar, Dhimar, Manjhi, Turaha and Gaudia. A directive issued by the the UP administration says caste certificates will be issued after thorough verification, a move that could steal the opposition's thunder, especially of the SP and the BSP which have tried to sympathise with these 17 Most Backward Classes (MBC) in the past by attempting to bring them in the SC bracket. These MBC groups constitute nearly 13 per cent of the total backward population in the caste-politics dominated state and can make or mar the electoral prospects of a party or candidate. The missive was sent to all divisional commissioners and district magistrates by Principal Secretary Manoj Singh instructing them to comply with a 2017 Allahabad High Court order which said caste certificates being issued to people belonging to these 17 categories will be that of Scheduled Caste ""subject to outcome of an ongoing writ petition"". The district officials have been asked to start the process of issuing caste certificates to these most backward castes that have been included in the SC list by the Yogi Adityanath government. The Adityanath government had been trying to put the 17 other backward castes in the SC list for a long time. The reason given was that these castes figured very low on the social and economic indices. Being in the other backward class category had not improved their standard of living and the objective was to bring them under the SC list. A senior official explained that the direct advantage of putting them in the SC category will entitle them to reservation quota and other benefits announced by the government from time to time. Earlier, then SP and BSP governments too had made efforts in this regard, but did not succeed. It was in 2005 that the issue was raised for the first time when the then Mulayam Singh Yadav government had issued an order to this effect. It was seen as the SP stalwart's ploy to win over the 17 MBCs who felt left out and neglected in the backward quota as the pie went to the creamy layer of the dominant Yadav, Kurmi and Lodhis in government schemes and programmes, as well as admission in educational institutions. But, the order ran into rough weather when the high court stayed it following which the proposal was sent to the Centre. Two years later, when Mayawati came to power, she rejected the proposal but later wrote to the Centre extending her support. The Akhilesh Yadav government revived the move again in December 2016 and the proposal was cleared by the state cabinet ahead of the UP Assembly elections. A formal request to include these 17 castes was sent to the Centre, but the matter somehow got stuck with the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. While hearing a Public Interest Litigation moved by Gorakhpur-based Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar Granthalaya Evam Jan Kalyan, which fights for SC rights, challenging the government decision, the court had made it clear that any caste certificate issued will be subject to the outcome of the writ petition. Scheduled Caste groups apprehend that the move of the Adityanath government might dent their quota as the new entrants would consume their share if their reservation limit was not expanded. "
Lucknow,"‘Was beaten black &amp; blue, cop crushed my fingers with boot’","LUCKNOW: He still can’t stand stable and starts shuddering on being asked to recall the nightmare he faced in a police station lock-up. Manish Kumar (14) is unable to walk, and is currently admitted in the orthopaedics ward of Civil hospital. The boy was picked by the police while probing an erickshaw theft. He had taken that e-rickshaw on rent and earned his livelihood from it. However, it got stolen and the owner lodged a complaint with the police which made boy a suspect. His father, Ram Kumar, a labourer, mother Shanti Devi and elder brother Ashish Kumar are by his side, the sibling seething in anger against police highhandedness. Manish says, “Police took metoPGI policestation put me in lock-up and beated me black and blue. The two-hour torture will torment me whole life.” “On June 27, around 6pm, there was a knock on the door. My mother opened it and saw cops standing. She came inside and told me that they had come to inquire. As soon as I went outside, they pushed me into a jeep and took me away,” he said. One policeman came and told me to confess that I had stolen an e-rickshaw. He returned after 20 minutes and asked me, but I refused,” he added. “Then it started. Three cops came inside the lock-up, pushed me and then kept hitting me in my leg with a stick for over 20 minutes and posed the same question again. When I again answered in a ‘no’, a cop crushed my fingers with his boots and thrashed me brutally,” said Manish and he started weeping again. Shanti intervened, “I prostrated before the SHO of SGPGI police station and pleaded him to release my innocentson.” “The police released me around 8pm,” added Manish. "
Lucknow,"MBCs happy with quota move, SCs feel it will eat into their pie","LUCKNOW: The most backward castes (MBCs) in Uttar Pradesh, who have been looking at an uncertain future, are now happy to have found a place in the Scheduled Caste category. On Friday, the UP government decided to include 17 categories of MBCs, which comprise nearly 14 per cent of MBCs, under the Scheduled Caste umbrella following a 2017 Allahabad high court order. Various commissions and committees, over the last 50 years, have recommended to the state government that there were certain most backward castes which were being denied the fruits of reservation, hence necessitating a quota-within-quota policy for their focussed development and uplift. However, government in the past have not dared to do this, fearing a backlash. “This is a historic decision as there are a number of castes in the MBC category which are living in an inferior socio-economic condition as compared to SCs. The Yogi government’s decision will end their exploitation,” said SPS Baghel, who was dairy development minister before being elected as an MP in the recent general elections. Dharambir Prajapati, chairman of the Maati Kala Board, said that the decision would revolutionise the socio-economic lives of the MBCs as they had been struggling since decades to get settled. “In the wake of technological advances and introduction of plastic products, lakhs of potters from the Kumhar caste have been rendered idle as earthen pots were discarded and replaced with plastic and paper products,” said Prajapati. BJP vice-president Prashant Pal also welcomed the government’s decision by saying that no government had ever looked into the problems of castes in the backward categories which were dependent on their occupations like fishing, boating, pottery and other such livelihoods that are being hit by modern techonology. Contrary to this enthusiasm and jubilation in the MBC camp, mood in the SC category is of anger and resentment, as it fears that reservation for them would be shared by more people within that limit. Bhawan Nath Paswan, national president of Dr Ambedkar Rashtriya Ekta Manch and vice-president of the SC, Backward and Minorities Employees Federation’, warned that it would be opposed until the quota for the SCs was not expanded. RK Chaudhary, a Congress leader and formerly a BSP stalwart, said that unless the reservation limit for SCs was increased to 32 per cent, the move will hit the SC population. "

The locals then alerted police who took the injured to a hospital. ""An FIR has been lodged and searches are underway to arrest the accused. The victim's medical examination has been conducted,"" said police. "
Lucknow,It feels good to hear that now people are also raising their voice for the men: Bidita Bag,"Actress Bidita Bag, who shot to fame with the film Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, was in Lucknow, recently. Here for personal commitments, Bidita talks about why #Mentoo movement is necessary, about being choosy regarding roles, her obsession with Lakhnavi chikan and more. Bidita visited a local chikan shop on her recent visit (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Bidita visited a local chikan shop on her recent visit (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Having been to Lucknow several times, Bidita has a special liking not only for the local food but also for Lakhnavi chikan. Reminiscing about how she fell in love with the traditional embroidery style from Lucknow, she shares, ""The first chikan sari I ever saw was my mother’s as a kid. Since then I have been in love with Lakhnavi chikan."" ""Later, when I stepped into the fashion industry, I came to know that several big designers buy chikan fabric from Lucknow. And after little modifications or say styling, they label it and sell it as their own. I found that very interesting and always thought of coming to Lucknow and buying chikan. Babumoshai Bandookbaaz gave me that opportunity and I remember buying a yellow sari and wearing the same sari I had gone to meet the then CM of UP,"" adds Bidita. Since then, the T for Taj Mahal actress has developed an obsession for buying chikan clothes whenever she is in Lucknow. She says, ""Uske baad se toh jo mujhe chikan ke kapde khareedne ki latt lagi hai, ki ek almirah poora ussi se bhara hua hai. Kuch 8-10 white saris ke alaava mere pass saare pastel shades hain. Jab bhi Lucknow aati hoon, dekhti hoon kuchh naya style mil raha hai chikan mein. So every time I come here my budget for chikan clothes has been going up."" A popular actress in Bengali cinema, Bidita has been doing meaningful roles and has been selective about offers coming her way. ""I have a very simple logic when it comes to choosing roles, the films which I would not like to go and watch, I am not going to do such films even if I get more money for it. Mann nahi maanta."" ""I prefer doing content-driven films. That’s why I choose subjects which are interesting, but then not everything is in our hands, sometimes subject bhi hamein chunte hain,"" she says. Having been vocal about the #Metoo movement, Bidita, who has been part of the fashion industry also, comes out in full support of the #Mentoo movement too. ""While there is no doubt about the efficacy of the #Metoo movement, as it has happened with most females in India, from a 6 month-child to a 100-year-old lady, at some point or the other. But I think #Mentoo is also necessary because men are also victims of fake rape cases, harassment and even their friends laugh at them when they reveal to them, 'ki yaar ladki tere saath aisa kar sakti hai, tujhe toh enjoy karna chahiya tha'. So ladke hi ladkon ko seriously nahi lete. I know many such boys, especially in fashion industry, where they face so much exploitation. Uske baare mein toh kai ladke baat bhi nahi karte hain. But aisa hota hai, film industry mein bhi hota hai and corporates mein bhi. It feels good to hear that now people are also raising their voice for the men. Main apne ko feminist nahi, manist kehti hoon kyunki mujhe lagta hai ki jab ladkiyon ke liye ladke awaaza uthane lagenge and vice versa hoga, tabhi gender equality possible hai,"" says Bidita as she signs off.

Kanpur,"Book land grabbers, send them to jail: DM to officials","KANPUR: The district administration on Monday directed the officials to lodge FIRs against those grabbing government land and send them to jail. Addressing a review meeting, district magistrate (DM) Vijay Vishwas Pant told the officials to launch a comprehensive campaign against big land sharks, free government land from their possession and sent them to jail. He also asked the officials of various government departments to prepare a list of illegal possessions on their lands and take action against the encroachers. In a specific direction to KDA officials, the DM asked them to fence the land which was cleared from encroachers and lodge FIR against habitual trespassers and encroachers. Pant also directed lodging of FIRs against those who had prepared forged documents and sold government land. The DM said he had received several complaints of illegal possession on Awas Vikas land. When Awas Vikas officials told him that there were no such incidents, the DM constituted a committee headed by additional district magistrate (finance &amp; revenue) to look into the matter. The DM also ordered stern action against those illegally occupying government graze-yards, ponds, chak road, barren land and gram samaj land. He directed the ADM (finance &amp; revenue) to prepare a list in a couple of days depicting how much land was to be vacated from land grabbers and what action would be taken. Besides SSP Anant Deo, CDO Akshay Tripathi, ADM (finance &amp; revenue) Virendra Pathak, SDMs of Sadar, Bilhaur, Narval and officials of irrigation department, KDA and Awas Vikas were present in the meeting. Meanwhile, over seven kilograms of prohibited polythene was seized by official teams on Monday and a penalty of Rs 8,000 was realized. The district administration had launched an anti-polythene campaign in the city last month and set up as many as 32 teams to conduct raids. "
Lucknow,"As Delhi University dreams fade, many mull skipping one year","LUCKNOW: Stuti Sharma scored a commendable 94% in her Class XII boards and is yet unlikely to make it to any reputable college under Delhi University (DU), which released its first list with high cutoffs on Thursday. Stuti, who wants to study political science, now regrets not taking admission to St Xavier’s College, Kolkata. “The DU cutoffs are not only higher than last year, but were also declared late. Admissions at most prominent institutes in other parts of the country are already over. This leaves me with no choice. I have to either settle for an average college or skip a year,” she rued. The teenager is not alone in her predicament. Several other students who did not have a Plan B up their sleeves are finding themselves in the lurch, given DU’s high cutoffs especially in humanities and commerce subjects. Most are inclined to skip a year. “I was confident of making it to the first list because last year, a student with 95% had secured a political science berth in a good college. This time, however, DU has increased cutoffs in the subject by 2% on an average,” said Abhijit Sharma, who scored 95% in Class XII and is now keeping fingers crossed for the second and third cutoffs lists. Since DU released its list very late and after declaration of engineering and medical exam results, Mudit Agnihotri was hopeful that the cutoffs would dip. The high ceiling, particularly for Hindu College and Hansraj College, has left him shattered. “It will be a great disappointment if I don’t get into DU. I’ve got all my hopes pinned on the second list. Else, I may have to drop out this year,” said Mudit who scored 93.75% and wants to pursue physics honours. Adarsh Maurya is no less disappointed. “All my plans have fallen through. The first cutoffs list is a big blow to my ambition of becoming a writer. The cutoffs for English are extremely high. I won’t be able to study in any prestigious DU college,” said Adarsh who got 93.25% in Class XII. Economics aspirant Manasvi Chauhan has failed to clear the cutoffs at Kirori Mal College by 1%. The teenager who scored 96% in Class XII says she has little expectations from the second cutoffs list either. “I am looking at opportunities abroad. If I find none, I may skip the year.” "
Lucknow,Why ordinary BA from Delhi University is a huge hit in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: Harleen Singh could not clear the Delhi University cutoffs for honours in economics and English, the subjects of her choice. She has settled for an ordinary BA course at Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College only to fulfil her dream of studying in the North Campus. “I am no Alice, but that campus is my wonderland. I’ve always wanted to study there,” said the 18-year-old who scored 91.5% in her Class XII boards. This year, the highest cutoff for the BA programme is 98.75%, set by Lady Sri Ram College for Women, while the lowest is 72% at Bhagini Nivedita College. “With 91.5% in my best four subjects, admission to a North Campus college seemed a wishful thought. Nevertheless, I cleared the first cutoffs for Khalsa college’s BA programme comprising economics and mathematics. Since the cutoffs for ordinary BA is low compared to other courses, it is the most preferred course of many students who want to live the DU dream,” she said. Harleen isn’t the only one who has made a tough choice. Many youngsters have opted for pass programmes rather than honours course just to bag a berth in DU. Suryanshi Bharadwaj couldn’t control her excitement as she spoke to TOI about getting into Miranda House-University College for Women. “I always wanted to be part of the institution. I had applied for political science honours. But, since the cutoff is very high, I am enrolling in a BA programme with hindi and political science. Miranda House has been securing top ranks in the National Institutional Ranking Framework for three years,” said the student who scored 90% and wants to crack civil services. "
Lucknow,Dates out: UP Board exams from February 18,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board on Monday released the detailed schedule for class 10 and 12 board examinations. This was the first occasion when the UP Board released the board schedule on the first day of the new academic session. As per the schedule released by UP deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, board examinations will begin on February 18 next year. More than 55 lakh candidates will appear in these examinations. While class 10 exams will last for 12 days and end on March 3, class 12 exams will continue for 15 days, with the last paper scheduled on March 6. The examinations will be held in two shifts — 8am to 11.15am and from 2pm to 5.15pm Deputy CM Sharma, who is also the state secondary education minister, told reporters: “The answer copies will be evaluated from March 15 to March 25. The number of the evaluators will be increased at every examination centre so that results are declared between April 20 and 25.” In 2019, board examinations had begun on February 7.

Lucknow,Dig a pit to get free sapling for plantation drive,"LUCKNOW: ‘No pit, no plant’ will be one of the base rules to ensure probity in state government’s plantation drive this year as it plans to distribute 15 crore saplings free of cost to farmers, MNREGA job card holders and beneficiaries of various central government schemes like Saubhagya, PMAY, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana among others. The government scheme beneficiaries will have to plant at least five trees each. Each state nursery sapling costs minimum Rs 7, hence giving away 15 crore saplings free will cost around Rs 105 crore to the state exchequer. Since it involves huge expenditure, the departments that distribute saplings will ensure fairness and set accountability by recording sapling given free. Besides, the beneficiaries will have to dig pits and produce a document signed by an officer certifying the same to collect free saplings. This year, UP has set the most ambitious plantation target ever — planting 22 crore trees in 2019-20. Inaugurating Van Mahotsav, a week-long annual plantation drive from July 1 to July 7 at Kukrail reserve forest on Monday, forest minister Dara Singh Chauhan said 22 crore trees will be planted on August 15. Out of 22 crore trees, forest department will plant seven crore on forest land, while remaining 15 crore will be planted by 23 other departments collectively. The trees planted during Van Mahotsav will be over and above the 22 crore target. Rural development department has been assigned plantation of 10 crore saplings. Gram Rozgar Sewaks, who are appointed on contract by government at Gram Panchayat level for smooth implementation of MNREGA, will work as ‘tree guardian’ to oversee plantation drive and monitor the growth and survival of trees for a year. Panchayats and urban local bodies will be geo-tagged to check status of plantation. Yogi government has been setting ambitious targets as it aims to increase state’s green cover from 9.1% to 15%. In 2018, 11.2 crore trees were planted against six crore in 2017. "
Lucknow,"BJP leader joins Mayawati, terms government order on OBCs in SC list ‘unconstitutional’","LUCKNOW: Soon after BSP supremo Mayawati slammed the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday for including 17 OBCs in Scheduled Caste category, terming it unconstitutional and demanding its withdrawal, a senior BJP leader also criticized the step saying it should have been done after getting a ‘recommendation’ of SC/ST commission. Ex-chairman of SC/ST commission and former Rajya Sabha MP, Bizay Sonkar Shastri, who is BJP spokesperson, said that the move by Yogi Adityanath government is against the Constitution. “Many Dalit leaders within BJP are not happy with this decision. I don’t want to comment beyond this,” Shastri said, while speaking to TOI on phone from Delhi. Shastri’s statement came hours after Mayawati attacked state government’s step saying it intended to cheat OBCs and SCs ahead of UP bypolls for 12 assembly seats. No state government can include any caste in SC list as under Article 341 of Indian Constitution, only Centre can do so, she said. “The state government knows this very well and hence its intention is exposed. These castes will neither get 27% OBC reservation nor of SC. They would rather be considered in general category,” she said, adding that the government knew that similar orders in past had been quashed by high court. Last week, UP government had added 17 castes, including Kashyap, Mallah, Kumhar, Rajbhar, Prajapati and others, in Scheduled Castes list. “My party had protested a similar order passed by previous Samajwadi Party regime. In 2007, when we were in power, we had written to Congress-led UPA government at Centre demanding increase in quota for SCs before including the 17 OBC castes in SC category,” she said. “I had also raised this demand in parliament, but neither the UPA government nor NDA intend to ensure that both OBC and SC people get benefited,” Mayawati said. She alleged that the order was issued for political gains with an eye on bypolls for 12 seats. “I appeal government not to cheat OBCs and take back the order which is unconstitutional. At the same time, Centre should follow due procedure to put the 17 OBC castes in SC category and increase SC quota in the same ratio so that the existing beneficiaries do not suffer any problem,” she added.

Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh adds 16 lakh entrepreneurs to GST regime as collection soars,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh has registered 19.28% growth over last year’s collection in the goods and services tax (GST). The state’s GST collection for 2018-19 financial year stands at Rs 70,060 crore. Also, as many as 16.5 lakh new businessmen have become part of the GST regime in UP since 2017. These disclosures were made by the UP GST office at the commemoration of two years of indirect tax’s implementation by the NDA government. The event in Lucknow was presided by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, finance minister Rajesh Aggarwal, Lucknow zone principal chief commissioner (GST) Rajeev Tandon, and joint commissioner (GST) Vivek Jain. “The fact that GST collections are on the rise indicates that the tax base is widening gradually with stablity along with measures, such as e-way bills and people are also readily paying their arrears,” said Aggarwal. Both Jain and Tandon hailed GST as goods and “simplified” tax. The officials said that more than 200 commodities have seen a significant drop in GST, but their sales in both rural and urban areas have increased by more than 46 %, thereby adding to overall tax collection. The commodities range from four-wheelers, electronic goods to hospitality industry as well as aviation. In 2017-18, UP’s GST collection stood at 58,738 crore, while in 2016-17 it was Rs 51,819 crore. At least four times in the last financial year, the GST collections in UP were a touch short of Rs 7,000 crore. On the occasion, Yogi said his government’s target for GST would be Rs 1 lakh crore while also insisting that his government was trying to bargain hard with retailers and new entrepreneurs to use softwares to subscribe to GST regime. Since December 2018, the UP government, on recommendation of GST Lucknow zone, has made introduction of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Tag) electronic tag mandatory on heavy vehicles carrying goods, thereby restricting tax fraud but at the same time facilitating ease of business.

Lucknow,Gomtinagar gangs pull off a hat-trick,"LUCKNOW: Empty homes in Gomtinagar have become soft targets of burglar gangs who are taking full advantage of owners being either on vacation or business trips and police being lax as ever. Unidentified persons went on a break-in spree in the small hours of Monday, targeting three flats — one of them possibly owned by a DSP-rank officer — at Greenwood Apartments and taking the total number of burglaries in the posh city neighbourhood to nine in a little over a month. However, they were unable to bag a huge booty. According to preliminary investigation, the gang scaled the around 8ft boundary wall of the apartment complex while guards kept vigil at the gates, removed corridor bulbs in one of the six towers and broke into a flat on the second floor and two more on the fifth floor. All were empty with their owners away for either work or pleasure. While other residents did not hear any startling noise, a CCTV camera on the ground floor caught two persons in shorts and T-shirts entering the building around 3am. “We suspect they are the gang or at least part of the gang,” said SP, North, Sukirti Madhav. Flat 205, neighbours said, belongs to DSP Rama Shankar who has rented it out to one Akash Shukla, a native of Basti. Since Shukla also stays here occasionally, the burglars apparently did not find much to steal. At 501, owned by retired executive engineer of UP Housing Board Ramakant, the gang was again unlucky. “They rummaged through the wardrobe and at best took away Rs 5,000 in cash from the pocket of my trousers,” Ramakant told TOI. His wife and he were away visiting a relative at Rajajipuram. “When I reached home this morning, I found the burglars had broken the door open perhaps becasue they could not pick the lock,” he added. Flat 508 is owned by one Rajiv Ranjan who along with his family is away in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. Police are trying to ascertain the losses. Ramakant has lodged a complaint while we are waiting for the others to do so, said a policeman. "
Lucknow,‘My daughter’s dead; her killer is still out there’,"LUCKNOW: What is more painful for a father than losing his dear girl whom he allowed to leave hometown for higher education? It is perhaps watching her killer roam scot-free while police take a nap. On June 11, final-year dental science student Priya Singh (25) was found dead at her residence in Nilmatha under Cantonment thana, a mark around her neck and circumstantial evidence pushing the needle of suspicion towards murder than suicide. A day later, her father Prakash Singh — a civil engineer in Bihar — lodged an FIR against one Prakash Chandra Arya, a guy who wanted to marry Priya. Three weeks down the line, her bereaved parents claim police are sitting on the case. “No effort has been made to secure a non-bailable warrant against the accused, let alone track him down. We believe he is in New Delhi, where he was last seen withdrawing money from an ATM some two-three days after my daughter was killed,” the father told TOI. Singh said they were more than willing to co-operate in the investigations. “I have shared every bit of information possible. I have visited the Cantonment police station several times in these few weeks and waited there for hours at a stretch to meet the investigation officer. I have met senior police officers too. All I get is empty promises,” he said. While the exhausted father wants police to at least issue a lookout notice against Arya without delay, grieving mother Renu has hardly stayed away from her prayer room. “I have lost faith in police. I am praying to God so that the person who did this to my child is not spared,”Priya’s mother told TOI between sobs and sniffles. "
Lucknow,Grisly June: Lucknow witnessed a crime every three hours,"LUCKNOW: A businessman enjoying a family vacation returned home to Gomtinagar to find footprints in blood all over his house and valuables missing. A woman in Chinhat took a bullet because her husband thought she nagged him too much over his fetish for felony. And, two Mahanagar women had their gold turned into pebbles in minutes by men who said they were cops. These cases form only the tip of an iceberg of crimes that the city witnessed in June. If police files are anything to go by, as many as 236 cases of murder, burglary, rape, snatching, con and more have taken place in Lucknow in a month, which effectively means the state capital witnessed a crime every three hours and at least eight every day. Between June 1and 30, there have been eight murders, three shootings, six rapes, 45 cases of snatching, 22 burglaries and 21 incidents of con to mock police claims of routine city patrolling and their ambitious Jaagte Raho campaign to prevent crimes in the dead of night.

The administration should realise that such lip service can hardly be useful in arresting the rise of crime in the city. The police department should launch concrete steps like monitoring roads with a network of CCTV cameras to check crime. The move has yielded useful results in countries which use surveillance footage to keep a tab on criminals.Between June 1 and 30, there have been eight murders, three shootings, six rapes, 45 cases of snatching, 22 burglaries and 21 incidents of con to mock police claims of routine city patrolling and their ambitious Jaagte Raho campaign to prevent crimes in the dead of night.

Anxious citizens mull private securityAlmost convinced that police can no longer protect the city, some enterprising residents like Khurramnagar jeweller Santosh Singh have decided to hire private security. “I was robbed of cash and jewellery worth over a lakh on June 23 on my way home to Jankipuram. Despite being a prime location, there were no UP 100 patrol vehicles. I am looking for private guards,” he told TOI. Shikha Tiwari of Mahanagar who was robbed of her gold chain and bangles at gunpoint near the Cantonment CO’s office at noon on June 3 said she was advising friends and family members to not wear or carry valuables when commuting alone. “The city has become unsafe and police are doing precious little (to curb crimes). It is up to us to stay safe,” she said. Lucknow SSP Kalanidhi Naithani made an attempt to defend his forces. “Most of the serious cases have been solved. Also, vulnerable areas (where cons and loots take place) have been identified. These areas will be geo-tagged for better patrolling by UP 100 vehicles,” he said. "

Relatives and neighbours were waiting for Furqan’s body to arrive from the private hospital where he was admitted on June 21 after an accident, and was declared dead by doctors on Monday. Sobs could be heard when the ambulance arrived, but in a shocking development that looked like straight out of a movie scene, Furqan’s body showed movement while being taken out. As family members, relatives and several mourners had seen the movement, the glum atmosphere soon turned into one of bewilderment.

The movie He Ganga Maiya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo was the first ever Bhojpuri film to be made and screened in India starring noted actor Nazir Hussain. It was made on request of then President Rajendra Prasad. “The entire Bhojpuri speaking community is thankful to the prime minister for putting thrust on the backward areas of UP. From trains to airports to hospitals to, my request to PM is now that the same community has only another hope from him. Which is to see the language getting included in the 8th schedule,” said Kishan. Kishan was roped in by the BJP in 2017 to swing Purvanchali assembly constituencies in saffron party's favour during the Assembly elections and later made a candidate this year in Lok Sabha polls from UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath's home turf Gorakhpur. His victory is significant as BJP had lost the Gorakhpur bypoll for the first time in five decades last year to Samajwadi Party but the Bhojpuri cinestar secured a win for the party by a margin of three-lakh votes in a high decibel campaign that saw BJP president Amit Shah, Union minister Smriti Irani campaigning for him. 22 languages part of 8th scheduleAs of now, 22 languages are part of the 8th schedule which includes Hindi.

Lucknow,Clues elude cops in trader’s murder near Durgapuri,"LUCKNOW: A day after a trader was shot dead and Rs 2 lakh looted from him by four bikeborne assailants in Durgapuri, police were groping in the dark on Monday in the absence of any clue, including CCTV footage of the incident. The lone eyewitness, who was with the businessman at the time of the incident and was also looted, did tell the police that there were four miscreants but could not provide any further clue as he suffered injuries in the head after being hit by the looters.

The other miscreant snatched Bajaj’s bag which contained the cash and the two fled. Bhattacharya was referred to KGMU Trauma Centre where he was declared brought dead by doctors. “Locals have told us that the miscreants fled towards Mawaiya. There were no CCTV cameras around so we have no clue about their identity or the vehicles used. Bhattacharya’s family has ruled out personal enmity for motive,” said CO (Alambagh) Sanjeev Kumar Sinha. Mano (26), son of the deceased, said, “Bajaj visits Lucknow every Sunday to collect money from customers and stays in the hotel above our shop.

Ghaziabad,"Executive held hostage by cabbie for 3 hours, robbed of cash &amp; jewellery","GHAZIABAD: A 43-year-old executive of an auto component manufacturing company was allegedly robbed of Rs 1.15 lakh and a gold ring by a cab driver and three of his accomplices after he took the taxi from Ghaziabad railway station for his Greater Noida residence late on Sunday night. Manish Kumar Jha, the safety head of Spark Minda in Rewari, was allegedly held hostage at gunpoint for three hours and thrashed by his co-riders, forcing him to reveal his ATM card pin. Later the four withdrew Rs 1 lakh from his account. They also snatched his wallet containing Rs 15,000, mobile phone charger, earphone, and new clothes and some fruits he had bought, before dumping him near a school in Vijay Nagar in the early hours of Monday. Santosh Kumar Jha, his younger brother, told TOI that Manish was returning from Patna on Sunday. “Seemanchal Express was supposed to reach Ghaziabad around 9.30 pm but it was delayed by three hours. After getting down from the train, he took a cab from outside, but missed noticing a person sitting inside,” he said. “As soon as he boarded the cab, the driver stepped on the gas pedal. Within no time, the person sitting next to the driver pointed a gun at him. A little later, two other persons boarded the vehicle and made my brother sit in the middle. They had guns and knives and started beating my brother. He was forced to part with his debit cards and the passwords. They mainly hit him on his hands and knees,” Santosh added. The ordeal continued for over three hours. Around 3.30am, Manish was thrown out of the vehicle near Jindal Public School. In a badly bruised condition, he sought help from a passerby who told him to wait for the police patrolling vehicle. After covering a considerable distance on foot, Manish finally spotted a police patrolling bike and narrated the crime to cops. Based on his complaint, an FIR under IPC 392 (robbery) was lodged at Vijay Nagar police station. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said teams have been formed to investigate the case. “Noida police have also been informed as money was withdrawn from Noida ATMs as well,” he said. Similar crimes were reported in Ghaziabad in March this year too. A 30-year-old dentist was robbed by four persons in an auto-rickshaw, including the vehicle driver, while she was returning from her clinic in Vaishali. She was thrashed and kept inside the moving vehicle for around 45 minutes. They had gagged her mouth after blindfolding her and tying her hands and legs with ropes. "
Ghaziabad,Road institute has a plan to decongest 14 junctions,"GHAZIABAD: Poor design and lack of a proper enforcement mechanism are causing confusion and chaos, especially during the peak hours, at the city’s major traffic intersections, a report submitted by Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) to Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) said. The report studies 14 major intersections in the city, including GDA Old Bus Stand, Choudhary Mode, Indirapuram SRS Cinemas and Kanawani intersections. “Prior to implementation of Integrated Traffic Management System, we asked CRRI for a report to make necessary amendments to decongest roads,” said Kanchan Verma, vice chairperson, GDA. “The intersections are poorly designed, allowing on-street parking and stopping and standing at the corners. Wrong-lane driving and encroachments have worsened the problem,” said a CRRI official. “We had employed yardsticks like traffic, topographic and pedestrian surveys at each of the 14 intersections,” added the official. The GDA Old Bus Stand intersection, said the report, has excess open paved area at all corners which encourages private vehicles, vendors, autos and cycles to park to wait for passengers and for boarding and alighting of passengers in an unsafe manner. It often results in traffic congestion too. “We’ve proposed improving the intersection by providing traffic circulation plan for access to parking facilities under the flyover,” said the official. “Traffic control and safety measures in the form of road signs, marking, delineations and speed tables have also been proposed,” added the official. The report also highlighted the problem areas at the Choudhary mod intersection, which is located in the busy market area on GT Road. It said the presence of Chaudhary Cinema and a temple at the intersection was compounding the traffic woes. “We have proposed a separation at the junction and have also suggested strong traffic enforcement,” said the official. The report said a small rotary at Indirapuram SRS cinema intersection at the centre of Indirapuram on Kala Pather Road leading to Delhi-Meerut Expressway, is ineffective as traffic is flowing in all directions. The GDA’s new chief architect and town planner Asheesh Shivpuri said, “Before going about implementing the CRRI’s plan, we would like to discuss its proposals with a committee and only after that will we be in a position to say what can be implemented,” said Shivpuri.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Police boast 1,000km daily patrol, residents sceptical","LUCKNOW: If police are to be believed, they patrol 1,000km a day either in vans or on bikes. But, residents — particularly victims of snatching, burglary and street con — beg to differ. Gomtinagar resident Sandeep Agarwal, whose house was burgled of Rs 5.5 lakh worth of valuables on June 30, said he had hardly seen cops patrolling the area. In Indiranagar, Smita Pandey who was conned by men posing as cops said she didn’t remember the last time she had seen a UP 100 vehicle in her neighbourhood. Akash Deep, whose cafe on Nawal Kishore Road in Hazratganj was targeted on June 25 amid police’s debut ‘Jaagte Raho’ campaign, is planning to hire private security guards. “Burglars don’t fear police anymore. Moreover, patrolling is hardly done,” said. Rekha Shah, a resident of Rajajipuram, was robbed of her gold while she was learning how to ride a two-wheeler from her husband. The incident took place in front of Talkatora police outpost on June 8. Shah says no cops were present at the outpost while UP 100 patrol was conspicuous by its absence. The month of June alone saw 236 crimes, including murders and rapes. In other words, nearly eight crimes took place every day, the most vulnerable areas being Hazratganj, Vibhuti Khand, Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Mahanagar and Aliganj. Circle officer, Gomtinagar, Avnishwar Chandra Srivastava claimed they had “studied the pattern of crime” and accordingly, charted out a patrol plan. “You will see the difference this month,” he said. The UP 100 in-charge of Lucknow ASP Sarvesh Mishra said patrolling had increased, especially during night. Big police station areas have been given two four-wheelers and smaller thanas one. “The SHO concerned maps out the areas for patrolling by PRVs (police response vehicles). If he feels any specific area is witnessing more crimes, he can accordingly change the roster. On an average, 10km is covered by a vehicle. It increases when there is a spurt in crime in a certain area. On an average, the van fleet covers 730km daily. As many as 55 bikes cover another 275km area a day,” Mishra added. Officials at UP 100 said the whole of Lucknow district had 73 four-wheelers and 55 two-wheelers, mostly for patrolling in urban areas. They also said around 10,000 calls were received at UP 100 in June and all were attended to. "
Lucknow,"Write in capital letters, KGMU tells doctors","LUCKNOW: Doctors at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) will have to write prescriptions in capital letters from August 1. The university has taken the decision following complaints that its prescriptions are often illegible and patients find it difficult to procure medicines. There have also been instances when pharmacies have handed wrong medicines to patients because they too couldn’t decipher what was actually prescribed. “The circular has been issued to all the departments in accordance with the Medical Council of India guidelines,” said KGMU medical superintendent Dr BK Ojha. Patients in general welcomed the move. Some also recalled how wrong pills had done them or at least threatened to do them more harm than good. Bharti of Khadra, an ENT patient, said a pharmacy misread her prescription a week ago. “They gave me a pill to cure an ear infection, but it induced vomiting. Later, a doctor at a private hospital said the pharmacy had given me a wrong pill because they confused a spelling,” she said. Narendra Kumar (25) of Barabanki, who was escorting a cancer patient on Tuesday, told TOI that a medical store outside KGMU sent him back to the doctor twice for clarifications. Aliganj resident Shikha Pandey said recently, a doctor of general medicine had prescribed her a pill for blood pressure, but no pharmacist or chemist could read what it was. “I had to go back to KGMU and request the doctor to rewrite the prescription more clearly,” she added. Atul Singh, a resident of Balaganj who visited the urology OPD on Tuesday, said he had to hop from one private clinic to another to get some pathological tests done. “I simply wanted to avoid the rush at KGMU. But, no lab outside could read what tests were prescribed. So, here I am, waiting for my turn at KGMU.” A section of doctors also supported the decision. Dr Suryakant, head of respiratory medicine at KGMU, pointed out that there were many drugs with similar names. “Pharmacies are likely to confuse among these and give a wrong pill to a patient. The move can remedy the problem.” Dr Rakesh Kumar, head of paediatrics preventive dentistry, said: “Along with the brand name in capital letters, I think, the generic name should also be written. I have asked doctors in my department to follow this rule.” Another doctor had a sense of humour. “If we start practising (writing in capital letters) from now, it may become a habit in a month,” quipped Dr Shally Awasthi of the department of paediatrics.

Lucknow,UP to shrink cabinet berths to 27 for seamless working,"LUCKNOW: The much-awaited reorganization of government departments in UP kicked off on Tuesday when the state cabinet headed by CM Yogi Adityanath took up recommendations of the six-member committee set up by state government for merger of departments of similar nature. The reorganization is likely to reduce the number of existing 99 departments to almost half. The committee has sought the shrinking of the 86 cabinet berths to just 27. State government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh told reporters that cabinet reviewed the recommendations of committee that was set up on suggestions of Niti Aayog for better coordination and transparency in functioning. “Final decision was not taken but the cabinet was of view that state departments should correspond with those at Centre,” Singh added. “A final blue print for reorganization is being prepared and would be put up for cabinet approval soon. The Centre has formed new departments, like water conservation. Accordingly, the state government will have to set up a department for fast, smooth functioning in coordination with Centre,” he added. The committee, which was set up on January 3, 2018, and almost took a one-and-half year following marathon meetings, has also said that 17 departments of UP will remain untouched and not be merged. These 17 departments which will not be merged with any department are sugar industry and cane development, cooperative, public works department (PWD), transport, housing and urban development, prisons, election, food and civil supplies, health and famiy welfare, food safety and drug administration, secretariat, parliamentary affairs, Vidhan Parishad, chief minister's office and labour. The reports have made suggestions for bigger merges for key departments like finance, tourism and general administration. Tourism will be merged with languages and religious work of Uttar Pradesh. Finance will now be expanded to have two more departments -- Banking and institutional finance. Civil aviation will be merged with protocol (VIP duties on ministers’ movements) and estate department that deals with government assets. General administration will be merged with national integration, UP reintegration, Public service Management. Also, social welfare will expand into OBC welfare, divyang empowerment and servicemen welfare. A team of Niti Aayog officials had visited the state in May 2017 and recommended the amalgamation of similar departments, following which, a joint working group headed by Singh was constituted. “The Niti Aayog had given a road map and suggested actions needed for speedy development of UP. It included reorganization of departments for better functioning. The motto was minimum government and maximum governance,” he said. The reorganization would result in reduction of departments that could have political ramifications as the number of ministers will have to be reduced or portfolios distributed. For instance, while energy department is with Shrikant Sharma, the department of additional sources of energy is headed by Brijesh Pathak, who also holds the law portfolio. Significantly, Alok Kumar holds the dual charge of principal secretary, energy &amp; additional sources of energy. The cabinet also considered how departments being largely funded by Centre, would be merged. For instance, the rural engineering and rural electrification departments are being completely funded by Centre. “How would their funds be utilized and completion certificates issued will have to be decided. It is a long haul process,” said a senior official. "
Lucknow,"Defaulting on tax? Time to face the music, literally","LUCKNOW: How does one recover tax from brazen defaulters? ‘Band baja ke’ if it’s a civic body with a sense of humour. The Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) on Tuesday literally made an evasive hotelier dance to its tunes by unleashing a band of musicians on him outside his house on Sapru Marg. The five-member band drummed up a cackling crowd by announcing the defaulter’s name and pending property tax, and within 15 flat minutes, the hotel had coughed up Rs 33 lakh that it hadn’t paid in 1.5 years. Buoyed by the speedy recovery of tax, the civic authorities now plan the same treatment for other defaulters. The LMC has an annual tax target of Rs 350 crore from 5.48 lakh households and commercial establishments. But, it has been able to recover only Rs 178 crore in 2018 and Rs 170 crore in 2017. According to LMC officials, the hotelier who was named and shamed on Tuesday had been warned several times in the past, but he never paid heed. “So, we decided to adopt a policy originally put to practice by Pune Municipal Corporation,” said LMC zonal in-charge 1 Narendra Verma. As the band played and a loudspeaker boomed around 2.30pm, curious neighbours and amused passers-by started gathering near the hotelier’s home. The manager gave us a cheque of Rs 33 lakh, the pending tax. We will continue this strategy against other big defaulters,” Verma added. The message, it seems, has reached everyone loud and clear. Pankaj Shukla, an onlooker, said: “It was an entertaining sight for us, but embarrassing for the defaulter. I am going to clear all my dues ASAP.” "
Lucknow,"No deluge, but Lucknow already waterlogged","LUCKNOW: The first rainfall of monsoon exposed the laxity of Lucknow municipal corporation (LMC) as showers that lasted from 30 minutes to around two hours in various areas led to the same old problem — heavy waterlogging — proving that the civic body failed to get choked drains cleaned clean even thought the deadline was extended to June 30. An hour’s rainfall in Hazratganj led to ankle-deep waterlogging in the area. “The road in front of my house was waterlogged for two hours. I could not take out my vehicle and had to wade through to the market,” said Nitesh Verma, a resident. Similar complaints poured from Mahanagar. Jayant Mushran, a resident of Sector-B, said, “Just half an hour of showers caused waterlogging in front of my house.” As the drains overflowed at Parivartan Chowk, Daliganj, Lalbagh, Narhi and Kaiserbagh, pedestrians had to walk in the centre of the roads as the sides were inundated. “Dirty water was flowing on footpaths in Kaiserbagh, so we had to walk in the middle of the road,” said Tanuja Singh, a commuter. Waterlogged roads also resulted in jams from Hazratganj to Charbagh. “I am stuck in jam for last 45 minutes, it is the same story in every monsoon,” said Bhuvan Srivastava. A tree fell on Vidhan Sabha marg and slowed down traffic. “We called LMC, but no one picked, so we are removing the tree ourself,” said Rahul Dhawan. “We have already given orders to private agencies to clean all drains, which were not done properly. We have taken strict action against lax agencies by black-listing them,” said an LMC official. "
Lucknow,Lucknow airport revises parking fees to end queue chaos,"LUCKNOW: Parking a four-wheeler for less than 30 minutes at Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Amausi will now cost 50% less than earlier, but there’s a catch. A minute more will leave a motorist poor by Rs 85 if the vehicle is a hatchback or a sedan and by Rs 100 if it is an SUV. These fee slabs were introduced from Tuesday to ease traffic congestion on the airport premises and also warns of a penalty of Rs 150 if vehicles are found parked in unauthorised areas. While there will no longer be a provision for tokens for those who come to pick or drop passengers, a halt of more than three minutes in the terminal area will invite the usual parking fee. Earlier, parking at Amausi airport was managed by private agencies hired through tenders. Many avoided the designated parking lot to dodge the fee, which led to long queues of vehicles in front of the terminal gates. To avoid the chaos, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has revised parking fees and regulations. The charge of parking a four-wheeler, which was earlier Rs 60, will now be Rs 30 for 30 minutes. The same for a two-wheeler has been slashed to Rs 10 from Rs 20. However, an overstay for even a minute more will cost a car Rs 85, an SUV Rs 100 and a two-wheeler Rs 20. The rate will last for the next two hours after which the fee will increase by Rs 20/hour for four-wheelers and Rs 10/hour for two-wheelers Since complaints of haphazard parking were common, the AAI has also raised the penalty by five times of the minimum parking fee. In other words, any vehicle standing in a no-parking zone will have to cough up Rs 150 (four-wheeler) or Rs 50 (two-wheeler) for the first 30 minutes after which the vehicle will likely be towed away. Airport director AK Sharma said they were hiring staff to man the parking lots for two-wheelers, four-wheelers and other heavy vehicles at both the domestic and international terminals. “Also, a team will be deputed to keep vigil against unauthorised parking,” he added.

Others in the office reacted swiftly and overpowered Srivastava, who continued to threaten Sharma. “We then somehow managed to push him out of the room and locked the door. The guards standing outside caught him and later handed over to the police,” Sharma mentioned in the FIR. SP (West) Vikas Chandra Tripathi said that a licenced pistol and six bullets of .32 bore were recovered from the accused. “We are investigating the case and scanning CCTV footage and talking to the eye-witnesses about how he managed to take the gun inside. Srivastava has told us that he fired in the air and not at Sharma.” "
Lucknow,"Random boring stifles water table, Lucknow and suburbs face subsidence","LUCKNOW: The capital district is losing around 1,100 million litres of groundwater reserve every day owing to indiscriminate boring, which is also causing irreparable damage to the aquifer. Scientists have warned that if the problem is not tackled urgently, land subsidence was likely in parts of the city in eight to 10 years from now. An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel/sand/silt) from which groundwater can be extracted. According to a study conducted by hydrogeologist RS Sinha on groundwater status across urban centres in the Ganga basin, groundwater in the city and its suburbs is depleting at the rate of 1,100 million litres a day while recharge through rainwater covers only 5% of this total extraction. If the trend continues, water in the first acquifer out of three will be exhausted, leaving a vacuum below the surface and raising the threat of subsidence, warns the study that was recently presented at a Lucknow University conference. Sinha, also convener of Water Action Group, maintained that there were three distinguishable aquifer groups — each separated by 5-10 metres of clay — below Lucknow’s surface. The first is at a depth of 67-155 metres, the second between 155 metres and 327 metres and the third is found between 327 metres and 542 metres. The first aquifer, the expert reiterated, was under “tremendous threat”. Cracks in Kakori warning sign of land subsidenceThe study corroborates another research done by a group led by BB Trivedi, retired scientist of Central Ground Water Board (CGWB). In 2009, the team had warned that if groundwater depletion continued, several areas like Narhi, Charbagh, Rajajipuram and Gomtinagar would face land subsidence between 2024 and 2026. The study had been conducted after 250-metre-long cracks surfaced in Dullu Khera and Vader Khera, two villages in Kakori, in 2007. Lucknow University geology professor Dhruvsen Singh, who probed the Kakori subsidence and has been working on rivers and lakes in the Ganga plains, said groundwater was accumulated in porous and permeable sediment and rocks. An impervious layer of clay acts like a seal. “When water is indiscriminately extracted, it leaves behind vacuum in sediment and rocks. The clay becomes dry and develops cracks. Simultaneously, the vacuum increases the compactness of sediment and clay. They contract when pressure is generated on the surface due to heavy rainfall or movement of heavy objects, leading to land subsidence,” he explained. Singh offered an analogy to elaborate further. “Think of a rasgulla filled with sugar syrup. If you squeeze it too hard, it never regains its original shape. Loss of syrup makes it collapse. The same happens when groundwater is badly exploited without recharging aquifers,” he said. "

Lucknow,"Key documents gutted in PICUP blaze, CM Yogi Adityanath orders probe","LUCKNOW: Many important files, computers and furniture were gutted in a major fire that broke out in the finance department of Pradeshiya Industrial &amp; Investment Corporation of Uttar Pradesh Limited (PICUP) Bhawan in Vibhuti Khand of Gomtinagar on Wednesday evening. The fire broke out on the second floor of the building. Nine fire tenders struggled for over two hours to douse the flames. The fire was reportedly caused by a short-circuit in a computer. Since key files were gutted in the fire, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered a probe to determine the cause of the incident and damages, besides fixing the responsibility. A 3-member committee comprising ADG Lucknow zone, special secretary industry and additional MD UPSIDA PK Pandey and chief fire officer will probe all the aspects and submit its report in two days. According to police, the fire broke out at 7.15pm. Two employees and a guard present on the second floor intially tried to douse the fire and then informed the police and the fire department. By the time fire tenders arrived the flames had spread to the third floor. Chief fire officer VK Singh said, ""Except the finance department, all other offices in the building had shut for the day when the fire broke out. We are trying to verify the claims of the employees that fire was caused by a short-circuit. Though fire safety systems were installed in the building, it needs to be probed whether they were functional."" Manoj Gupta, deputy manager in the finance department, was present in the building at the time of the incident. He told TOI: ""I saw smoke coming out of the chamber of the manager's personal staff at 7.15 pm. Before I could alert the guard, flames started leaping out of the chamber.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Defunct CCTV cameras give crooks a free run,"LUCKNOW: An unidentified man looted Rs 1.25 crore from a cash van in Gole Market in 2016, but police are clueless till date because the surveillance camera near the scene of crime was defunct. Killer of businessman Manoj Bhattacharya are still roaming scot-free because the spot near Durgapuri Metro station where he was shot has no CCTV cameras. While most capital cities in India have foolproof electronic surveillance to curb crime, lack of planning and co-ordination between civic authorities and police has left Lucknow vulnerable. The city has over 220 big and small traffic intersections, but only 70 are technically covered by CCTV cameras. Of the 280 cameras installed at these crossings, 44 at 10 major intersections are missing. The ""blind zones"" include Durgapuri, Charbagh, Station Road, IT College, Badshah Nagar, Bhootnath Market, HAL crossing, Sector-25 Indiranagar and Telibagh. ""The cameras at 70 crossings were installed under the modern control room project of Lucknow police between 2015 and 2016. It was supposed to cover the entire city, but the plan changed in 2017 when the responsibility of city surveillance was passed on to Lucknow Municipal Corporation under the Smart City project. The latter is underway,"" said Sarvesh Mishra, ASP, police control room. Regarding the missing cameras at 10 crossings, Mishra said: ""They were removed during construction work by civic agencies, but were not put back together after completion of work."" SK Jain, project manager for Smart City, added that they would cover 110 crossings in the city with CCTV cameras and the process was underway. Residents remained sceptical with cases of con, burglary, snatching and shooting being the order of the day. Gomtinagar, the soft target of break-in gangs, is not covered by surveillance cameras, they pointed out. Anil Kumar, who lives at Rapti Apartments in Gomtinagar extension, said not just his residential complex, many others in the area had witnessed a spate of burglaries. ""Had CCTV cameras been installed here, police could have at least identified some of the gangs,"" said Kumar whose flat was targeted on June 15. "
Lucknow,Charbagh shooting has Bihar underbelly,"LUCKNOW: In a shocking twist to the Charbagh shooting case, police found on Wednesday that the victim, Virendra Thakur (45) was not a property dealer and transporter as he had claimed, but a gangster from Bettiah district of Bihar and was facing several criminal cases, including murder. Thakur had shifted base to Lucknow in 2013 following threat to his life from rival gangs and was living in Nilmatha, Cantonment under an assumed name. Police officials suspect that the attempt on his life was a result of his old gang rivalry or revenge executed in a planned manner through ‘honey trap’. Thakur had suffered two bullet injuries when he was shot at by two unidentified bike-borne miscreants in a sensational daylight shooting on the crowded main road in Charbagh on Tuesday. He had told police that an acquaintance had called him for meeting. Police investigation, however, revealed that his real name was Gorakh Thakur and that 17 criminal cases are registered against him in Bettiah and West Champaran districts of Bihar. SP Government Railway Police, Lucknow division, Saumitra Yadav said, “During questioning, Thakur’s wife Priyanka Singh told us that they hail from Bettiah district in Bihar. When we called Bettiah police, the officials there revealed his criminal history to us and also that his real name was Gorakh, not Virendra. The criminal cases against him are of murder, attempt to murder, arms act, narcotics, extortion and liquor smuggling among others.” “Thakur was running a gang in Bihar, but when gang rivalries escalated and the threat to his life increased, he shifted to Lucknow with his wife and three sons and started living in Nilmatha where his sister lived with her husband, a subedar in army. He changed his first name and projected himself as a property dealer and businessman, but still continued his extortion and smuggling business in the two Bihar districts with the help of his gang. He had been arrested by Bihar Police in various cases and had been to jail several times and was out on bail,” added Yadav. Thakur had sustained bullet injuries on his back and right thigh. He is currently under treatment at KGMU Trauma Centre and his condition is said to be stable. "

Lucknow,One in every 10 pregnant teens is from Uttar Pradesh: Survey,"LUCKNOW: Every tenth teenage pregnancy reported in India is of a girl from Uttar Pradesh and the maximum number of these cases are happening in Bahraich district of the state. Experts at a conference in the city on Wednesday extrapolated data from the National Family Health Survey (NHFS-4) and 2011 Census to claim that India is estimated to have around 44.67 lakh teenage pregnancies every year. Of this, over 4 lakh cases are from UP alone, they said. Jointly organised by Society for Advancement of Village Economy (SAVE) and World Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (WASME), the conference said 20 districts accounted for 49% of the state’s total teenage pregnancies. “The burden on UP is huge, which calls for a public movement. We need to go door to door and include education department/private schools to spread awareness against teenage pregnancy, which sometimes is a result of child marriage. It is illegal, but still happens in the name of customs and religion. It leads to complications for both the young mother and the child,” state health minister Sidharth Nath Singh said at the conference. Executive director, Population Foundation of India, Poonam Muttreja said child marriage in UP stood at 21%, as per NFHS data. Of this, 4% end up with teenage pregnancies. In fact, 23% of girls in UP in the age group of 15-19 years end up with a child because they do not have access to contraception,” she added. Secretary of SAVE Sampa Banerjee pointed out that early marriage and consequent teenage pregnancy posed a high risk to the demographic divide of UP. “Awareness campaigns and easy access to reproductive health education and services have the potential to save adolescent girls, which will in turn save economic burden,” she observed.

The missing files came to light when records of the two housing schemes were being scanned for the online property-tagging software that has recently been introduced by the GDA. “Ever since we introduced online property tagging software in the GDA, we have been working on uploading all files related to property, which so far was manually preserved,” said Verma. “The process involves scanning all property files and getting it uploaded in the system. But during the course of scanning, it was found that many files of the Madhuban Bapudham scheme were either found to be missing or duplicate files were placed in the record books,” added Verma. “This raises suspicion as there are chances it could have been deliberate to benefit some buyers, so an inquiry under GDA’s additional secretary has been ordered.” Under the Madhuban Bapudham housing scheme alone, there are over 5,000 property files which are stacked in GDA’s strong room. “In a digital world, the very aim to bring all of GDA’s over 1.5 lakh properties, which are interspersed across 27 of its housing schemes, online is to enable access to property-related details like size, location, building plan and dues at the click of button,” Verma said. The GDA has, on a pilot basis, taken up the Madhuban Bapudham scheme first. The online tagging will cover all its properties. "
Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh government retires 200 tainted officials, more on radar","LUCKNOW: The state government has compulsorily retired more than 200 officials across 72 government departments and is contemplating harsh punishment against 400 others in pursuance of its zero tolerance policy towards corruption and non-performance. At least 51 employees of state home department and 36 of revenue department have been forcibly retired. Similarly, eight officials of basic education, seven of dairy and six of cane development departments have met the same fate. Besides, five employees each of urban development and excise departments and three of khadi and village development board were also handed over retirement letters, said officials. Also, non-performing and tainted employees above 50 years of age are on the radar. This comes two weeks after the CM took a similar step to forcefully retire corrupt and lax police officers who were above the age of 50, as per an order made public by then UP Police ADG (establishment) Piyush Anand. Plan to stop promotion of tainted employeesAll state departments have been asked to prepare a list of officials facing corruption. They too would be sent packing,” said state government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma. The government is also contemplating to stop promotion of tainted employees, who are less than 50 years of age. “Inquiry against them would also be expedited,” he said. Sources said around 170 employees of energy department are likely to face the music and their promotions would be stalled. Likewise, 26 officials of basic education and 25 of panchayati raj departments are in the cross-hairs. According to an estimate, the Yogi Adityanath government has initiated inquiry against 400 employees. “No one involved in corruption will be spared,” Sharma said. Under fundamental rule 56 of state government, the competent authority at any time can serve a three-month notice to an official above 55 years of age and send him on compulsory retirement. The fresh order by government has hit the power department most, with 169 of its employees being bracketed as fit to receive punishment for graft or “adverse” job entry in the department. None of them though would be voluntarily retiring “They are free to move court. The move came after brainstorming and discussions with top IAS, legislators and members of various agencies,” said government official. Non-performing employees came under the radar soon after state government’s decision to get rid of officials who were given extension after retirement by the Akhilesh Yadav government. "

Lucknow,Got a plaint against errant officials? Dial UP CM helpline,"LUCKNOW: Continuing his government’s recent anti-graft policies, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday launched a 24-hour toll free helpline for people to register complaints and air grievances against errant government officers from anywhere in the state. The CM helpline 1076 will be dealt by staff of Yogi’s office. This came a day after the government said that it had voluntarily retired 201 inefficient officials — either due to corruption taint or having crossed 50 years of age — from 72 departments, while also announced to mete out harsh punishment to 417 officials from the departments including home, revenue, finance and power. Yogi said the helpline was an addition to the existing Integrated Grievance Redressal System (IGRS) known as Jansunwai portal, that deals with complaints on website. “The new system was on a testing mode for the past one year. I was delighted to see the response of people from far away corners sharing their complaints and redressal through IGRS. Now we have introduced 1076 helpline for round-the-clock monitoring of complaints and providing them personal contact,” CM told a gathering at Lok Bhawan here. Yogi said the helpline would also work as a self-monitoring mechanism on governments officers’ availability, attendance and their work performance. “I will attach the ACRs (annual confidential reports) of officers and their attendance based on this helpline. It will be a 360 degrees mechanism. That will monitor the government performance as well,” he said “After registration of a complaint, its follow-up will be done within 3-4 days to make sure that it is redressed,” the CM said. He, however, warned of action against those sending fake complaints and raising false alarms against honest officers. Yogi shared that the helpline has generated direct employment for 500 officials, who would work in the call centre. He also warned of action against the officials of the department concerned in case the complaints are not addressed. "
Lucknow,Excise department churning to break mafia nexus,"LUCKNOW: The state excise department has decided to transfer lower-rung officials who have been holding on to their posts for a long time. Sources said this was done to break the nexus between unscrupulous excise department officials and the liquor mafia. This comes a day after the department announced that NSA will be slapped on those supplying adulterated liquor in the state. In the recent hooch tragedy that claimed the lives of about a dozen people in Barabanki last month, six officials — including an inspector rank officer of the excise department — were placed under suspension for their alleged involvement in the sale of spurious liquor. Allegations of manipulation in postings and extended stay by officers in one position had come to light during a review meeting by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. There are nearly 1,300 district-level excise officers rung in the state and many, according to sources, have managed to stay in one position for a long period. Principal secretary (excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy told TOI that a warning was issued on Thursday to lower-rung officers to abstain from seeking stay on new postings under the premise of family compulsions. This would be deemed “misconduct” and “disciplinary action may follow,” he added. The new transfer and posting policy of the state government holds that no official can stay in a district beyond three years and in a division beyond seven years, said Bhoosreddy. “But a number of officials have been under the scanner for staying on in one district for five to 10 years. These officers have been identified and action will be taken against them,” said Bhoosreddy. "
Lucknow,"Haj quota up, but applications dip","LUCKNOW: There has been a steep decline in the number of haj applications from Uttar Pradesh this year despite 20% increase in the state’s quota. The applications are down by 20%, shows the data of State Haj Committee. In 2018, as many as 43,100 pilgrims had applied for 29,053 haj seats from UP. Of them, 31,679 pilgrims had finally boarded the flights to Mecca after clearance of waiting lists and adjustments of seats from other states. This year, UP has 32,237 seats after the Central Haj Committee added 20% seats to the state’s kitty. But so far, State Haj Committee has received just 34,384 applications — a 20% drop as compared to applications received last year. However, given the low number of applications, all applicants have been selected for the pilgrimage. Taking last minute cancellations into consideration, it is expected that 32,100 pilgrims from UP will board the haj flights to Saudi Arabia this year. State Haj Committee authorities said this was the first occasion when applications have dipped. Though they did not cite any reason for the drop, sources attribute it to scrapping of haj subsidy by the central government. “There is a drop in the number of applications but we are yet to analyse the reasons,” said secretary, State Haj Committee, Rahul Gupta. The first batch of haj pilgrims flew out of Delhi on Wednesday. Haj pilgrims will leave from Lucknow embarkation point on July 21 and from Varanasi on July 29. "

The decision to ban these vans was taken because their haphazard parking in public places and on busy roads led to frequent traffic bottlenecks. However, the directive was never implemented in letter and spirit. As a result, while there was no respite from congestion of arteries, the LMC also suffered financial losses to the tune of Rs 90 lakh in terms of licence fee. Now, the civic body has asked the in-charge of all eight city zones to identify ideal spots where food vans can operate without disrupting traffic. If the proposal gets a nod at the house meeting, all food trucks will be licensed and zonal officials will then carry out their registration, besides allotting them specific spots. The LMC, in association with the Food and Drug Administration, will also periodically check the quality of food being served from these vans. If the quality is found to be bad, the registration will immediately be cancelled. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said, “We are in process of framing laws for food vans and the proposal will be tabled in front of the house. A policy will be framed to regularise food vans (if the proposal is cleared).” "
Lucknow,Defaulter thrashes LMC’s band-baja tax recovery team,"LUCKNOW: The face-the-music campaign of LMC to recover pending property tax boomeranged on Thursday when a rogue defaulter in Sarojininagar roughed up an official and his driver on being denied more time to cough up dues. While an FIR has been lodged at Sarojininagar thana, LMC staff have threatened to boycott work from Friday if police failed to take appropriate action against the accused. The LMC band-baja recovery team, led by tax superintendent Dhirendra Singh and in-charge of Zone 5 Sanjay Bharti, went to collect Rs 70 lakh from the owner of a commercial complex in Gauri Market. As the band drummed up the name-shaming drive, the owner came out of the building and tried to negotiate with LMC officials. The FIR says he sought more time. When the team refused the same, he mobilised neighbouring shopkeepers and allegedly started beating up tax superintendent Singh and his driver Gangaram. When Singh tried to call police, the accused allegedly snatched his phone and broke it. The unexpected belligerence prompted the LMC team to beat a hasty retreat. The injured were taken to hospital and discharged after first aid. Sarojininagar SHO Pramod Kumar Singh said the accused trader had been charged with assault and using force to deter a public servant from discharging duty. “The LMC officials were sent for medical examination. Necessary action will be taken against the accused,” the officer added. "

Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh government to move HC against Mukhtar Ansari's acquittal,"LUCKNOW: The state government on Thursday evening said that it would file an appeal in the high court against the Delhi's CBI special court order acquitting mafia and BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari, his brother and BSP MP Afzaal Ansari and other accused in the murder of BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai. Rai, an MLA from Mohammadabad seat in Ghazipur, was shot dead in 2005 along with six aides. A state government spokesperson said the CM has taken cognizance of the verdict. The government will examine the judgement and file appeal in the high court, he added. The accused were acquitted due to lack of evidence. Special Judge Arun Bhardwaj, who considered various aspects of the case, including whether there was an enmity between Ansaris and Rai, held that when a contestant loses Assembly elections, ""it will not result in enmity of such nature and enormity that he will think of murdering his opponent who defeated him"". Rai's wife Alka Rai, who had pleaded for a CBI probe, had also hinted at moving the high court. Alka is MLA from Mohammadabad assembly seat in Ghazipur. Besides Ansari brothers, others acquitted in the case are Sanjeev Maheshwari, Eijazul Haq (brother-in-law of Ansaris), Rakesh Pandey, Ramu Mallah, Mansoor Ansari and Munna Bajrangi. Bajrangi, a dreaded criminal in UP, was killed inside Baghpat jail last year. "
Lucknow,Debts tribunal summons MLA son of Gorakhpur 'bahubali',"LUCKNOW: Debt recovery tribunal (DRT) in Delhi has summoned BSP MLA Vinay Shankar Tiwari on a complaint by a consortium of banks, citing non-performing assets (NPAs) alleging fraud by Tiwari's firm Gangotri Enterprises Ltd to the tune of Rs 1,129 crore. The Chillupar MLA is the son of veteran Gorakhpur strongman Hari Shankar Tiwari. A consortium of banks led by Bank of India and including Canara Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Corporation Bank, IDBI, Axis Bank and Central Bank of India had approached DRT for the recovery of loans. Contacted by TOI on phone, Vinay Shankar refused comment on the summons or the bank loan recovery process.

""For the satisfaction of this court, the DRT feels that it is not appropriate to send this notice to you in a normal way, hence by way of this advertisement notice, we are informing that you have to be present on July 6, 2019, at 10.30 am,"" the DRT notice, published in the state's vernacular dailies, said. The banks have told DRT that the borrowing company Gangotri and its officials, with dishonest intention of causing wrongful loss and ""wrongful gains to themselves"" have fraudulently committed acts of misappropriation, criminal breach of trust by diverting bank's funds for purposes other than what loans were granted for. The banks also told DRT the declaration of fraud was reported to RBI and Central Repository of Information on Large Credits. The banks have also approached RBI to request a 'look out circular' (LOC) against company's director, guarantors and promoters, saying it is necessary ""to prevent any possibility of economic offender leaving the country."" Gangotri was formed in 1991. Vinay and Reeta are the second-largest shareholders in Gangotri. "
Lucknow,"Yogi government retires 200 tainted officials, 400 more on radar","LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath government in UP on Wednesday said that in pursuance of its 'zero tolerance' policy against corruption, it has given compulsory retirement to over 200 tainted officials and employees in the past two years while more than 400 others are under the scanner for 'exemplary punishment'. The move has been initiated on the basis of a report of a screening committee formed in July 2017, soon after the BJP government came to power and Yogi ordered to identify officials and employees who have crossed 50 years of age and are involved in graft cases. ""The government has given forced retirement to 201 state employees. Many more are on the radar,"" UP minister and government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said, adding that 417 others are being watched and could get 'exemplary punishment'. Sharma said all departments have been asked to prepare a list of officials facing corruption charges. ""They too would be sent packing,"" he added. Among those who have been given forced retirement, 51 are from the home department, 36 from revenue, eight from basic education, seven from dairy development and six from cane development. Besides, five employees each of urban development and excise departments and three of Khadi and village development board were also handed over retirement letters, said officials sources. The government is also contemplating to stop promotion of tainted employees who are less than 50 years of age. ""At the same time, inquiry against them would be expedited,"" Sharma said. Among those on the list for 'exemplary punishment', 170 employees are from energy department, 26 from basic education and 25 from panchayati raj. While the list of corrupt officials was ready, the action was fast-tracked when, around 10 days ago, Yogi started taking review meetings in Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Saharanpur and Moradabad about progress on various central and state government schemes. During these review meetings, he directed various district administrations to take quick action against officers identified as 'corrupt'. A senior official told TOI that service records of employees and officials, mainly those who are 50 years or above, are being checked for making the list. ""The officers and employees are being screened not only as per their service entries but also their reputation in department,"" said a senior IAS officer. "

Senior registrar of Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC withdrew the July 1 notice about the farewell, known as full court reference in legal parlance.

In a fresh order, senior registrar Manvendra Singh said, “Due to unforeseen circumstances, the July 1 notice on full court reference (farewell) is withdrawn.” "
Ghaziabad,Narrow escape for 6 families as flats in Vaishali catch fire,"GHAZIABAD: Six families, including those of a Prasar Bharati private secretary and a chartered accountant, had a narrow escape early on Thursday after their flats in Vaishali were engulfed in a fire caused by a short-circuit in a transformer nearby. Residents said they had seen sparks coming out of the transformer on Wednesday evening too, but the electricity department officials who had come there did not take their complaint too seriously. They allegedly doused the sparks with sand and left. The six flats that were damaged are built on two back-to-back plots (263 and 293), while the 630 KVA transformer is installed within metres of the two buildings. P Chandrashekhar (53), a private secretary in Prasar Bharati, said he and his wife were sleeping in their first-floor flat (B1 263) when they heard a loud noise around 12.45am and saw flames leaping towards their house. “Had there been a little delay in coming out of the house, we would not have survived. The blaze was quite intense and had spread to the drawing room in no time. Fortunately, it was only my wife and I who were in the house. My daughter is on a trip to Singapore to attend an academic seminar. We somehow managed to come out of the flat and run downstairs,” Chandrashekhar told TOI. Vijay Prakash Singh, a chartered accountant who lives on the second floor of the same building with his wife and two young sons, accused the fire department of responding late. “Initially, they sent a fire tender having a capacity of just 200-300 litres of water. It was insufficient to douse the flames. Maximum damage had already been done by the time bigger ones came to our rescue,” he added. It was the first-floor flat of Rajiv Shahi, who works with a finance company, on the second plot that bore the maximum brunt. Almost all household items inside his flat were burnt to ashes. The other flats that were damaged in the fire are owned a GST inspector, and a manager with an automobile company. Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) sub-divisional officer Shashank Shukla said the blaze could have started because of dry leaves on the roof of the building, where the transformer is installed. “I will prepare a report and submit it to the electricity department. We are with the victims and would try to provide them monetary relief as well,” he added. On the issue of delayed response, chief fire officer Sunil Kumar Singh said fire tenders were busy attending to two other incidents. “Earlier, we were informed about the fire in the transformer only. Other fire tenders were immediately rushed to the spot after we came to know the exact magnitude of the blaze,” he added. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad civic body plans two pipes for kitchen, sewer water","GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) is working on a plan to ensure judicious use of kitchen and sewer water in the city. It is in the process of formulating guidelines for housing societies which will be later incorporated in its building bylaws. “Waste water has been categorised into two heads — grey and black water. While grey refers to kitchen waste water, black refers to waste water from toilets,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner, GDA. “We have proposed that all future group housing societies lay two separate pipelines connected to each household through which kitchen (grey water) and sewer (black water) will be channelised,” he said. “Kitchen water, which does not require much treatment, will be stored in an underground reservoir especially built for the purpose. Residents can easily use it for watering lawns and washing their cars,” added Shivpuri. “Toilet or sewer water will be channelised into the nearest STP (sewage treatment plant) through a network of pipelines. After treatment, it will be used for watering the city’s parks and at construction sites,” he said. The GDA hopes to limit groundwater extraction which has wreaked havoc with the city’s table. As per the UP groundwater department, the average depletion in Ghaziabad in the last five years, from 2013 to 2018, has been recorded at 4.35 metres. There are at least 12 spots out of total 38 measured in the city table that have gone dry in this period. "

Lucknow,ED attaches Rs 89 lakh assets of ex-Noida chief engineer,"LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday attached assets worth Rs 89 lakh of the former chief engineer of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority Yadav Singh in a money laundering case, taking the total attachment in the case to more than Rs 21 crore. The former chief engineer is being investigated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) for illegally allotting work to contractors which resulted in undue advantage of Rs 19.92 crore to NKG Infrastructure Ltd, JSP Constructions Pvt Ltd and Tirupati Construction Company. Singh was suspended in 2015. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered an FIR against him in July 2015. The agency later filed a chargesheet against Singh and his family members, revealing accumulation of disproportionate assets to the tune of about Rs 24 crore — 513% more than his known source of income — on the basis of which the ED had started the probe. In another case filed by the agency, the probe found Singh’s wife, Kusum Lata, had acquired disproportionate assets from the proceeds Singh received by awarding illegal contracts. “Investigation found that Kusum Lata along with her sister-in-law Vidhya Devi formed a trust named PGP Trust to project proceeds of crime as untainted money. Donations by cheque were deposited in the account of PGP Trust and equivalent amount in cash was returned in lieu of donations received,” the ED had claimed in a chargesheet. The agency had earlier attached properties of PGP Charitable Trust of Singh in which his wife was one of the trustees. The assets attached on Friday include residential and commercial properties, besides agricultural land and bank accounts. Explaining the modus operandi, ED officials said that during investigation it was revealed that funds related to income from illegal earning/unexplained sources were routed to the trust under control of Singh in the guise of corpus donations. The same fund was routed to the bank accounts of his family members in guise of sale proceeds of properties and the same was used for purchasing further commercial/residential properties at Delhi and Noida and maintaining bank balances to the tune of Rs 89 lakh.

Ghaziabad,"Jobless and suspicious of wife, man wipes out family before killing self","GHAZIABAD: A 37-year-old man allegedly killed his wife with a hammer and poisoned his three kids to death before committing suicide in Masuri early on Friday. The alleged murders come barely six days after a former official of a pharmaceutical company reportedly killed his wife and two children and hanged himself from the ceiling fan of their house in Gurgaon. Officers in Ghaziabad police said Pradeep had been unemployed for the past one and a half years and had turned alcoholic over time. His wife Sangeeta (32) worked as a nurse at AIIMS’s National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre here, and the couple had three daughters — Mansavi (8), Yashasvi (5) and Ojasvi (3). They lived with Pradeep’s father Feru Valmiki, who retired as a master chief petty officer in the Indian Navy, mother Sheela and sister Reena in a single-storey house in New Shatabadipuram. Police have recovered a six-page suicide note purportedly written by Pradeep, suspecting his wife of being involved in an illicit relationship. The letter also vividly mentions the way the woman and the three girls were murdered. Quoting the “suicide note”, SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh said Pradeep first hit his wife on the head multiple times with a hammer and then forced the three daughters to drink poison. He wrapped their mouths and heads with a four-inch-wide black tape to ensure they did not blurt out the poison. Pradeep, too, wrapped his head with the same tape and drank poison. Police said when they entered the room, the bodies of Pradeep and his three daughters were found on the bed while Sangeeta lay on the floor. She was being rushed to a nearby government hospital as she was found breathing feebly, but died on the way. Ironically, the black adhesive tape used by Pradeep to wrap the faces of his wife and daughters was actually brought home by Sangeeta. It is used for containing violent patients undergoing treatment at hospitals. It was Pradeep’s sister Reena who first spotted the bodies. Reena told police she woke up around 4.30am and saw Pradeep lying on the sofa. Asked why he was not in the bedroom, Pradeep went inside but did not say anything. A little later, Reena heard cries of the three children and knocked on the door, but Pradeep asked her to go back saying he was just talking to them. Finding something amiss, Reena woke up her elderly parents and alerted neighbours. When she peeped inside the bedroom through a glass above the door, she saw the bodies lying on the bed. The police control room was informed around 5.40am. SSP Singh reached the house along with a team of senior officials. The bodies were sent for autopsy. Relatives said Pradeep would often accuse his wife of having an affair and had claimed that his daughters had been conceived through IVF. He was jobless for around a year and a half and would often come home drunk, which led to frequent quarrels with his wife. On Thursday too, Pradeep and Sangeeta had fought over delay in paying the electricity bill. A commerce graduate, Pradeep had taken admission in a foundation course offered by the Institute of Cost Accountants of India, but left it in the middle. A relative said Pradeep had told him he had landed a job in a private company and would join work in a few days. According to the man’s cousin, Ravindra Kumar, Pradeep and Sangeeta had met 12 years ago while working at a private hospital in Patparganj and fell in love. Pradeep worked there as a storekeeper while Sangeeta was a nurse. Sangeeta was originally from Ranchi, while Pradeep’s hometown was in Meerut’s Aghera village. “Pradeep doted on his three daughters and it was quite shocking to see the way he killed them. We had spoken on Thursday evening and he told me he would like to see me on Friday,” Ravindra said. On a complaint by Pradeep’s father Feru Valmiki, an FIR against his son was registered under IPC sections 302 (murder), 306 (abetment of suicide) and 307 (attempt to murder) at Masuri police station.

The membership drive is being billed as a big event by the party ahead of bypolls on 12 UP assembly seats. BJP is seeing the event to build upon the momentum gathered after Lok Sabha results for 2022 UP polls, which many feel could be a direct fight between BJP and BSP, which increased its Lok Sabha tally from zero to 10. BSP supremo Mayawati has snapped ties with the Samajwadi Party and announced to contest bypolls and future polls independently. BJP will launch a missed call service to enroll new members. On Friday, Nadda, BJP national secretary (organisation) Shiv Prasad, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP UP in-charge Sunil Bansal, Union minister and state BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey and deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma went into a closed-door meeting with district general secretaries.

The party also delegated membership drive work for July 6 to all ministers. Senior state leaders Vidyasagar Sonkar, Ashok Kataria, Salil Bishnoi, Vijay Bahadur Pathak were present in the meeting, but the presence of former Union minister Kalraj Mishra led to speculation if he would be appointed as UP BJP president or a governor. Mishra, though said that such decisions are taken by the organisation. “I am happy to be part of the meeting today. I was invited by senior leaders. I met Sunil Bansal. Decision on my role would be decided by the organisation only,” he told TOI. UP minister Swatantra Dev is also a front-runner for state BJP president’s post. "
Kanpur,"Uttar Pradesh: Sepoy mutiny guns, utensils found in well","KANPUR: Decades-old weapons, including six guns, two bronze utensils, a pot and a pitcher, were discovered from a village well in Banda district. Cleaning of village well under ‘Talab-Kuan Jiyao Abhiyan’ was underway in Mahokhar village under Dehat Kotwali police station for the past few days when the rare items were recovered. The villagers tried to connect the rusted guns and bronze utensils to the 1857 mutiny when Indians had revolted against the rule of the British East India Company. “It seems that a warrior class used to live in this region in the past, said a villager. “About five days ago, while cleaning a well under the project ‘Talab-Kuan Jiyao Abhiyan’, a labourer Devnath, came across a rusted gun. Next day, he again found five rusted guns besides few tools and a bronze pot and a pitcher. He and the fellow labourers immediately informed the village head Ram Sajeevan Verma, who in turn alerted the district and police authorities following which a police team of Dehat Kotwali police station took all the discovered ancient firearms and utensils in its possession”, said Circle Officer Rajiv Pratap Singh. But, one cannot rely on mere speculations, and these iron weapons and utensils need to get authenticated by historians and archaeologists, he added. Head of Makohar village Ram Sajeevan Verma said, “I tried to gather information about the connection of our village to the 1857 mutiny, but have failed to get any clue.

Kanpur,Headmaster assaulted in Sachendi area,"KANPUR: A man allegedly assaulted headmaster of a Government Basic Primary School in Sachendi area after he resisted the former’s attempt to molest fellow female teachers. Following a complaint made by school headmaster Rauf, police have launched an investigation in this regard. The incident took place on Thursday at Raikepur village under Sachendi police station when a villager Manoj Yadav, after being scolded by school headmaster Rauf, allegedly barged into the school and assaulted him with a belt. “As Manoj used to stalk women teachers, the headmaster warned him to mend ways.

Lucknow,Funds from petrol and diesel cess to make UP zoom on highways,"LUCKNOW: The increase of Re 1 in additional excise duty and road cess each on petrol and diesel per litre have raised the hopes of the state government for getting more funds for the construction and strengthening of roads. UP has one of the longest road networks in the country. Officials in the public works department (PWD) said that the increase in fuel cess was certainly going to benefit the state road network, essentially in villages to boost rural economy of the state. ""The increase in cess on fuel would contribute to the funds dedicated for road infrastructure and would benefit all states including UP,"" said principal secretary PWD Nitin Ramesh Gokaran. Officials said that an increase in funds could be utilized for strengthening roads connecting villages with district headquarters. According to PWD records, UP has more than 2.4 lakh km of roads. Of these, around 8,500 km is that of national highways, around 7,000 km of state highways, nearly 7,300 km of main district roads, around 50,000 km of other district roads and over 1.6 lakh km of rural roads. Except for national highways, maintenance of all other kinds of roads is done by the state government. Officials said that the funds pooled in from petrol and diesel costs would be utilized for maintenance of all kinds of roads. The funds might also be utilised for making roads pothole-free, officials said. In 2018-19, the state government had identified over 44,000 km of roads to be made pothole-free, PWD records show. For the financial year 2019-20, the state government would be carrying out road work for around 65,000 km at a cost of around Rs 3,500 crore. This includes 42,000 km of special repair work at a cost of Rs 294 crore, 16,500 km of newly constructed roads at a cost of Rs 2,186 crore and special maintenance of 6,500 km of road at a cost of over Rs 1,000 crore.

Kanpur,"UP asked for AIIMS in west, IIT in Bundelkhand, got nothing","An AIIMS in western UP, an IIT in Bundelkhand and an IIM in east UP, Rs 2,300 crore for Namami Gange project and more funds for the defence corridor and many more items had figured in the state’s wish list presented ahead of the Union Budget. But, the first Budget of NDA-II has not included any of these. Uttar Pradesh finance minister Rajesh Agarwal, while attending an all-India meeting of finance ministers in Delhi chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, had placed the state’s wish list. The state was especially looking forward to the Budget following the Niti Aayog’s report that showed UP slipping in its health services in the last three years and made recommendations for speedy improvement in this sector. Probably with this at the back of its mind, the state had demanded at least one more AIIMS. However, there has been no mention of it in the budget. Demand for another IIT in Bundelkhand by the UP government came on the back of the concern to develop this industrially backward region facing repeated drought in the past few years, lacking basic amenities like electricity and water. Also, while the Yogi government has been working overtime to prepare DPRs for Metros in Kanpur, Meerut and Agra, the Budget has not made any allocation to give them a push. As for the proposed defence corridor in Bundelkhand, Sitharaman had taken keen interest as Union defence minister but her Budget did not mention it. In his speech during the pre-Budget session, Agarwal had emphasised that since UP has maximum population and the highest number of backward and aspirational districts, the Centre should intervene to assist the state in improving its socio-economic condition. Agarwal had said that the state had certain geographical constraints as it is landlocked and lacked in mineral wealth. He also asked for subsidies and concessions for the sugar industry and initiatives for agriculture startups for rural youth. “I cannot comment on the lack of announcements for specific projects, but I am confident that once the details of the Budget are clear, UP would turn out to be a big beneficiary,” Agarwal told TOI.

Lucknow,Duty on CCTV cameras may deal blow to e-surveillance,"LUCKNOW: The proposal to increase customs duty on CCTV cam eras and digital video recorders (DVRs) is threatening to burn a hole in the pocket of city residents who are already grappling with a rise in incidents of burglary and theft. Dealers say the surveillance system business in the city is annually worth around Rs 5 crore. On an average, over 3,000 CCTV cameras, along with items like DVRs, monitors, hard discs and cables needed to operate them, are sold. Around 90% buyers go for basic models costing between Rs 3,000 and Rs 20,000. These are made in India and the customs duty hike will have no impact on them. However, accessories required to run these cameras are mostly imported ones. Hence, their cost will increase, resulting in an additional financial burden of around Rs 500-2,000 per item. On the other hand, 10% buyers, mostly government and private establishments like apartments, banks and malls, opt for artificial intelligence-based high-end CCTV cameras imported from the US and Japan. They cost between Rs 90,000 and Rs 5 lakh each. “The demand for surveillance systems increased at a rate of 10% till 2018. However, this year, we have seen an increase of 25% because more people are becoming aware of personal security amid a spurt in burglaries. The camera is a cheaper option for them in comparison to employing security guards,” said Anil Kumar Srivastava, a dealer in Nishatganj. A dealer of high-end CCTV cameras, Aniket Juneja said after the spate of burglaries in Gomtinagar, not just apartment residents, but also restaurants and shops were installing surveillance systems. “This year alone, we have supplied around 150 AI-based CCTV cameras.” Usman Rizvi — a leading provider of security solutions — said in two years, the cost of hiring private security guards had increased by four times, as a result more people were buying surveillance cameras.

Lucknow,Corporators wait for LMC funds,"LUCKNOW: The LMC budget proposal plans to boost development, but street lightning, laying of water and sewage pipes and interlocking of inner streets in various wards of the city are pending because it has not released around Rs 45 crore of corporator development funds due since March. The city has 110 wards and each corporator gets Rs 95 lakh per annum for development work. The first instalment of Rs 45 lakh each is released in March and the second of Rs 50 lakh each in September. It is July and corporators are yet to receive the first instalment. While major development work such as construction of main roads, laying of sewage and water pipes, lighting up streets, garbage collection and cleaning of drains is carried out by the LMC workforce, the funds allotted to corporators are mostly used to resolve small, but crucial issues. Many corporators use their funds for construction or repair of inner roads, cementing drains, pavement interlocking, maintenance of parks and repair of streetlights. Such tasks are piling up in various wards. At various wards under Mahanagar, residents complained of potholed road that have not been fixed in two years. Chandan Tripathi, a resident of Sector H, said: “We face problem of waterlogging every monsoon. We have complained to our local corporator, but he says he has not received funds from LMC.” Residents of Indiranagar complained of poor sewerage. Sector 12 resident Tarun Jaiswal said, “Sewers were laid in 2009, but the quantity of sewage has increased in 10 years. So, all the dirty water overflows and floods roads.” Daliganj corporator Mukesh Shukla conceded that development work was pending owing to lack of funds. Shukla said he and other corporators had decided to raise the issue at the LMC house meeting on Sunday. Additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh claimed they had not received funds from the government. “As soon as we get it, we shall release the first instalment.” "
Lucknow,Megabucks to make Lucknow cleaner &amp; smarter,"LUCKNOW: The LMC has allocated over 40% of its 2019-20 budget for 4‘S’ — Smart City, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, sewer and sadak (road). And, all this without levying any new taxes or increasing existing ones. The annual budget, proposing Rs 2,012 crore expenditure, will be tabled at the house meeting on Sunday for approval. It is 12% or Rs 241 crore more than that of last fiscal’s Rs 1,771 expenditure. Of the total expenses proposed, Rs 1,708 is for development work. This includes Rs 300 crore for Smart City projects, Rs 230 for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Rs 220 crore under AMRUT scheme for laying sewer/water pipelines and Rs 110 crore for road construction and repairs. Other expenditure include Rs 10 crore for cleaning drains, Rs 14 crore for streetlights and Rs 7 crore for maintenance of parks, besides Rs 90 crore as development funds for corporators of all the 110 wards. In comparison to last year, the maximum increase in budget has been for AMRUT — from Rs 116 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 220 crore in 2019-20 —followed by road repairs, from Rs 90 crore to Rs 110 crore. While 75% of the revenue for the expenses will come as grants from central and state governments for various projects as well as allocation by 14th Finance Commission, the LMC will generate Rs 600 crore through its own resources like house tax and auction of parking lots and advertising slots. Several other important decision on proposals like providing civic services to Gomtinagar and Jankipuram extensions, and regularising of food vans will also be tabled for approval. "
Lucknow,"Special police ops, projects yet to see the light of day","LUCKNOW: Three special operations and plans announced by Lucknow police in the past two years to check crime are gathering dust in files. The most promising among them was Operation Prahar, announced after the murder of a cash van guard near Raj Bhavan in August 2018. Likewise, after back-to-back dacoities in January-February 2018, it was said that a comprehensive criminal database would be prepared. The third proposal was to train police like ATS so that hostage situations could be tackled well. Under Operation Prahar, police were supposed to reach the crime scene in 2-3 minutes and immediately issue an alert to all police stations to set up road blockades, intensify patrolling and barricade borders to stop the accused from fleeing Lucknow. Since the announcement was made, 15 murders, 20 shootings and six loots have taken place, but cops have failed to respond as proposed. In the latest incident on June 30, businessman Manoj Bhattacharya was shot dead near Charbagh station. Police took 15 minutes to respond. Similarly, in Thakurganj, when tent house owner Chhotu Lodhi was shot dead on May 18, police arrived 10 minutes late. In February 2018, then Lucknow SSP Deepak Kumar had proposed a comprehensive computer database of criminals with fingerprints, photographs, area of operation and their sympathisers after 14 dacoities took place in the district within a month.  However, police have not been able to create such a database till date. Had it been in place, it would have helped them crack burglaries that have taken place in the past month and is suspected to be the handiwork of one gang. While no hostage crisis has taken place so far, the fact that the third proposal wasn’t implemented means police are likely to have a tough time if there’s one. "
Lucknow,"Banker, varsity accountant in ED net for SUV fleets, 7-star holidays","LUCKNOW: A former bank manager and the accountant of an agriculture institute – a deemed university — landed in the Enforcement Directorate (ED) dragnet after they booked by police for fraudulently withdrawing over Rs 24 crore from its bank account by misusing their positions. The bank manager and institute accountant came on police radar when they went on a spree purchasing a fleet of high end SUVs, flats and for holidaying at seven-star hotels, which was grossly disproportionate to their known sources of income. Kamal Ahsan, manager of a private bank, in connivance with the university accountant, Rajesh Kumar withdrew over Rs 24 crore from the institution’s account in the bank from 2013 to 2016 by misusing their positions, said ED officials. Initially, in March 2017, police registered a case in connection with inexplicable withdrawals from the bank account of the university. The case was transferred to ED in October 2017. ED officials told TOI on Saturday that around 11 more staffers of the institute are under the scanner for conniving in the crime. “We have attached assets of the accused, which includes 17 immovable properties worth around Rs. 3.18 crore, mutual fund investments of around Rs 85 lakh and around Rs 58 lakhs lying in bank accounts of both accused, their family members, friends, and relatives. More searches will be carried out in the coming weeks,” said a senior ED official. The official said that the scam came to notice when colleagues of Ahsan noticed him coming to office in a high-end car while the co-workers of Kumar also reported his using a high-end SUV. Both also went on holidays and stayed at seven-star hotels. The respective authorities carried out internal probes and then informed police. Ahsan and Kumar used to withdraw money from the university’s accounts. They fabricated bank statements to hide the cash withdrawals and submitted them to the university. "
Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh government posts 560 cops to check power theft,"LUCKNOW: The state government on Saturday ordered posting of 560 policemen in UP Power Corporation Limited on a deputation period of two years with the aim of curbing high line losses that are denting its revenue. Following the order, 10 inspectors, 190 sub-inspectors and 360 constables would be posted at police check posts dedicated to take up power theft cases. Soon after coming to power, the Yogi government had decided to create a police check post in every district to handle power theft cases. “The deployment of police will help in checking power theft,” said principal secretary, energy, Alok Kumar. The move, sources said, was necessitated by incidents of power employees being attacked during anti-power theft drives. A week earlier, energy minister Shrikant Sharma had ordered snapping of power connections of consumers having electricity load of 5Kw and above with unpaid electricity bills for two months. The decision to create dedicated police units to check power theft was initially taken in Akhilesh Yadav government but the move did not take off and was kept pending in the cabinet. "
Ghaziabad,"CBI raids sacked I-T commissioner’s house, former office","NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered an FIR under sections of cheating and forgery against sacked income tax commissioner S K Srivastava and conducted a raid at his house in Noida while probing allegations that the senior IRS officer backdated orders on I-T appeals to show that he had settled the cases before June 10 when was compulsorily retired. The search operation, which started on Friday morning and continued till Saturday, took place at 13 locations in Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad, including at Srivastava’s Pandara Road residence, his former office in Noida and, also, at the boutique his wife runs in Vasant Kunj. It is alleged that Srivastava who was serving as commissioner, income tax (appeals), Noida passed 104 backdated orders in June, 2019. While he compulsorily retired on June 10, 2019, these orders were uploaded on the income tax business application (ITBA) between June 11 and June 13 using the RSA token to log into what is a secure system. The orders were shown to have been dispatched on June 7, 2019, i.e. three days before he was sacked, whereas they had , in fact, been sent on June 14, 2019. Moreover, 13 of the “ backdated” orders concerned cases which did not fall under Srivastava’s jurisdiction. The CBI has recovered jewellery worth Rs 2.47 crore, Rs 16.44 lakh in cash, watches approximately valued at Rs 10 lakh from his residence, sources said. Bank deposits to the tune of Rs 1.30 crore in the name of Srivastava and his family members were also found during the raid.

Lucknow,"Flats with imported tiles, bath fittings to cost up to Rs 5 lakh more in Lucknow","LUCKNOW: High-end apartments and row houses in the city are set to become more expensive with the decision of the finance minister to impose 5% customs duty on imported tiles, marble, metal fittings, furniture and windows. The impact will mean escalation in the cost of around 2,800 high-end flats and bungalows under construction in the city. According to experts, these imported items are generally used in high-end houses costing more than Rs 50 lakh. Buyers of these properties prefer luxury fittings and furniture. The cost of imported tiles, marbles, furniture, windows and bathroom fittings is around 40% of the total cost of the house, depending on the quantity and quality of the products used. The overall cost of such under-construction houses can now go up by up to Rs 5 lakh. Prakhar Khanna, a government employee, said, “My 4BHK house is under construction in Gomtinagar Extension. I was planning to get Italian marble flooring in my house. However, now I have decided to drop the idea because imposition of customs duty will increase the prices, taking them beyond my budget.”Businessman Jatin Krishna said, “My family and I were planning to purchase imported furniture, but won’t be able to now as the increase in taxes has taken the price out of my reach."" According to officials of Lucknow Development Authority, more than 1,200 highend flats being constructed by it will be affected by the decision. Flats with total area of 1,200 sq ft or above made for higher income group (HIG) buyers will now see an increase in price. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Lucknow Chapter) told TOI that as many as four big private projects coming up in Chinhat and Matiyari and on Dewa Road and Sitapur Road with around 1,600 flats in them will see a 5% increase in the principle amount. The budget of underconstruction government and private buildings to be used as offices or for other commercial purpose would also go up, experts said. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Woman missing, dad alleges torture by her in-laws","GHAZIABAD: The father of a 23-year-old woman has lodged a police complaint alleging that his daughter has been missing since Saturday morning because of alleged torture by her parents-in-law. There was speculation that the woman, Komal Talan, might have committed suicide by jumping into the Hindon canal in Indirapuram as her car was found parked nearby. However, divers did not find her body despite hours of search. Later on Saturday evening, Komal’s father Anil Talan lodged the missing person’s complaint. Talan alleged that Komal, who was married to Delhi resident Abhishek, was being harassed over dowry. “We have found a note in Komal’s car that says she was being tortured by her parents-in-law over dowry,” said Talan, an office-bearer in the Bharati Kisan Union. “My wife called on Komal’s number around 5pm but it was switched off. Around 8.30pm, we received a call from her mother-in-law who informed that Komal had left home in the morning and hadn’t returned,” he added. Seeing an abandoned car near the canal, a cop passing by enquired about its details and informed Komal’s father. “Initially, we suspected that the woman may have committed suicide by jumping into the canal. But her body could not be traced. We spoke to her father, questioned her in-laws and lodged a missing person’s complaint,” said Shlok Kumar, SP (city). “The woman’s father has levelled allegations that her parents-in-law could be behind her disappearance,” he added. “However, it is a matter of investigation whether she has gone on her own or there is any foul play. For that, we need to trace her first,” said Kumar, adding that teams were looking for the woman in various other parts of the region. "
Kanpur,Trans-Hindon towns among worst hit as water table rings alarm bells,"GHAZIABAD: The trans-Hindon areas of Ghaziabad, places like Kaushambi, Vaishali and Indirapuram that have turned into addresses of choice for new settlers in NCR, are among the most exploited for groundwater, government data shows. The water table’s cumulative fall in the six years from 2013-2018, for which data is available, is 4.26 metres, but since the depth of the water table is an average of data recorded across the district, the number masks the sharp fall in some urban areas where it has fallen below 30 metres. Piezometer readings in urban areas of Ghaziabad also showed that of 38 spots where the Uttar Pradesh groundwater department measured the water table, 11 spots have gone dry. This means the water table has plummeted so much that it did not register in piezometer readings. Makanpur in Indirapuram is one of these spots. The others are Krishi Beej Bhandar (Kaushambi), Zila Ganna Adhikarai (Surya Nagar), Bhovapur, Hindon Motel (Patel Nagar), Civil Lines, Lajpat Nagar (Sahibabad), Sikandarpur and Police Lines. The water table has plunged below 30 metres at Vaishali, Maharajpur, Prahladgarhi, Jhandapur, CIPL (Sanjay Nagar), CGO complex (Hapur Road), government nursery (Kavinagar), Dundahera and Pasunda. In Vijay Nagar, it has fallen below 40 metres. Environmentalists say the responsibility for this lay squarely with government agencies, which have allowed rapid and large-scale urban activity in the city over the last few decades. Today, for instance, the Indirapuram-Vaishali-Vasundhara cluster, developed through housing schemes and licences, is a thickly populated one. Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist, said, “The Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) in 1998 had declared the municipal area of Ghaziabad a ‘notified area’, which means extraction of groundwater was banned for all purposes except drinking. Despite that, there is large-scale, illegal extraction of groundwater by various authorities, industries, residential and commercial complexes.” Raghav claimed he had copies of no-objection certificates to show that seven major industries cumulatively extract 1 crore litres of groundwater per day. “The numbers would be much higher if we calculate permission given to all industries,” added Raghav, pointing out that the NOCs are conditional and the industries have been asked to replenish groundwater in the same ratio at which they extract. “While some industries have been asked to adopt lakes and ponds to recharge groundwater, some are bound to take up harvesting but there is no mechanism to know whether they are following the conditions laid down or not,” he said. RB Kaushik, engineer (CGWA) said no new NOCs have been issued to any industry. “We have only renewed old NOCs and have not issued any new NOC,” Kaushik said. Raghav also claimed 2,403 hectares of waterbody area in Ghaziabad has been encroached on, making way for buildings and other infrastructure projects. The administration said steps have been taken to rejuvenate lakes and waterbodies. “In the recent past, we have freed close to 700 ponds and waterbodies of encroachments, which includes 133 in Ghaziabad, 469 in Modi Nagar and 101 in Loni tehsils,” said a district administration official. Though rainwater harvesting is mandatory for all group housing societies, monitoring remains an area of concern. “From time to time, we carry out inspections,” said VK Singh, officer on special duty with the GDA, which has administrative control of places like Indirapuram and Raj Nagar Extension. “We are also in the process of fine-tuning laws in which toilet and kitchen water will be compulsory used after treating it. This way, we hope to limit dependency on groundwater to a large extent,” added Singh. "

Ghaziabad,Protest after 2nd theft in society with 80 guards,"GHAZIABAD: Residents of Panchsheel Primrose in Kavi Nagar staged a protest on Saturday against a rise in thefts and burglaries in the area after a flat in the society was broken into and goods worth Rs 2.5 lakh stolen. This was the second case to be reported in the past two weeks. Residents alleged that despite the presence of 80 guards, such cases were being reported inside the society periodically. They staged a protest against local police and the builder alleging that no progress had been made in another theft case reported two weeks ago. The burglary, which triggered the protest, came to light after its owner, retired central government employee Gopal Krishna Gupta, returned home on Saturday. The flat had been closed for a long time as Gupta and his wife had gone to Pune and Chennai to visit their children. When they reached home and unlocked the door, they found the flat ransacked and cash and goods worth Rs 2.5 lakh missing. It is suspected that the burglars entered the house through the balcony. Another burglary was reported in the society on June 21. Residents claimed that the burglars had a similar modus operandi in that case. On Saturday, the protesters put a lock on the builder’s office in the morning, which was removed in the evening, though the protest went on till late in the evening. Anuradha Sharma, a resident, said, “We have been raising the issue of safety and security with the developer for a long time now, but no concrete steps have been taken from their side so far. Moreover, the society does not have a resident welfare association as yet.” SHO (Kavi Nagar) Raj Kumar Sharma met the residents and assured them of proper action in the case. Sharma said police patrolling would be conducted inside the society as well. “CCTV footage has been collected to identify the culprits in both the cases,” he said. "

The GDA plans to name the societies having such towers “bird flats”. “Ours is a generation that has grown up in small towns and villages, where we are used to seeing birds on out premises,” said the GDA official. “But in big cities, which are dotted with highrises, birds are hardly seen making nests in closed enclosures. In some way, we are also responsible for the loss of their habitats,” he added. A few weeks ago, the official made a proposal to build bird towers before the GDA vice-chairperson, who agreed to the idea. “The plan is to install a 12ft iron tower at a vantage location inside a housing society, preferably in green and shady areas,” said Kanchan Verma, the GDA vice-chairperson. “We will place small wooden boxes around the towers where we hope birds will build their nests,” she added. The vice-chairperson said each tower could house 100-120 wooden compartments for birds to build nests. The GDA plans to implement the idea with help from the RWAs. “It would take around Rs 40,000 to build a tower housing the wooden boxes. I think RWAs can afford to spend that much. If they can’t, the GDA will pitch in. We will, however, have to work out the modalities,” the official said. Environmentalists, however, are not sure if the GDA’s idea would take wing. “The area for a bird flat needs to be chosen carefully. It has to be shady and protected from rain and sun. Finding such a spot in every housing society will be a challenge,” said Ruchin Verma, a city-based environmentalist. “Also, we need to be very specific about the size of the wooden boxes. They should be able to accommodate birds of every size,” added Mehra. As example, Mehra said house sparrows and bulbul would need smaller wooden houses, while pigeons, rock cat bird, mynah and parrots may need bigger nests. “The idea at the very face of it looks good, but the GDA would need to talk to experts before going about this plan.” said Mehra.

Ghaziabad,17% of Indian cities and towns face water shortage; TN tops list,"NEW DELHI: About 17% notified cities and towns in India face water shortage, according to a list prepared by the central government. Among the states, Tamil Nadu has maximum number of such urban areas followed by Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. All the four municipal areas in Delhi including the posh NDMC zone have been included in the list of 756 “water stressed” urban areas out of total 4,378 which are governed by municipal bodies. All urban areas surrounding the national capital such as Ghaziabad, Noida and Faridabad have been facing similar shortage. According to the list, two smaller northern states - Punjab and Haryana - have high number of municipal areas where water availability is less which officials said could be due to falling water table because of increased extraction of ground water for irrigation. While in Punjab 82 municipal areas (nearly half of all notified urban areas) face water shortage, in Haryana their number is 52 out of total 86 notified urban areas. The housing and urban affairs ministry has come out with the names of cities and towns on the lines of Jal Shakti ministry, which has identified 255 districts and 1,597 blocks as water stressed. The urban affairs ministry has also prepared a plan to undertake intensive campaign and undertake activities for water conservation, recycle and reuse of grey water. Unlike in rural areas where central government teams have started visiting the designated districts, in this case, the Centre has asked states and urban local bodies (ULBs) to carry out focused activities in two phases; July 1 to September 15 and October 1 to November 30. It has circulated a template for effective monitoring of the activities and performance on implementation of rainwater harvesting, rejuvenation of water bodies, reuse of treated waste water and plantation. “The progress needs to be monitored on a real-time basis to ascertain the progress of ULBs and gaps therein in each of the thrust areas under Jal Shakti Abhiyan,” the urban affairs ministry has said. It has also asked all urban local bodies to set up a cell for effective monitoring of rainwater harvesting and revival of at least one water body in their respective areas. The “Rainwater Harvesting Cell” will monitor the extent of groundwater extraction and groundwater aquifer recharge. Moreover, they will have to display the information at prominent locations for public awareness The ministry has asked ULBs to ensure all new building permissions must have rainwater harvesting structures incorporated as per building by-laws and its compliance should be checked before issuing occupancy-cum-completion certificate.

Lucknow,Maharajganj SDM shunted out by Yogi Adityanath for lax work,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday ordered transfer of Maharajganj’s SDM Sadar, Satyam Mishra, for dereliction of duty and non-performance. Maharajganj comes under Gorakhpur division. This was the first action ordered by the CM after holding a review of works done at the divisional level. The removal of SDM in Gorakhpur division is significant since it’s Yogi’s political backyard and he has represented Gorakhpur for five consecutive terms in Lok Sabha. Presiding over a review meeting of Gorakhpur division — which comprises Kushinagar, Deoria and Maharajganj — to assess the progress of development works, Yogi bluntly said that officials would not be retained if they failed to deliver on the priorities set by the state government. “The state government has adopted a zero tolerance policy towards corruption and dereliction of duty,” he told officials. Two Padrauna power engineers removedThe CM has also sought explanation from Deoria chief medical officer Dr Dhirendra Kumar, CMO Kushinagar Dr Haricharan Singh and CMO Maharajganj Kshama Shankar Pandey over their alleged laxity in performing duties. Yogi also ordered removal of two executive engineers of the power department in Padrauna — Hansraj Kaushal and AH Khan. Padrauna, which comes under Gorakhpur division, has reported frequent power outages and recurrent line losses resulting in revenue losses to the power department. Later while holding a review meeting in Gorakhpur, Yogi ordered suspension of three power engineers, including executive engineer AK Singh, Sub-divisional officer Pratush Balab and Junior engineer Arun Chaudharry for irregularities in underground cabling works under integrated Power Development Scheme. Recently, the CM had ordered forced retirement of 200 employees and action against over 400 employees after reviewing works in various state departments. "
Lucknow,Cloud cover and showers likely for next 2-3 days in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: The weatherman has predicted similar conditions for next two-three days. The city continued to receive intermittent light to moderate rainfall keeping the mercury below 30 degrees on Sunday too. Most parts of the city remained under the cloud cover keeping the weather pleasant all day on Sunday. The maximum and the minimum temperatures were recorded 34.3 and 26.6 degree Celsius with relative humidity as high as 100%.

Lucknow,Bonded labour: Freedom for two girls after 14 years,"LUCKNOW: Fourteen years after four girls from Jharkhand were allegedly “sold off” to an illegal maid hiring agency in Delhi, two of them have been rescued in the city. The girls, who are now in their 20s, had been working as bonded labourers in two separate houses here for the past 14 years. The third girl had escaped from a house in 2011, while the fourth girl is missing. This unfolded when the mother of the fourth girl lodged a missing complaint with a Delhi-based NGO. The duo was rescued by the state women and child welfare department’s women distress cell — Aapki Sakhi Asha Jyoti Kendra — from two homes in Aliganj and Rajajipuram on Friday and Saturday, respectively . The girls were working in the homes of a doctor and retired government official, both of whom are relatives. The girls, natives of Simko in Jharkhand’s west Singhum district, were sold off to Delhi based agency in 2005. The agency then sold them to the four families in Lucknow. Investigations have revealed that the girls were not paid a single penny by the families in the past 14 years. “The four girls are around 24-year-old now. They were taken to Delhi by a man on the pretext of providing job, but were instead sold off to a maid hiring agency. The girls were ‘bought’ by a big family of seven siblings in Lucknow,” said in-charge, Asha Jyoti Kendra, Archana Singh. “The family member who took these girls from the agency, had given a fake Delhi address and had kept the girls in Lucknow instead,” she added. One of the girls escaped in 2011 and married a man of her choice in Lucknow and is based here. She provided vital information when we approached her, said Singh. Last year, mother of the third Jharkhand girl, who is missing, approached a Delhi-based NGO seeking held to trace her daughter. “The mother met us with a representative of the same maid hiring agency. The representative told us that girls were in Lucknow. We then approached the Lucknow Police on May 25, but they refused to lodge our complaint,” said Renu Toora, who heads the Delhi-based NGO. “Since the police were not helpful, we went to the Child Welfare Committee. But since the girls are not minors, the CWC asked Asha Jyoti Kendra to intervene in the matter,” Toora added. In a joint rescue operation with the help of the girl who had escaped from her employer’s home earlier, the other two girls were located. “Even when we were searching for them, the family members kept misguiding us and denied having employed any of the girls. They cooked up stories, but we finally got hold of the girls,” said Archana Singh. "

Lucknow,"Airport, Charbagh inundated again: Rain washes away LMC’s tall claims","LUCKNOW: Sunday afternoon rain caused inconvenience to travellers from the city as it led to heavy waterlogging at Amausi airport and Charbagh railway stations. The 100-metre stretch from the entrance area till domestic terminal of Amausi airport turned into a pond after the downpour. As a result, travellers were forced to take a longer route from the international terminal side to reach the domestic terminal. Passengers coming to Charbagh station, too, found it difficult to reach the platforms. Abhinav, who had to board a train to Gorakhpur, struggled to reach the platform with his luggage.

Ghaziabad,"Owner enters Crossings flat lying locked for a year, finds it occupied","GHAZIABAD: Sunil Yadav’s flat in Crossings Republik had been lying locked for the past one year. The Delhi resident thought of giving it out on rent and even contacted a property dealer recently. On Sunday, when he visited the flat to check if the electricity and water connections needed repairs, he found his furnished house occupied. An inquiry revealed Yadav’s flat in Panchsheel Wellington had been given out on rent by a woman named Megha Tyagi, who had got a duplicate key made.  Megha was not the property dealer Yadav had contacted recently. “The flat had been lying vacant ever since my shifted to stay with us in Delhi. Recently, I decided to give out the flat on rent and contacted a property dealer in Crossings Republik. We have even finalised a deal with family,” said Yadav, a deputy manager with a private firm. Yadav (37), who lives in Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Phase 1, seldom visits his flat in Crossings Republik. On June 30, however, he visited the flat to check if the fans and lights were working fine and sign the agreement with the family to whom he had agreed to give out the house on rent. “To my utter surprise, when I opened the door, I found eight to nine bags lying in a room. The family with whom I had struck a deal said the bags did not belong to them. I opened the bags and found a resume and a phone number on it,” Yadav said. The private firm manager called on the number on the resume and the person who picked up the call said he and his two friends had taken the house on rent a week ago. They said they had paid a month’s rent and a security amount to Megha, who had asked them to shift to the flat from July 1. When Yadav spoke to Megha, she blamed one Sumit for giving them the duplicate key. “I don’t know who else have lived in this flat. The maintenance office should have looked into it as no tenant can live in the society without its permission,” Yadav said. Police sources said flat owners should check on their property at regular intervals as there have been instances earlier of houses being rented out or even sold in the absence of inspections. Yadav has filed a police complaint, but an FIR was yet to be registered till late on Sunday evening. Rahul Sharma, the maintenance manager at Panchsheel Wellington, said no permission had been given to the three youths to stay in Yadav’s flat. “There is no signature of any maintenance official on the tenants’ approval letter. The complainant should take up the matter with the property dealer and find how he/she got the key,” he said. "

Kanpur,"Two prisoners escape from prison, one run over by train","KANPUR: Two prisoners escaped from Etawah district jail by scaling the boundary wall on early Sunday. However, one of them was run over while trying to board a train. Ramanand (45) and Chandra Prakash (40), who were serving life sentences in separate cases, escaped from the jail around 2am.

Lucknow,"Sex racket angle in Sitapur rape being probed, says SP","LUCKNOW: The main accused in the Sitapur school gang rape and torment case, a 25-year-old female teacher, was detained along with her two co-accused brothers from Maholi thana area in the presence of the SP on Sunday. ""The three are being interrogated by a police team comprising an ASP-rank officer, a circle officer and the SHO (Maholi). I am personally monitoring the case,"" SP LR Kumar told TOI. Addressing a joint news conference with the DM in Sitapur, SP LR Kumar said police had searched the homes of the accused and scanned their phones, but did not find evidence to confirm that the girl was drugged or that whatever happened was filmed. On whether other schoolgirls were put through the same ordeal as alleged, the SP said, ""We spoke to other girls in the school and village, but have so far found nothing to indicate there were more victims. Investigations are on to look into all allegations."" The promptness in police action comes within a day of this newspaper publishing a report on the possibility of a drugs and sex ring operating in the school for two years, based on the statement recorded by the 15-year-old gang rape survivor before a magistrate on July 2 under Section 164, CrPC. ""We are looking into the aspect of videos and images as alleged. So far, we have not found any other victim (who was drugged and raped as alleged by the girl in her statement),"" the SP said, adding that they had applied for compensation for the survivor from a designated fund as per rules. Of the five accused, one Ghanshyam (20) was arrested on Thursday. He is a cousin of the said teacher. The fifth youth, also her cousin, is on the run while the teacher and her brothers were being grilled till the time of filing this report. Advocate Arun Kumar Pandey, who practises in Sitapur civil court and is fighting the case on behalf of the girl, said if arrests were not made by Monday morning, they would fax an application to the DGP and also upload the same on the CM's grievance redress portal. ""The Maholi SHO has been intimidating the girl and her family. He is trying to dilute the charges against the accused. We want him removed or shifting of the case to any of the other 24 police stations. A formal application will be made to CM and DGP tomorrow (Monday),"" Pandey told TOI. "

Kanpur,"Kanpur tanneries to reopen, with riders","KANPUR: The leather industry in Kanpur hailed the state government’s move to reopen tanneries, but urged the government to fast-track work on setting up effluent treatment plants to check pollution. Most tannery owners are concerned about survival of their units due to the rider on restricted production. “Government and UPPCB must consider the break-even line of production or industry would sink,” said Asad Iraqi, owner of a tannery. Talking to TOI, Iraqi said every infrastructure has a minimum production quotient and the unit would collapse if this is not maintained. UPPCB officials will have to raise the minimum production limit while imposing conditions, said Iraqi. Echoing this view, Mukhaturl Amin, former chairman of the council for leather export said the government should expedite work on ETP and complete it at the earliest so that the industry can operate in full capacity. The completion of ETP would help tanneries maintain industry parameters and check level of pollutants in effluents at the same time. He said the state government has displayed positivity, but limiting production would shackle the industry, said Amin. Dr Firoz Alam, general secretary, Small Tannery Association said, restrictions imposed on tanneries were to reduce production by 50% and reduce infrastructure accordingly. He suggested installation of CCTVs in units to check production and infrastructure limits at the units. The pollution control board should first allow the tannery to run and then issue notice on additional infrastructure, he said. However, he claimed reduced production and infrastructure would damage the industry. Gulam Mohiuddin, another member of leather industry, said seven-month hibernation period had damaged the industry and the reduced production limits would be of no help to the industry to recover loss. The government should expedite work on ETP, he said. "
Kanpur,"UP ATS arrests couple in Bhopal, probes Naxal link","LUCKNOW: A middle-aged couple from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh was arrested from posh Shahpura locality in Bhopal on Monday on charges of concealing their identity. The Anti-Terrorist squad, which picked up the couple from the MP capital, suspect they were in touch with a Naxalite outfit. Investigators claim the couple had figured in a 2018 video of a meeting with the guerrillas. The Intelligence Bureau is in possession of the footage of this meeting, where revival of a Naxalite outfit in UP was being discussed. After arresting the couple, sleuths searched two locations in Deoria and one in Kanpur after the inmates were found to be in touch with the arrested couple. During the searches, sleuths claim to have recovered documents and correspondence with listed Naxalite outfits. Those arrested in Bhopal were Manish Srivastava and his wife Varsha, who were putting up as tenants for last two years. They were unemployed, but regularly paid rent and could not provide any convincing explanation for residing in Bhopal since 2017. Investigators also recovered Rs 1.25 lakh from their possession along with Maoist literature. “We stumbled upon correspondence between the couple and the banned guerrilla groups,” said ADG ATS Asim Arun. He said investigators were yet to establish a direct link between the couple and Naxalite outfits, so they have been booked for concealing identity. Relevant sections of IPC will be added once their Naxalite links are established, he said.

Lucknow,Shift case out of Sitapur: Girl’s father to ADG,"LUCKNOW: In an application faxed to ADG (Lucknow zone) on Monday, the father of the 15-year-old Sitapur student who was allegedly sedated, gang-raped and filmed on her school campus has sought transfer of the case outside the district, stressing that local police were pressuring them to “reach a compromise” with the accused. Since ADG (Lucknow) exercises jurisdiction over Sitapur, the letter faxed to 05222235399 also urges him to provide security to the survivor and her family who are allegedly facing threats from the SHO of Maholi thana and the accused — a female teacher of the government school, her two brothers and two cousins, one of whom has been arrested. “We are being threatened. My daughter was once quizzed in front of the accused. We don’t think the case can be fairly and impartially investigated here (Sitapur). We want the case to be shifted outside the district so that my daughter gets justice,” the father of the girl reiterated while speaking to TOI on Monday. The student, who was 13 years old when her alleged ordeal began two years ago, had recorded her statement before a judicial magistrate on July 2 under Section 164 of the CrPC. She has claimed she is not the only victim in the case and that other schoolgirls were similarly targeted. While police arrested one of the accused named in the FIR on July 4, they have not taken action against the others. A joint news conference, convened by DM Akhilesh Tiwari and SP LR Kumar on Sunday, summarised that the investigations so far had not substantiated the allegations of use of drugs to rape the student and making of video clips. In the letter to ADG (Lucknow zone), the father of the girl has once again demanded arrest of the all the others — the 25-year-old prime accused teacher and three youths — named in the FIR lodged under Sections 376-D (gang rape), 328 (use of intoxicating substance with the intent to cause hurt) and 504 (criminal intimidation). The plea to ADG also mentions that Maholi police were pressuring the family to get the FIR “expunged”. “Police and administration are trying to dilute the charges without a thorough probe. My daughter’s blood tests were not done to check if she was drugged. They are trying to give a gang rape case a different spin. Sarasar na insaafi hai (This is grave injustice),” the father said. "
Lucknow,"Water table shrinks, gallons of rainwater go down drain","LUCKNOW: Over 6,500 million litres of rainwater go waste in the city every year because the housing watchdog has not been able to enforce a government order that makes harvesting structures mandatory for residential buildings with a rooftop area of more than 200sqm. According to Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) records, 5.48 lakh households have come up after 2004. All have a rooftop area of 200sqm or more, but few harvest the 900mm rainfall the city receives annually. “As per calculations by the UP Ground Water Department (UPGWD), a house with 200sqm rooftop can recharge groundwater with 118 million litres in a year. If all the 5.48 lakh households have harvesting facilities, 6,545 million litres of rainwater can be used to recharge groundwater,” said RS Sinha, senior hydrologist and former deputy director of UPGWD. The order, originally issued in 2001, had directed housing boards to ensure buildings with 1,000sqm rooftops or more had facility for rainwater harvesting. The order was modified in 2003 and 2006. In 2017, the rooftop parameter was reduced to 200sqm after a survey by the Central Ground Water Board revealed that groundwater in nearly two-thirds of the state was declining at a fast pace. The onus of implementing the order in the city is on Lucknow Development Authority (LDA). Monsoon entered Lucknow last week and if LDA officials are to be believed, around 50,000 households in the city have rainwater harvesting. But, officials are not aware if all are functional. Even if 50,000 is deducted from the total number, as many as 4.98 lakh houses do not harvest rainwater. This, UPGWD calculations show, results in 6,543 million litres of rainwater being wasted. LDA chief engineer Indushekhar Singh said he had no idea why the order was not followed since 2001. “But after I joined in 2017, I ensured its implementation. We approve only those building plans that have provision for rainwater harvesting. We take Rs 1.5 lakh as security money, which is refunded after inspection to verify the facility has been installed,” he said. Senior hydrologist Anupam said apart from spreading mass awareness, there should be a mechanism to enforce the order on buildings and houses built after 2001. He also said at present, around 4 lakh million litres of groundwater are being pumped out yearly and if the situation remains the same, the city might face water shortage like Chennai in coming years. Sinha, who now runs Groundwater Action Group, a body of water conservationists, summed it up best. “Rainwater harvesting projects cost Rs 7,000-10,000—a nominal price to pay considering the gravity of the situation.” "
Lucknow,Speeding behind every third road accident in Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW: Speeding tops the list of reasons behind road accidents in Uttar Pradesh, according to an assessment of data of the ministry of road transport and highways. The data also reveal that one in three road accidents in the state happens because the speed limit is breached. In 14,276 out of 38,783 crashes that took place in UP in 2017, drivers violated speed norms. ‘Driving on the wrong side’ accounted for 12% of accidents on highways. ‘Drunken driving’ was the culprit in another 8% accidents. And, ‘use of mobile phones while driving’ led to loss of vehicular control that led to accidents in yet another 8% cases. “The death of 29 persons on Greater Noida expressway is not just one incident. There is no dearth of data to prove that there’s an urgent need to improve enforcement on our highways,” said Piyush Tewari, CEO, Savelife Foundation, a nonprofit that works for the cause of road safety. Tewari maintained that there was also need to address the issue of road engineering on an urgent basis. “Most of our highways are missing crash barriers and other infrastructure measures that can prevent an accident from becoming fatal. This is pandemic and needs to be addressed at policy and ground levels,” he added. The report also noted that the percentage share of UP in total road accidents across India is the fourth highest at 8.3%. Also, UP ranks first in terms of the number of road casualties at 13.6%. The most unfortunate thing is that over 53% of deceased are below 35 years. Road safety crusader Ashutosh Soti said while law enforcement was essential to check these “preventable deaths”, encouraging people to follow traffic rules was equally important. “If people follow rules, accidents may be prevented to a great extent,” he stressed.

Lucknow,40% head &amp; tail collisions: Yamuna Expressway data shows 1 death every 4 days,"LUCKNOW: The deathtrap Yamuna Expressway spanning 165km has recorded 5,706 accidents till May 2019, according to UP Traffic Directorate data. Number crunching pegs the accident rate at one in every four days, since the first crash on August 9, 2012 — days after its inauguration. Data compiled by Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) between Jan 1, 2016 and May 2019, shows 1,176 accidents (40%) were triggered by head-and-tail collision, which includes stranded and moving vehicles. And at least 474 accidents were caused by speeding and another 1,228 from miscellaneous factors. The death toll in this period stands at 462 with 4,907 people suffering injuries. Data also shows the accident rate dipping by 45% to 659 in this period and 236 casualties being recorded this year till May. The highest number of accidents — 1,219 — took place in 2016 while the lowest of 659 was recorded in 2018. Senior YEIDA officials told TOI that on recommendations of Supreme Court, a road safety audit on the 165km stretch was conducted by IIT-Delhi team, but no black spots were found. Officials also claimed that prima facie it shows accidents on this stretch were caused by errant drivers. "
Lucknow,Driver dozed off or picked max speed in 5 min,"LUCKNOW: The Janrath bus that crashed into a divider on the Yamuna expressway and plunged into a drain early Monday was fitted with a speed-limiting device (SLD) that allows maximum acceleration of 80 kmph. But if a 60-tonne bus picks up maximum speed in a five-minute span, it could spin out of control. Senior UPSRTC officials who are probing the accident say this is what could have happened as the expressway parapet had tyre marks. “The bus first jumped onto the parapet, hit an iron rod below and then plunged into the gorge,” said a senior official. The driver, Kripashankar Chaudhary, was not familiar with the route and finally came on track after passengers pointed out that he was on wrong course, said sources. He was engaged for the trip to accommodate a huge rush of examinees who came to Lucknow earlier in the day, said senior UPSRTC officials. The accident site is the intersection point of the Yamuna and Agra expressways. No CCTV cameras are in place and it’s difficult to track the bus’ trajectory before the crash, said an official. Principal secretary, transport, Aradhana Shukla, said, “The driver had come for night duty and was scheduled to drive a bus to Ghazipur, but there were not enough passengers on the route. So, he was told to go to Delhi. This is a routine reshuffle.” The driver, who also died in the accident, had joined UPSRTC in 2005. He was transferred to Awadh depot (Lucknow region) two years ago. Since January, he had driven buses for over 23,000 km. Also, he resumed duty after three-day rest, said sources. “His eyesight was good and he had no health issues. We are investigating if he had consumed alcohol,” said an UPSRTC official. Based on survivors’ account, the driver dozed off before the tragedy. “The accident site is hardly 5km ahead of the toll plaza and it was just a 5-minute drive from the plaza. How the driver could have suddenly dozed off is tough to imagine,” said the official. The accident’s impact can be gauged from the fact that the two front wheels came off on the expressway and the chassis and body fell into the gorge.The bus was comparatively new as it was inducted into the fleet in 2017. It was thoroughly checked and maintained before the journey. The driver had no history of accidents and operated the same bus on several occasions. "
Lucknow,29 dead as bus falls through gap between e-way flyovers,"AGRA: In the worst-ever crash on the Yamuna Expressway, 29 people were killed and 23 others injured when an Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) bus plunged 40 feet into a drain between two flyovers after breaking through the safety railing on the high-speed stretch near Agra early on Monday. The two-tiered AC sleeper bus, known as Jan Rath seva, was cruising at a high speed when it crashed at 4.05am at Etmadpur, 4km from Agra, near Milestone 161 of the expressway. It fell upside down into a drain called Jharna Nullah, which had about six-eight feet of water. “Prima facie, it appears that the driver fell asleep at the wheel. The bus was speeding, which caused it to jump off the flyover's railing,” Agra district magistrate N G Ravi Kumar said. So far this year, 135 people have died in 302 accidents on the Yamuna Expressway. The toll is higher than all of last year, when 111 lives were lost on the stretch, as per figures released by Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday. The driver, identified as Kripa Shankar Chaudhary, was among those killed. Senior superintendent of police Babloo Kumar said, “Twenty-nine passengers, including a 2.5-year-old kid and 20-year-old woman, were killed in the accident. Another 23 were injured. They are being provided treatment.” The bus with 52 passengers and two crew members was heading to Delhi’s Anand Vihar ISBT from Lucknow’s Alambagh depot. Agra police confirmed the identities of all 29 dead, who hailed from Lucknow (11), Ghaziabad (2), Delhi (2), Gorakhpur (2), Basti (2), Rae Bareli (3), Pune (1), Bhojpur, Bihar (1), Gonda (1), Kurukshetra (1), Barabanki (1), Mirzapur (1) and one from an unidentified district. The Yamuna Expressway is one of the most modern roads in the country but the high-speed stretch is also notorious for its fatal crashes. A total of 944 deaths have been reported on the expressway since it was commissioned in August 2012. Major (retired) Manish Singh, in-charge coordinator of the expressway, said, “It seems the driver of the speeding bus fell asleep at the wheel. The bus crashed through the reinforced concrete railing and dropped 40 feet to the drain through the gap between two flyovers.” “Since our team was at Milestone 165 where a truck driver was killed around 12.30am in a hit-and-run accident, we moved our entire machinery, including cranes, ambulances and rescue team to the accident site within minutes and the rescue operation was started,” Singh said. Dilip Shrivastav, a 35-year-old resident of Eldeco II in Lucknow who was heading to Delhi to attend an official meeting, said, “I don’t know how the bus plunged into the nullah. All of us were trying to escape from the mangled vehicle. We were saved by the rescue team of expressway.” “It was the last bus for Delhi from the Alambagh depot in Lucknow. All seats were occupied. I was sleeping at the time of the accident when I heard a loud thud. When I opened my eyes next, I found myself in hospital,” said another passenger Sham Ahmad, 28, from Amethi. Two boys who were running along the road in preparation for recruitment in the armed forces told reporters that they saw the bus fall and rushed to join the rescue. Nihal Singh, who was in a field answering the call of nature, added that he was the first to see the accident. Other villagers, too, joined in to do whatever possible, losing no time to help save those injured. The victims were quickly taken to hospitals. However, the operation to pull out the bus, whose roof had ripped off as it fell, from the drain, took several hours. Two excavators and a crane were deployed. Expressing grief over the tragedy, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of the passengers killed in the accident. He also ordered that an investigating committee, comprising the transport commissioner, divisional commissioner and IG (Agra range), be set up to probe the accident and submit it report to the state government. On his instructions, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma and state transport minister Swatantra Dev Singh rushed to Agra and met the injured in hospitals. Deputy CM Sharma said, “It's an unfortunate accident. The medical expenses of all the victims will be borne by the state government. The transport commissioner, divisional commissioner and IG (Agra range) will submit a detailed report of the bus accident to UP government to ascertain the cause of accident.” "

Principal secretary, transport, Aradhana Shukla, said, “The driver had come for night duty and was scheduled to drive a bus to Ghazipur, but there were not enough passengers on the route. So, he was told to go to Delhi. This is a routine reshuffle.” The driver, who also died in the accident, had joined UPSRTC in 2005. He was transferred to Awadh depot (Lucknow region) two years ago. Since January, he had driven buses for over 23,000 km. Also, he resumed duty after three-day rest, said sources. “His eyesight was good and he had no health issues. We are investigating if he had consumed alcohol,” said an UPSRTC official. Based on survivors’ account, the driver dozed off before the tragedy. “The accident site is hardly 5km ahead of the toll plaza and it was just a 5-minute drive from the plaza. How the driver could have suddenly dozed off is tough to imagine,” said the official. The accident’s impact can be gauged from the fact that the two front wheels came off on the expressway and the chassis and body fell into the gorge.The bus was comparatively new as it was inducted into the fleet in 2017. It was thoroughly checked and maintained before the journey. The driver had no history of accidents and operated the same bus on several occasions. "
Ghaziabad,"PM scheme flats: GDA to ask govt for Rs 2,000 crore","GHAZIABAD: A target set by the UP government to build 36,000 flats under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) by 2021 will require the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) to spend at least Rs 2,400 crore, which the development agency says is “very difficult” given the paucity of funds it is facing. “The cost of each flat under the PM scheme is Rs 4.5 lakh, of which the Centre will contribute Rs 1.5 lakh, UP government Rs 1 lakh and the remaining amount will have to be borne by the beneficiary. But we have seen that the actual cost of building one house comes to around Rs 15 lakh, which includes cost of construction and the land. This raises the difference amount for the GDA,” said a senior official at the development agency. He added that the GDA would need 60 acres for constructing the flats. “By a rough estimate, the GDA will have to bear Rs 2,400 from its kitty to meet the target of building 36,000 flats under PMAY. This looks very difficult, given the financial health that the development agency is in. We desperately need financial help from the state government,” he added. The UP government wants the GDA to use its infrastructure fund and the share that it gets from the sale of properties to build the houses. “The funds collected from these sources are meant for GDA’s own projects. If they are used for PMAY, we will be left with little or no money for other projects,” the official said. “We will raise these concerns with the state government in a meeting later and will seek funds from them for PMAY. We can also rely on private developers for taking up more construction of flats,” he added. According to the break-up, the target set for the GDA is 13,500 affordable houses in 2018-19; 18,000 units in 2019-20 and 4,500 more for 2020-21. So far, no flats under PMAY have been completed. The places where the GDA is planning to construct affordable houses are Koyal Enclave, where 1,800 units will come up. In Pratap Vihar, the target is 1,910 units; 1,441 in Masuri; 528 in Newari; 532 in Dasna; and 856 in Maduban-Bapudham. "
Ghaziabad,Robbers in masks target soft drinks godown,"GHAZIABAD: Three masked men barged into a godown of soft drinks in Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar area on Sunday night and allegedly fled with Rs 4.25 lakh cash and six mobile phones after holding seven people, including the owner, hostage at gunpoint. The owner of the godown, Sanjeev Chaudhary, was present inside along with his cousin Rajiv Chaudhary, a customer and a few staff members when the miscreants barged in at 8.10pm. The godown is located in Vijay Nagar’s South Side E block. Police said when Sanjeev tried to resist the robbery, the miscreants even hit him with the butt of a gun that they were carrying. Later, they locked him up along with other people inside the godown while they were fleeing the spot. Sanjeev told police that as they had hidden two mobile phones, which the robbers could not spot, they managed to call the police control room and get help. “They took Rs 3.5 lakh cash that was kept inside the counter and Rs 65,000 from the customer that was present with us,” Sanjeev told police. On the basis of the complaint, an FIR was registered against the three unknown persons under Section 394 (robbery) of the IPC at Vijay Nagar police station on Monday. "
Ghaziabad,Rainwater harvesting in Ghaziabad societies to be checked,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) will soon carry out on-spot inspections in all group housing societies, industrial and institutional units in the city to ascertain the level of compliance regarding rainwater harvesting and tree plantations. It is mandatory for developers and RWAs to adhere to clauses in the building by-laws related to rainwater harvesting and compulsory plantation. Non-adherence to them may elicit punitive measures from GDA. “From 2012 till now, the GDA has issued completion certificates to 798 housing societies and others in which it had been made mandatory to install rainwater harvesting measures, ahead of monsoon and in view of critical ground water table in the city we will carry out on spot verification to find out level of adherence,” said Kanchan Verma, vice chairperson, GDA. GDA’s enforcement wing has also been asked to check adherence to tree plantation clauses. “Depending on the plot area of group housing societies, industrial and institutional units in the city, there is a set of rules that includes compulsory planation,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner, GDA. According to building by-laws, in a plot area up to 200 sq m, plantation of two trees at a distance of 10 metres is compulsory. “In Industrial areas located in polluted zones, 15% of their total area should be densely planted and up to 1 hectares, it is mandatory to plant 125 trees,” added Shivpuri. “In group housing societies, a tree per 2.5 persons needs to be planted in societies’ open and green areas,” added Shivpuri. Even though there is a well-defined law on rainwater harvesting and compulsory plantation, environmentalists point out to large scale violation of the law. “You will hardly find any society that has really adhered to the mandatory plantation clause,” said Ruchin Mehra, a city based environmentalist.

Ghaziabad,18-year-old dies as scooter hits truck on Hindon flyover,"GHAZIABAD: An 18-year-old boy died after he rammed his scooter into a stationary tractor trolley on Hindon Elevated road on Monday afternoon, police said. The victim, coming from a wholesale chicken market in Delhi's Gazipur, was headed home in Masuri’s Nahal village when he met with the accident at 1.30 pm, they said. Onlookers said the boy was speeding and could not see the parked vehicle. The impact of the collision was such that the boy, Faizan, smashed his head although he was wearing a locally-made helmet. The accident area is under Sahibabad police station’s jurisdiction, the cops said. Arun, the tractor owner, informed that he was going home in Nandgram after buying fodder but the vehicle broke down on the road. “While awaiting help, I heard a loud bang. I saw the accident. The boy apparently died on the spot,"" he said. Soon after the mishap, a huge crowd gathered around the spot and the police control room (PCR) was called. By the time police reached the spot, a trail of vehicles had formed on Delhi to Ghaziabad side of the elevated road. Altogether, traffic remained disrupted on the road for about 40 minutes. The body was sent for post-mortem and the family of the deceased was informed about the mishap. The police said that an FIR would be registered in the case. Since the road’s opening in March last year, several fatal accidents have taken place and speeding has been found to be one of the major reasons for such mishaps. "
Lucknow,Driver dozed off or went to max speed in 5 mins?,"LUCKNOW: The Janrath bus that crashed into a divider on the Yamuna Expressway and plunged into a drain early Monday was fitted with a speed-limiting device that allows maximum acceleration of 80 kmph. But if a 60-tonne bus picks up maximum speed in a five-minute span, it could spin out of control. Senior UPSRTC officials who are probing the accident say this is what could have happened as the expressway parapet had tyre marks. ""The bus first jumped onto the parapet, hit an iron rod below and then plunged into the gorge,"" said a senior official.  The driver, Kripashankar Chaudhary, was not familiar with the route and finally came on track after passengers pointed out that he was on wrong course, said sources. He was engaged for the trip to accommodate a huge rush of examinees who came to Lucknow earlier in the day, said senior UPSRTC officials.

Lucknow,Why roads share blame for India’s deadly bus accidents,"NEW DELHI: June 21, 2019: 44 people die as a bus skids off the road in Kullu while navigating a sharp bend. There were no crash barriers at the site and the road was in a bad condition.July 1, 2018: An overloaded private bus going from Pauri to Nainital in Uttarakhand falls into a gorge, killing 48. A few of the wounded later said the driver was trying to avoid a massive pothole on the road when he lost control of the vehicle.January 19, 2017: A bus packed with little kids on their way to school in Etah hits a truck, leaving 18 schoolchildren dead. It takes days for some of the survivors to recover from the trauma and get back to class.Accidents on Indian roads that kill thousands of passengers have been occurring with alarming regularity. Sample these numbers: Over 11,000 people have died in bus accidents every year in the country, according to official data from 2015 to 2017. In 2017, UP alone recorded 1,406 such deaths while 1,684 perished in the state in accidents involving buses in 2018. Many of these occurred on the “super fast” Yamuna Expressway — Delhi’s seamless link to Agra — and the site of Monday’s deadly incident in which a UPSRTC bus cruising at about 100 kmph dived into a drain. In fact, the killer stretch has recorded 5,507 road accidents and 944 deaths since it opened to traffic in August 2012. In most cases, it is easy to blame the driver. He is, after all, the one behind the wheel. But could the road itself be a problem? Or enforcement of rules? Yes, say experts. The primary focus of accident causation has been narrowing down on unsafe driver behaviour — speeding, fatigue and alcohol use. As a standard measure, police file an FIR against the driver, and the “investigation” often ends there. But the issue with this approach is that it doesn’t take into account several factors that contribute to crashes, road geometrics being one. People gather at the site where officials take out the bus from a drain after it met with an accident and claimed 29 lives at Yamuna Expressway in Agra on July 8, 2019. (ANI Photo)In 2018, the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE), a non-profit, conducted a probe into a bus accident in Kangra (Himachal Pradesh) where 24 children had died and found that the driver was not the only one to blame. “He was guilty of wrongful driving but the road environment — which includes road engineering and signage — did not meet required standards for safe operation,” road safety expert Rohit Baluja, who headed the investigation, told TOI. A probe by the state police into a bus accident that killed 60 in Kondagattu in Telengana in 2018 came up with similar findings. Krishna Prasad T, Telangana’s DGP in charge of road safety, said, “The primary reason was overloading. But we also found that the gradient of the road was too steep and there were chances that brakes wouldn’t work. There were poorly designed speedbreakers that could contribute to the driver losing control.” The engineering defects of this stretch have since been corrected, he said. Baluja added that instead of focusing completely on driver behaviour, it is faulty roads that need to be repaired. “Take hilly roads, for example. There are too many sharp bends. Potholes and boulders cover half the road but are not removed in time. Traffic control devices such as signage are usually missing and there is absolutely no enforcement of speed. We don’t investigate crashes and fix responsibility.” Prasanna Patwardhan, CMD of Purple Buses, which has a fleet of over 3,000, said, “I fail to understand why accident-prone spots have only warning signage year after year when the actual need is to fix them.” Seven students injured after a schools bus rolled down a hill in Lower Khalini area of Shimla on July 1, 2019. Locals are rescuing the students. (ANI Photo)Policy-makers remain tight-lipped on much needed reforms. Experts have been demanding mandatory scientific investigation of fatal accidents like those in Germany, UK and the US. While section 135 of the Motor Vehicles Act talks about the need to frame a mechanism for investigation of accident cases, most states have no such system in place. Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has admitted that causes of road accidents could range from faulty engineering of vehicles and roads to drunk driving and people obtaining driving licence without being properly trained. In 2018, the government had announced Rs 11,000 crore to fix black spots —places where most accidents occur — across the country. But this is unlikely to be enough. India — a signatory to the Brasilia Declaration, has pledged to cut road accidents and fatalities by half by 2020 — will need major reforms to achieve its target. Fatigue management could be a good start. So is getting rid of incentives and market pressures that encourage drivers to get behind the wheel while exhausted. In some cases, drivers do with as little as four hours of sleep. The law doesn’t make it mandatory to have a reserve driver in buses. Major (retired) Manish Singh, incharge coordinator of Yamuna Expressway, one of the deadliest stretches in India, said drivers dozing was a recurring factor. The driver involved in Monday’s accident is also suspected to have fallen asleep at the wheel. “In a previous accident case, we found that the actual driver was resting due to exhaustion while another person had been driving the bus -- at full speed.” Lucknow UPSRTC regional manager P K Bose said that the corporation has taken measures to fight fatigue in drivers such as distributing thermos to them so that they could sip tea and stay alert. “We have also provided two drivers on buses operating on long routes,” he added.

Lucknow,"Journey home turns tragic for Ghaziabad couple, Noida clerk","GHAZIABAD: An elderly couple from Ghaziabad and a UPSRTC clerk returning to Noida after meeting his family were among the passengers of the ill-fated Jan Rath bus that met with an accident in Agra early on Monday. While 65-year-old Satya Prakash Sharma from Chiranjiv Vihar in Ghaziabad died on the spot, his 57-year-old wife Manju survived. Neighbours said the Sharmas had left Ghaziabad four days ago and were returning from Lucknow on Monday when the bus fell into a drain on Yamuna Expressway near Agra's Etmadpur. Manju suffered fractures on her legs, besides injuries on the head and back. Satya Prakash had retired from the marketing department of a liquor company a few years ago but was still associated with it. Rajnish Srivastav, the Sharmas' tenant, said, ""Uncle (Satya) was quite good at his job, so the company had been still using his services. For this, he would frequently go to various towns on official tours. However, this time around, the aunt (Manju) also went with him."" He added that they had planned to visit Varanasi as well during the trip. The couple's two sons, Ranjan and Khushal, rushed to Agra after the accident. While Ranjan, who is a business analyst with a Noida-based firm, lives with the couple, Khushal lives with his family in Noida. At least 29 people were killed and 23 others injured when a passenger bus fell into a drain on the Yamuna Expressway on Monday morning. Initial probe revealed that the mishap occurred after the driver of the bus, which was travelling from Lucknow to Delhi, dozed off at the wheel.

Lucknow,Super 30’s recognition can help me open a school in UP: Anand Kumar,"One of modern India’s most-talked-about teachers, Anand Kumar was in the city on Monday to promote the film based on his life. We caught up with teacher-mentor at a local school post his interaction with the students there. In his interaction with LT, Kumar talked about his feelings on the release of his biopic and how this Lucknow visit is special for him. Having been to Lucknow several times in the past, the educationist felt this visit was special for him. He shared, ""I have been to Lucknow many times before to select students, aur yahan baar-baar aana acchha lagta hai. But this time it is special because I recently got the news that Lucknow is among the two cities with maximum advance bookings for our film. So, I feel very happy and connected to the city this time."" Anand feels happy that Hrithik Roshan is reprising his character in the film Super 30 (BCCL) Anand feels happy that Hrithik Roshan is reprising his character in the film Super 30 (BCCL) Ask the Patna-based mathematician how does it feel when his biopic 'Super 30' is going to be shown on the silver screen and he was quick to respond, ""It feels very good! Earlier, when we used to come to Lucknow to screen students for our coaching, we used to do a conference at Sharma ki chai ki dukaan. And now today we are sitting at a prominent school in the city. No doubt your popularity increases and people start recognizing you. But the best thing is that you also start getting association of more and more people who want to carry forward your vision and do good work for the underprivileged students. And gradually our reach is going to expand."" He further added, ""I had wanted to open a school in UP. In fact, I had submitted the whole plan to the concerned officials, but the government changed in the meanwhile and things couldn’t materialise. Now, I am hoping that the film’s recognition would help me to open a school in UP. If the Uttar Pradesh government gives its support, I would like to open the school in Noida, because it is centrally located and more and more students can reach there from around the country. The admission in the school will not be on the basis of merit and not on religion, caste or class."" Anand Kumar gave some tips to the students at the school on how to crack difficult math equations (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Anand Kumar gave some tips to the students at the school on how to crack difficult math equations (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Anand is also elated that Hrithik Roshan is playing his character on screen. ""People would say he looks like a Britisher or a Greek God and you look like a villager. But he has encapsulated my character on screen perfectly. The amount of curiosity Hrithik showed in the film earlier and later the amount of hard work he put in for the film, I think he was the right choice for the film. For one whole year he kept preparing for the role. I mean, his dedication was so much that he first gave up gyming to fit into the character. He used to copy my Bihari-Hindi accent. He used to make my videos and then would watch it over and over again for the dialect and mannerism. Just like me, once when our meeting got over, he forgot to wear his slippers as he came down of this flat to see me off,"" said Kumar, while talking about his ‘hero’.  Earlier in the day, while interacting with the students, Anand Kumar gave them a glimpse into his past and the passion with which he has helped shape the future of several students. ""A proper strategy, planned preparation and a skilled team can deliver astonishing results. This is the formula which has worked for me and it applies equally to everyone. Today, the world is looking at us with hopeful eyes, which not only augurs well for the country but for the world. We need to make India stronger. If we can contribute even the slightest bit in realizing this dream, we would have made our life and education meaningful,"" he said. He also motivated students for a brighter future, ""As you step into the professional world after studies, you must remember that the potential for learning is never exhausted. Education is a life-long process, I hope that your studies would have inspired you to seek knowledge at every stage in your careers,"" he added. "

Kanpur,CBI conducts raids at 110 locations in 19 states,"NEW DELHI: In yet another mammoth operation, the CBI conducted raids at 110 locations in 19 states and Union Territories as part of its investigations into 33 cases which the agency registered recently. The cases concern offences of corruption, arms smuggling and criminal misconduct, officials said. This was the second large operation in a week. Last Tuesday, the CBI had carried out countrywide raids against alleged loan defaulters after several banks registered FIRs with the agency. Searches were conducted in Lucknow and some places in the NCR in connection with the sugar mills disinvestment scam which allegedly took place during Mayawati's tenure as Uttar Pradesh chief minister. The agency searched the premises of former IAS officers Netram and Vinay Priya Dhune and sons of former MLC Iqbal Singh — Wajid Ali and Mohammed Javed — in this case. Netram was Mayawati’s secretary at the time. The CBI had registered an FIR and six preliminary enquiries in this case in April. Another FIR was lodged against former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and searches were conducted at the office of Krrish Builders in Jasola in south-east Delhi in this case. In Kanpur, the CBI searched the premises of K A Duggal, the then CMD of BICL, and company secretary K V Vajpayee in a case of alleged irregularities in the tendering process during the sale of BICL properties. Searches were also conducted in the case of a missing youth from Rajasthan and disbursal of 13 housing loans worth Rs 3 crore by an SBI branch manager in Haridwar. Another raid was in connection with a cheating case where a Mumbai-based businessman, Ramesh Chaurasaia, was sold 980 acres of land for Rs 11.5 crore in Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh on the basis of forged government seals and stamp papers.

Lucknow,Mumbai touts hoarding tatkal tickets of city,"LUCKNOW: The RPF may have nabbed 40 railway touts over the past month, but bonafide passengers are still unable to book tatkal tickets from Lucknow. Many have alleged that the tickets are vanishing within minutes of the online and offline tatkal windows opening. For instance, on Tuesday, the tatkal quota lapsed in three minutes flat. Raman Mishra, who came to Charbagh early to book a ticket for Gorakhpur and was only second in queue, was shocked when he got a tatkal ticket that was 12 on the waiting list. Rishikesh Saxena, a resident of New Hyderabad, had logged on to the railway website at 10am sharp to book a Wednesday ticket to Mumbai. All he got was 10th position on the waiting list. RPF officers blamed touts in Mumbai, Pune and Delhi who had associates in Lucknow. “Touts there are buying tatkal tickets in bulk and sending them by air or road to Lucknow, where it is sold at a premium. For example, Lucknow-Mumbai confirmed tickets have an additional price tag of Rs 1,000 for AC-II, Rs 600 for AC-II and Rs 300 for sleeper coach,” said an officer. Two touts arrested recently from Lucknow and one from Gonda, along with 111 confirmed tatkal tickets, had confessed to their links in other cities. “They said tickets were booked on their behalf by their aides in Mumbai. Orders are placed through texts,” said senior divisional security commissioner, North Eastern Railway, Amit Prakash Mishra. "

Kanpur,Centre will fund 28 cities with million plus population Rs 10 crore each to clean up air,"NEW DELHI: Extending initial financial support to cities under its National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), the Centre has started funding 102 cities with 28 cities with million plus population among them, including Mumbai, Kanpur, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Varanasi, Bengaluru, Kolkara, Hyderabad and Patna, getting Rs 10 crore each for capacity building activities. “Eighty of these 102 non-attainment cities have already prepared their city-centric action plans. The Centre is funding them so that these identified cities can take pollution abatement measures on the ground,” said Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar. Overall cost of air pollution abatement measures in 102 cities will, however, be much more than what the Centre will provide. An official explained that such financial assistance is in addition to what are being done, worth thousands of crores of rupees, in different sectors (transport, highways, forests and renewable among others) across the country to reduce carbon emission. The non-attainment cities, listed for multiple actions under NCAP, are those which did not meet the ambient air quality standard during 2011-15. The 28 million plus cities, identified for funding of higher amount, are those which had reported high pollution level - more than 90 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) of PM10 (particulate matter). The other cities in this group include Raipur, Vijaywada, Surat, Bhopal, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Bhubaneswar, Agra, Allahabad, Nagpur and Pune among others. Among remaining 74 non-attainment cities, the ones having population of 5 to 10 lakhs will get Rs 20 lakh each while the cities with population of less than 5 lakh will get Rs 10 lakh each as an initial amount. “This financial year, the ministry has got an additional amount of Rs 460 crore with introduction of a separate head - Control of Pollution - under the budget,” said Javadekar while sharing budgetary provisions of his ministry in 2019-20. He noted that the ministry was allocated Rs 3,175 crore for 2019-20 as compared to Rs 2,683 crore in last fiscal - an increase of 16%. Javadekar said, “The budget 2019-20 has declared the intention of making ‘Earth Green and Sky Blue’. This will be achieved through more afforestation and making cities pollution free”. The Centre had launched the pan-India air pollution abatement scheme for 102 cities by formally unveiling details of its pollution reduction target and strategies in January. It had set a mid-term (five-year) target to reduce air pollution by 20-30% by 2024, taking 2017 as base year. The ‘control of pollution’ has been conceptualised to provide financial assistance to pollution control boards, funding to NCAP and other schemes such as National Water Monitoring Programme and National Ambient Noise Monitoring Network among others. Besides building capacities for air pollution abatement measures, the cities will also use the fund for source apportionment study, tree plantation, procuring water sprinklers and mechanical street sweepers, creating construction and demolition waste management facilities and public awareness.

Ghaziabad,Delhi’s Gone Girl: Woman stages suicide to get husband arrested,"GHAZIABAD: “Have you arrested my husband?” When police finally got to the woman curled up under a blanket in a two-tier AC coach of Coimbatore Express at Bangalore City railway station late on July 8 (Monday), this was her only question. “Tell me, has my husband been sent to jail?” Komal Talan, the woman on the Bengaluru train, was 22 when Gillian Flynn’s page-turner, Gone Girl, first arrived at bookstores, and 24 when it was released, two years later, as one of the most anticipated movies of 2014. At 29, she could say she owns the title. Komal, a trainee manager with an insurance company on Barakhamba Road, disappeared on July 5 from her in-laws’ house in Delhi’s Pandav Nagar. A day later, her white Scorpio was found parked under the Hindon elevated road in Ghaziabad with a note saying she was “going away”, and accusing her husband and in-laws of torturing her over dowry since her wedding on April 20, 2018. The note and the car, parked right next to the Hindon canal, suggested she had committed suicide. Fake ID, new number and 4 cities: Cops finally bring back ‘Gone Girl’Divers were called to look for a body. Later, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) scoured the length of the canal, whose waters are still and mostly shallow. But this wasn’t the presumed last cry of anguish from a woman driven to despair. It actually was the final piece in months of planning by a woman who had channelled all her rage into quietly planning revenge against her husband for all the torture he had allegedly inflicted, a plot line straight from the pages of Flynn’s novel. For the first 24 hours of her disappearance, as divers searched the canal and police briefed news reporters on a possible suicide, the plot proceeded exactly as Komal had laid out. Her father, a Bharatiya Kisan Union member, filed a police complaint and a case was registered against her husband Abhishek Chaudhary, a bank executive, and her in-laws, at Indirapuram police station on Saturday night. They were charged with domestic violence and kidnapping under provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Police also detained Abhishek for questioning as Komal’s parents accused him of murdering her and throwing her body into the canal. This was the second FIR filed in two days — the first was a missing person’s complaint filed at Barakhamba Road police station on July 5, the same night she disappeared. Just as Komal had thought it would be: it did look like she had driven all the way to Hindon Canal from Pandav Nagar in east Delhi, and jumped. She had left home for office in the morning and never returned — her last location was Sahibabad, 6.45pm — and her SUV wasn’t found till the next morning. It gave Komal time. She switched off her phone, went to Anand Vihar, and took an overnight bus to Jaipur. From there, she bought air tickets for Mumbai. She used the name Kamakshi, an identity she had created through forged documents and a possibly forged Aadhaar card (still being probed). Her note, which she left in the SUV, had been discovered by then. And while divers looked for her body in the Ghaziabad canal on July 7, Komal sat back in the economy class of an airplane that cruised towards India’s west coast. On landing in Mumbai, Komal checked into a hotel and booked a berth, again as Kamakshi, on Coimbatore Express. She boarded the train from Kurla that night. She had no particular destination. All she wanted to do was stay away long enough for Abhishek to go to jail. But her plan was eventually blown by electronic surveillance. Komal, police said, was in touch with some friends using a different number. That’s how she was eventually tracked. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said, “She had deliberately parked her car near the canal so that police and her family assumed she had committed suicide. Her motive was to see her husband behind bars. She remained on the move to avoid detection and did not speak to her parents either. She also hid her real identity to buy tickets.” Kumar said police got an inkling of Komal’s plan when they spoke to some of her close friends. They soon discovered the number she was using and her new identity, Kamakshi. Investigators also found she had withdrawn her entire July salary, probably to fund her getaway. “She would have returned home after all the money she was carrying was exhausted,” said a police officer who was part of the investigation. A police team was formed to find her. It missed her train narrowly in Pune and eventually tasted success at Bangalore. A cousin of Komal accompanied the police team to identify her. Komal’s father Anil Talan claimed he had given Rs 41 lakh in cash and an Audi car as dowry to Abhishek, whose father Dharmendra Kumar is a sub-inspector in Delhi Police. Talan also alleged Abhishek’s family was demanding another Rs 21 lakh for starting a business for him. The Talans are based in Greater Noida. “We had not spoken to Komal on Friday and on Saturday evening. Dharmendra called me and informed me about the car being parked near Hindon canal and that Komal was nowhere to be found,” the FIR lodged by Anil Talan read. Talking to reporters after being brought to Ghaziabad on Tuesday, Komal alleged her fatherin-law abused her from the first day of marriage and would tell her he was the boss of the house and she couldn’t do anything without his permission. Asked about her getaway, she said, “I did not think much while leaving from here (Hindon canal). I did not know my destination. I did whatever came to my mind. The only thing which was clear was that I would never go back to my husband’s house. Even if my family asked me to go back for the sake of their social status, I would have not listened to them.” Police said charges of kidnapping would be removed from the FIR against Komal’s husband but the other sections would remain. Abhishek was arrested on Tuesday night, after Komal’s return, and will be produced before a magistrate on Wednesday. In that, her plan to see her husband behind bars has worked. "
Kanpur,"With robot hands, IIT-K profs bring joy to paralytics","KANPUR: Taking calibrated steps inside the centre for mechatronics at IIT-Kanpur, professors Ashish Dutta and KS Venkatesh can hardly contain their excitement on Chandrayaan-2 launch mission scheduled for July 15. The six-wheeled robot, Pragyan, that will land on lunar surface after it’s sent aboard GSLV-MKIII by Isro from Sriharikota, has two subsystems — structured light-based map generation and motion planning — built by the IIT-K duo. But, the two professors have another reason for delight: they have ventured into world’s first robot exoskeleton hand for rehabilitation of stroke patients and finished its trials. Their latest device is a two-finger robotic hand (exoskeleton) that uses four bar mechanism and has four degrees of freedom (DOF). The exoskeleton can be worn by a patient on his hand. It uses brain signals, with the help of brain computer interface (BCI) worn on head, and helps paralytic patients open and close the motion of their thumb, index and middle fingers for physical practice. The exoskeleton is driven by AtMEGA 300 Mhz micro-controller and powered by a battery. The professors say that the device will cost around Rs 15,000. “It’s a proud moment and double joy for us while we recall the algorithm, which we made for lunar mission Chandrayaan to help the rover move safely between one point and another, known as path planning or motion. The structured light is like a scanning laser that will survey the surface of the moon, will take pictures and generate 3D maps and path planning. This will ensure four aspects — take minimum energy (20-50 watts) on 10 MHz processor, safe route, prevent rover from toppling over and finally, avoid obstacles in its route. Now, our next mission is completing large-scale clinical trials of exoskeleton in India and the UK,” said Dutta, who is coordinator of Centre for Mechantronics. For exoskeleton, the duo has teamed up with UK-based Ulster University and its professor Girijesh Prasad, who belongs to Gorakhpur. The device has sensors, which monitor the fingertip pressure applied by the patient. If the patient is able to close or move his finger, the device passively follows the motion. If he does not, then the device actively forces the finger to close, while taking directions from BCI using EEG signals. As far as design of the device is concerned, the exoskeleton’s degrees of freedom movement is based on human finger motion while manipulating a coin in hands. The joints on the device consist of four bars to give a human motion. The design and development of an exoskeleton robot for human hand support and rehabilitation is a Rs 55-lakh MHRD project, sanctioned in 2018, led by its department of science and technology and British Council in the UK. The research has been published in leading journals, including Journal of Neuroscience Methods, Biomedical and Health Informatics, Haptics and Engineering in Medical and Biology Society. "
Lucknow,WhatsApp honeytrap behind shooting near Charbagh station,"LUCKNOW: An engineering graduate from Bihar who was promised a railway contract worth crores in that state worked in sync with two women to honeytrap a history-sheeter over WhatsApp and target the latter near Lucknow Junction on July 2, GRP officers said on Tuesday. Gorakh, alias Virendra Thakur, sustained two bullet wounds in the Narkatiyaganj firing and is recuperating at a Delhi hospital. The student in his 20s, a native of Bettiah district in Bihar, is on the run. The two women were nabbed in Kolkata and are being brought to Lucknow via train. ""Prima facie, it appears that the July 2 shooter is a diploma-holder in engineering and was promised a contract in Bettiah. Thakur had also applied for the tender worth several crores. We have succeeded in identifying the women who honey-trapped Thakur. The exact sequence of events will be known once these women are brought to Lucknow,"" said SP, GRP Lucknow, Saumitra Yadav Sources privy to the probe told TOI that Thakur had a criminal past. He is named in as many as 25 cases, including loot, kidnapping and attempted murder. He has been convicted in a few other cases. ""For a long time, Thakur was on the hit list of his rival gang. It is a war of supremacy. The gang roped in two women to honey-trap him over WhatsApp. On the other hand, the engineering graduate was also fielded,"" a source said. A day before the assault, the women convinced Thakur to meet them at a hotel. The man was smart enough to not fall for the bait and changed the meeting venue first to Charbagh Metro and later near Lucknow Junction, where he was attacked. SP Yadav claimed they had almost cracked the case. ""We need to grill the women for more details on their accomplices,"" he said. On July 2, Thakur was shot twice - once on the waist and then on the leg. He had remained tight-lipped on why he was attacked. Later, cops quizzed his wife in Neelmath and got a lead. It turned out that Thakur had received a call from someone while he was going to the bank with his wife. He dropped her at the bank and left for the station, saying he will pick her up in a couple of hours. His phone records helped police trace the women in Bengal. "
Lucknow,"Seven lions for Uttar Pradesh, with love from Gujarat","LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is preparing to greet seven lions from Gujarat, instead of eight initially planned, at Etawah Safari Park and chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s showpiece Gorakhpur zoo. A team of two vets that visited Junagarh zoo and thoroughly examined the big cats found one female to be suffering from neurological issues. The others, including two males, have received a medical clean chit and their health certificates have reached the state government. “We are expecting seven lions, five of them females, from Junagarh zoo very soon,” said director of Etawah safari VK Singh. The extra precaution of getting the lions medically examined in their parent state before bringing them to UP stemmed from the embarrassment the erstwhile Akhilesh Yadav government had faced after five out of the 10 lions brought from Gujarat between 2013 and 2015 under an animal exchange programme died between 2014 and 2016. The big cats had contracted the canine distemper virus, which attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems in domestic and wild animals. This time, the big cats from Junagarh are a gift from the Vijay Rupani government, which passed on their custody to UP on June 11. The safari has since been sanitised against the contagion, courtesy a vaccine provided by San Diego zoo, US. The big cats were initially set to reach Etawah by May 22, but the blistering heat forced the forest department to postpone the plan. The decision for medical check-up further delayed their arrival. Now, the lions are likely to reach UP by the end of July. Four safari keepers have been to Junagarh zoo twice to spend time with the lions to understand their behaviour, habits and needs. The lions will be quarantined for 21 days at the safari before being shifted to their new home, the Gorakhpur zoo, which is likely be ready for them only by November. The fact that the zoo can house only three lions indicates that the rest may stay back in Etawah. "

Mannya Tiwari, from Kanpur, was reportedly reeling under stress due to ongoing semester examinations. According to college authorities, she called up her mother around 5.30am and said that her previous exam had gone badly. Her mother consoled her saying she could reappear for it. Mannya reportedly replied that she would not take the exam again and was going to jump from the building and disconnected the phone. Her mother immediately alerted the hostel warden, who along with a guard rushed to save Mannya. However, by that time, she had jumped from the building.  By afternoon, her parents arrived in college and informed the authorities about the phone call. Her father Ashish Tiwari, a professor at IIT-Kanpur, said that Mannya was their only child and was a brilliant student. She had cleared both medical and IIT entrance exams in the first attempt but had opted for medical. Dr NS Senger, former principal of the medical college, said the incident was shocking and that Mannya was a promising student. "
Lucknow,Selfie is the new sign-in for teachers in UP,"LUCKNOW: The selfie obsession may have triggered a debate on whether the social media fad is a bane or a boon, but it’s turned out to be a clinical tool to enforce discipline in education in the Uttar Pradesh hinterland. District education authorities in Barabanki, UP have hit upon an innovative idea to smash the network of ghost teachers and rampant absenteeism in class with a diktat to its 7,500 teachers — send your selfie before starting class or lose a day’s salary. Besides the selfie-attendance meter, other disciplinary measures have been enforced. Teachers found surfing social media sites during school hours will also lose pay. The new mechanism to ensure punctuality has triggered panic. Teachers, particularly women, are now hurriedly completing morning chores, catching public transport to rush to school. And their first job is to shoot a selfie before their classroom and post it on the Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) webpage to mark their attendance. Their mission needs to be completed by 8am sharp with BSA putting in place an automated system to verify selfies. So far, 700 teachers have lost pay in two months after the system was implemented and schools reopened after summer vacation in Barabanki. Primary education had been crippled in the state due to chronic absenteeism by teachers in primary and upper primary schools and ghost teachers on pay rolls. Education department officials have caught several primary teachers not taking classes in remote areas and hiring a local man to teach on their behalf for cut money. Also, some unscrupulous teachers don’t report to schools at all and manage their attendance and pocket their salaries in connivance with clerical staff. Talking to TOI, basic shiksha adhikari V P Singh said, the entire process of receiving and verifying selfies is being strictly implemented on directions of the chief minister and basic education minister. “Teachers have been specifically told if they don’t post their selfies by 8 am, they would lose their a day’s pay,” said Singh. But teachers feel the diktat is “tortuous”. “Traffic jams, unavailability of public transport in rural areas and poor Internet connectivity are posing a hurdle in uploading selfies on time. I lost a day’s salary because my tempo got stuck in a jam at the railway crossing,” said a woman teacher of a primary school in Ram Nagar in Barabanki district. One of her colleagues said, “District authorities are not ready to accept that Internet on mobiles fluctuate and this delays uploading of selfies. Net speed is so slow in rural areas and sometimes selfies can’t be posted at all. And we end up losing a day’s pay.” Talking to TOI, Barabanki’s basic shiksha adhikari VP Singh, said there’s enough buffer time to teachers, but selfies have to be posted by 8am. Also, teacher teachers can surf Facebook, Twitter or Whatsapp during school hours, he said. "
Kanpur,"With robot hands, IIT-Kanpur professors bring joy to paralytics","KANPUR: Taking calibrated steps inside the centre for mechatronics at IIT-Kanpur, professors Ashish Dutta and KS Venkatesh can hardly contain their excitement on Chandrayaan-2 launch mission scheduled for July 15.  The six-wheeled robot, Pragyan, that will land on lunar surface after it's sent aboard GSLV-MKIII by Isro, has two subsystems - structured light-based map generation and motion planning - built by the IIT-K duo. But, the two professors have another reason for delight: They have ventured into world's first robot exoskeleton hand for rehabilitation of stroke patients and finished its trials. Their latest device is a two-finger robotic hand (exoskeleton) that uses four bar mechanism and has four degrees of freedom (DOF). The exoskeleton can be worn by a patient on his hand. It uses brain signals, with the help of brain computer interface (BCI) worn on head, and helps paralytic patients open and close the motion of their thumb, index and middle fingers for physical practice. The exoskeleton is powered by a battery. The professors say that the device will cost around Rs 15,000.  ""It's a proud moment and double joy for us while we recall the algorithm, which we made for lunar mission Chandrayaan to help the rover move safely between one point and another. The structured light is like a scanning laser that will survey the surface of the moon, will take pictures and generate 3D maps and path planning. Now, our next mission is completing large-scale clinical trials of exoskeleton in India and the UK,"" said Dutta, who is coordinator of Centre for Mechantronics. For the exoskeleton, the duo has teamed up with UK-based Ulster University and its professor Girijesh Prasad, who belongs to Gorakhpur. "
Lucknow,"Bus accident graph up in Uttar Pradesh, dips in India","LUCKNOW: The frequency of bus accidents may have dipped across India in the last decade, but Uttar Pradesh is the only state where the graph has shot up, according to data by Union ministry of road transport and highways. The state also clocked a rise in fatal accidents involving government buses. The number of accidents in 2006 stood at 1,894 and in 2016, it rose to 2,853. The data of the following year showed a spurt by 100 cases. The trend can be attributed to a population boom, augmentation in fleet, rise in bus frequency and more routes getting nationalised where government buses were allowed to ply, said a UPSRTC official. ""Improved road conditions are also a reason, so is faulty road engineering. Three years ago, after a bus crashed into a crossing in Bareilly, we rectified the engineering error. The road was designed in a way that it was impossible for the driver to see what lies beyond the crossing,"" said a senior official of UP Road Safety Cell. Also, smooth roads spur speed. At least 60% bus accidents in last few years have taken place on expressways and highways. An expressway is a completely different driving experience and low traffic density makes the driver go off-guard easily as monotony sets in, said the official. ""When we analyse causes, we do it under three parameters-mechanical failure, human error and the driver on the other side who triggered it,"" said an official. Going by this clause, there couldn't be a common thread linking accidents. Drivers' associations, on the other hand, say a skewed bus-crew ratio could be the reason. Initially, the ratio was 1:8.5, which means at least eight people, including the driver and the conductor, are required to operate a bus. In the last 10 years the ratio has dipped to 1:7. On a long journey (1,000km both directions), a bus should have two drivers, but rules are bent due to staff crunch. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad murders and suicide: Woman’s lover arrested,"GHAZIABAD: A 22-year-old man, who was in a relationship with a nurse whose husband killed her following repeated quarrels over the illicit affair, was arrested on Monday. Police said Kapil Pippal, who is from Agra, was involved in a relationship with Sangeeta for the past two years. Sangeeta’s husband Pradeep, who was unemployed for over a year and had turned an alcoholic over time, had allegedly killed her with a hammer, poisoned her three daughters and committed suicide at their home in Masuri last week. In a six-page note purportedly written by Pradeep, he had mentioned Sangeeta’s affair with Kapil. “Sangeeta had met Kapil in Gaur Mall two years ago. Since then, they had been involved in this relationship. She had even helped him get a job at NDDTC. The duo would meet in a house in Govindpuram that Sangeeta had rented for Kapil,” SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said. Sangeeta, who worked as a nurse at an AIIMS centre in Ghaziabad, would even give Kapil Rs 10,000 every month. Around a year ago, she had got him shifted to their own house in New Shatabadipuram as a tenant, but Kapil had to vacate the room in two months because of opposition from Pradeep. Police said the woman was even ready to sell the house, which she had bought with a loan, to live with Kapil. This led to frequent quarrels between Pradeep and Sangeeta. According to Jadaun, Kapil had described to his interrogators the entire sequence of events. He has been booked under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC. Police said Pradeep would come home drunk and fight with his wife over her affair with Kapil. He would not sleep in the bedroom, but on a sofa in the drawing room. "
Lucknow,"CBI books ex-SP mantri, four IAS officers in mining cases","LUCKNOW: The CBI probe into the 2013-17 UP mining lease renewal controversy widened after the agency on Wednesday registered two separate cases of criminal conspiracy, forgery and corruption against four IAS officers and Gayatri Prajapati, a minister under the Samajwadi Party government. The CBI probe had begun on the directions of Allahabad high court over the irregularities in e-tendering procedures, renewal of existing leases and fresh leases during 2012-17. According to one FIR, the then UP principal secretary (geology and mining) Jiwesh Nandan, a 1985-batch IAS officer; then special secretary (geology and mining) Santosh Kumar (1995-batch IAS) and then Fatehpur district magistrate Abhay Singh (2007-batch IAS), had allegedly colluded with Prajapti to favour two businessmen by granting licence to mine land in 2014 despite several objections on pending dues and environmental clearances between 2010-12. Both businessmen — Shiv Singh and Sukhraj — belong to Fatehpur. While Shiv Singh had Rs 6.2 lakh in government dues outstanding against him following his renewal application in 2009 March and a curt reply of “not maintainable” by then Fatehpur DM in 2010, the next DM Abhay Singh allegedly overturned the decision in 2012 and granted him licence to carry on mining in 100-acre land in Korrakanak village of Fatehpur on January 10, 2014, for a three-year period, the CBI has alleged. Similarly, Abhay also allegedly overturned the February 2014 decision of the principal secretary (geology and mining) Chandra Prakash to not issue state mining lease to another businessman Sukhraj for 90-acre land in village Korakkana in Fatehpur. Abhay, allegedly, colluded with Prajapati to order renewal for a three-year period. The CBI has said that Abhay Singh also renewed Sukhraj’s second mining site in village Guruwal in Fatehpur. The CBI on Wednesday said that it has recovered Rs 45 lakh from Abhay, a charge which he denied. In the second FIR, the CBI has found that then DM Fatehpur Dr Vivek (2009-batch IAS) had allegedly renewed licences for two businessmen Phool Badan Nishad and Sharda Yadav despite objections by the Allahabad high court. While Nishad was granted licence for a 28-acre site at Kotwa in Ratanpura and 20-acre site Sabwat-Ahirwa road in Deoria, Yadav was granted a licence for 22-acre site on Kushinagar Deoria road. The CBI said that Vivek hatched a conspiracy with three other UP officials - then ADM, Deoria, Devi Sharan, mining clerk Hansraj and mining officer Vijay Maurya. "

Lucknow,"Denied security, Sitapur teen forced to leave own village","LUCKNOW: Unabated threats allegedly from the accused and also an inspector-rank officer have prompted the father of the Sitapur school gang rape survivor to shift her to an undisclosed location in the town away from their native village under Maholi thana. Four members of the family, including two children aged three and seven, who are still living in the village are allegedly being intimidated routinely so that the FIR is withdrawn while action on a plea for police security faxed to ADG (Lucknow zone) on July 8 is pending. The family has also appealed on the CM’s Jansunwai portal. Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, the father said the armed accused were roaming near their village home. “I am here with my eldest daughter for the past few days. My elderly mother, wife and two children are living in fear back in the village. The accused are armed with tamanchas (countrymade pistols). They are loitering near our home. The Maholi SHO is constantly pressuring us to reach a compromise with the accused,” he said over phone. On June 27, the 15-year-old student of a government school had lodged a complaint against a female teacher and four youths, accusing them of sedating her for two years, raping her and blackmailing her with threats of making video clips of the act viral. In his faxed petitition to the ADG, the father of the girl had sought transfer of the case outside the district and protection for his family. “ The survivor and are family are afraid to stay in their village because of threats from the accused and Maholi SHO... We urge you for better security and justice,” the plea to the ADG stated. The ADG is on leave. IG (Lucknow range) is holding additional charge.

Lucknow,"CBI, ED zeroing in on ‘scams’ in SP, BSP regimes","LUCKNOW: Law-enforcing agencies – CBI and ED — have expanded their footprints in Uttar Pradesh, with the proverbial sword dangling over many who allegedly had a role in scams in the BSP and SP governments. While the infamous National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) case during BSP regime took its toll with a minister in the Mayawati government, Babu Singh Kushwaha, still languishing in jail and a senior IAS officer, Pradip Shukla, now retired, out on bail, sources in CBI revealed that the “magnitude of embezzlement in the corruption-ridden sale of 21 sugar mills of the state government” was no less than the NRHM case.” In one of the 21 sugar mills near Bareilly, the plant machinery, mill compound spread over 400 acres was sold at a meagre price of Rs 26 crore, said a CBI officer. Over a dozen of IAS officers, who were part of disinvestment committee in the BSP government are bound to be in troubled, the CBI officer added. Perhaps, this is why, before formally raiding officers involved in the sale of the sugar mills, the CBI headquarters posted a full-fledged IPS officer in Lucknow as SP to pursue the investigations in this case. On July 10, the CBI raided two senior IAS officers along with lower rung officers to pursue its investigations. The CBI has also intensified its investigations in the mining licenses controversy that broke out in the previous Samajwadi Party government. Two IAS officers Abhay Kumar and B Chandrakala have already been booked after the CBI raids and many more of lower ranks also face probe while then mining minister of the same regime, Gayatri Prajapati, is already behind bars for over three years. In the last few days, CBI and ED have escalated inquiries into the construction of the Gomti River Front project, another project of the SP government, and seized properties of engineers involved in the project. Soon after coming to power in 2017, the Yogi government had ordered inquiry into alleged corruption in the project. The judicial committee and a high-powered committee headed by parliamentary affairs and urban development minister Suresh Khanna had nailed down half a dozen senior IAS officers for their suspicious role and on his recommendations, the Yogi government had sought CBI inquiry which is now looking into roles of those involved in it.

Lucknow,2 fires and 6 deaths: Hotels demolished 6 yrs after order,"LUCKNOW: The process to demolish SSJ International and Viraat International, the two hotels in Charbagh that caught fire last year killing six people, began on Wednesday. This comes six years after their demolition was ordered by the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) as they were constructed in a residential area. The order to demolish the buildings was passed in September 2013, but remained buried in files. Had the order been executed on time, the tragedy could have been averted. However, now the LDA has sought an explanation from the officer in charge of Charbagh to explain as to why directions to demolish the buildings were not carried out on time. TimesViewThe task and responsibility of authorities should not end merely with the demolition of the hotel buildings in the city. The state government must also ensure that the recommendations from the inquiry committees are acted upon and not buried like the 2013 order to demolish the hotels issued six years ago was. In fact, such laxity should be treated as criminal negligence as several lives and livelihoods are at stake. This action should become a precedent so that no such incident takes place in the future.The hotels were sealed after the fire on June 19, 2018. The state government had then set up a high-powered committee headed by additional director general of police, Lucknow Zone, to probe the causes of fire and fix accountability of officers and departments concerned. During the probe, the committee found that the land on which the two hotels were constructed was registered as residential in LDA records and the September 2013 order of demolition was never implemented. The committee submitted its report to the state government in August 2018, recommending action against 30 LDA engineers for laxity. The report was sent to the LDA on June 27 for action. While LDA vice-chairman is on leave, the secretary was not available for comments. Joint-secretary of the authority, Ritu Suhas, who is also the presiding officer of the LDA court, said that the order for demolishing the buildings were issued by the LDA court in September 2013 after it came to fore that the hotels were constructed on residential land. When asked why the order was not executed, she said that the executive engineer of zone-VI under whom Charbagh area comes, has been asked to explain the reasons about the delay in execution. "
Lucknow,"School van hits 3-wheeler, 2 kids hurt; driver flees","LUCKNOW: Two schoolchildren suffered injuries and six others had a narrow escape when their school van collided with a three-wheeler parked on the roadside in Para on Wednesday afternoon. The injured children were Aditya Yadav (10) and Paridhi Yadav (5). Locals informed police which took them to a nearby private hospital and informed their parents. They also informed parents of the other children who were badly shaken up and were crying. Initial investigation suggests that it was a case of negligent driving by the van driver who fled after the accident. The owner of the vehicle is also missing. Though the van had an RTO permit valid till July 27, the mandatory fire extinguisher and first-aid kit was missing, said police. Para SHO Triloki Singh said the incident occurred around 1.30pm. The three-wheeler had stopped to allow passengers to de-board when the speeding school van hit it from behind.

Along with a report on mob lynching, the panel has also submitted a draft of the Uttar Pradesh Combating Mob Lynching Bill to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Other than detailing action against perpetrators of lynching, the draft bill also recommends action against the police and administrative officials of the districts where such incidents take place. State Law Commission secretary Sapna Tripathi told TOI that the Supreme Court had passed an order in 2018, asking states and the Centre to frame rules to prevent lynching, but no state except Manipur acted on it. “We studied laws on lynching across the world and framed the draft bill which contains details of how lynching can be prevented and how to exercise authority against a mob. Punishment has been specified for the perpetrators depending on the result of the lynching, injury or death. We have also recommended fixing liability of police and district magistrate for failing in their duty to prevent mob violence,” she said, adding that hate crimes have also been included in the purview of the bill. Lynching has claimed 11 lives in UP in the past five years while 40 cases of mob attacks, including hate crimes, have been reported during the same period, said Tripathi. The commission has identified lynching by cow vigilantes as the major reason for lynching in the state. Interestingly, on Monday, CM Yogi Adityanath had issued directions to prevent lynching by cow vigilantes, asking the district administration to issue certificates to those transporting cattle to ensure that they are not mistaken as cow smugglers.

Lucknow,"Onus of error-free marksheets on parents, teachers","LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board (UPSEB) has fixed the responsibility of producing error-free marksheets and certificates of Classes X and XII on parents, teachers and principals. While issuing the timetable for exam registration, UP Board officials said parents, teachers and principals would have to countersign the application form that bear details of students. This year, heads of all the 27,365 schools in the state will start online registration of private and regular students for board exams from August 5. The information updated on the website will be used to prepare results. The move to fix accountability comes in the wake of Allahabad High Court’s recent directive to the board, asking it to issue marksheets and certificates in both English and Hindi to avoid mistakes, particularly in names. “Parents, teachers and principals will have to countersign forms that have details of students before these are uploaded. The idea is to ensure that names of students on marksheet and certificates are correctly printed. They will be responsible for any error in the name of a student or their parents/guardians,” said Neena Srivastava, secretary, UPSEB. According to the registration schedule, school principals will have to deposit the fee in the treasury by August 10. Those students who fail to adhere to the given date can deposit the same by August 16, albeit with a late fee of Rs 100. “Principals will be given 10 days from August 21 to amend spelling errors and typos. During this period, no new student will be registered,” the UPSEB secretary said, adding that the registration process would be completed by September 10 midnight. "
Lucknow,NGT confirms blood mixed water flowing into Varuna river in Kashi,"LUCKNOW: The crimson-coloured sewage flowing into the Varuna river from Varanasi’s Ardali Bazar locality is, in fact, blood of illegally slaughtered animals, a panel constituted by National Green Tribunal has found. The NGT-constituted Eastern UP Rivers and Water Reservoirs Monitoring Committee (EWP-RWRMC) had taken note of the ‘red water’ during an inspection in January this year. It was accompanied by members of the CPCB, UPPCB and the Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC). In its report on the pollution of city’s Varuna and Assi rivers, submitted to the NGT on Wednesday, the EUP-RWRMC observed that the major and minor drains from Ardali Bazar carry “slaughterhouse untreated effluent” and domestic sewage into the Varuna, and eventually into the Ganga. It states that reports by various scientists have confirmed that the Varuna’s water quality is “poor” and oxygen levels of the river downstream are “below detectable limits”. Owing to this factor, CPCB has identified the Varuna’s stretch from Rameswar ghat to Adikeshwar ghat as polluted. “During monitoring it was observed that dissolved oxygen in upstream of Shastri ghat was found 2.5mg/L before mixing of drains. In downstream, where the drains from Ardali Bazaar mix with the river, the dissolved oxygen was found below detectable limits. This shows the impact of untreated effluent from slaughters mixing with the river, along with untreated domestic sewage. With zero per cent oxygen, it has made the water of river Varuna hazardous to public life,” said panel’s secretary Rajendra Singh. The EUP-RWRMC, chaired by Justice (retd) DP Singh, has recommended to NGT to impose an environmental penalty of more than Rs 27 lakh on Varanasi Municipal Corporation for non-compliance of Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. It has asked authorities to stop dumping solid waste at old Varuna bridge and other places within two months. It has also recommended that Varanasi administration and VMC must stop the flow of animal carcasses, blood and flesh from unauthorised colonies on the banks of the two rivers within two months. The NGT-panel has blamed the state government, UPPCB, Central Pollution Central Board, VMC, district authorities and Jal Nigam for pollution in the river. It has suggested to the government and district authorities to issue an advisory to people to not bathe in the Varuna and Assi as they are polluted. The panel has asked CPCB to inspect the two rivers in November this year. The water of the two rivers has been found to be unfit for drinking, outdoor bathing, fish culture and can only by used for irrigation, industrial cooling or controlled waste disposal, the committee has said.

Lucknow,Vasectomy fear: More women go under scalpel,"LUCKNOW: Women shoulder the natural responsibility of bearing children. But in Lucknow, they are also burdened with the duty to not have too many children, going by the higher number of tubectomies than vasectomies. On the eve of World Population Day, data from National Health Mission (NHM) for Lucknow show a chasm between female and male sterilisation numbers, which has only been growing over the years. The misogynistic disparity stems from a number of myths such as vasectomy “weakens manhood”. And, it is no secret that most Indian women are prone to “keeping their husbands safe” even at their own cost. NHM statistics from 2014-15 to 2018-19 reveal that on an average, the number of female sterilisations for family planning was at least 20 times more than male sterilisation. In 2014-15, there were only 0.4% vasectomies recorded in Lucknow, which by default means the remaining 99.6% sterilisation process involved women or tubectomies. Similarly, in 2015-16, female sterilisation was as high as 97.4%. The rate of tubectomies dropped to 85.9% in 2016-17 only to rise to 91.8% in 2017-18. In 2018-19, female sterilisation was higher at 94.2% against 5.8% vasectomies. “Men have been found to put the burden of family planning largely on women. There are myths surrounding vasectomy too. Many couples believe that the procedure decreases a man’s libido. They call it ‘weakness’, but it is a myth. At times, women are also put through the process to save family honour in cases of extramarital affairs,” said Poonam Muttreja, executive director of Population Foundation of India. Professor Yashodhara Pradeep, head of gynaecology at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Institute of Medical Sciences, pointed out that Indian women usually have a soft corner for their husbands and they deem it fit for themselves to undergo sterilisation rather than put the man they are married to through any “complication”. “Many women even ask for it while undergoing a C-section if they already have two to three children. There is also the myth that men won’t be capable of physical labour after vasectomy,” she added. "
Lucknow,"No teacher, several Lucknow University colleges to shut depts","LUCKNOW: It sounds bizarre but several government-aided colleges affiliated to Lucknow University have been managing their higher education with just one faculty member. And the quality of education has deteriorated further. Several departments, being run by a single faculty member, face closure with the retirement of 20% teachers on June 30. To teach around 20,000 students in 19 government-aided colleges, sanctioned teacher posts are 817. Of these, 197 are lying unfilled. According to University Grants Commission (UGC), the student-teacher ratio should be 1:40. However, it has crossed 1:50 in these colleges and would become 1:60 in the next session. In Shri Jai Narain PG College, for instance, 50 posts are lying vacant. Departments like geology and anthropology have no permanent faculty member. For 10,500 students, there are 139 sanctioned posts, but only 89 have been filled. The student-teacher has touched an alarming 1:90. “Around 50% of departments are dependent on guest faculty,” said principal S D Sharma. He added: “In geology, there are three sanctioned posts but two are vacant. The only faculty member is on leave.” For 4,000 students in Bappa Sri Narayan Vocational Degree College, sanctioned posts are 77, of which 31 are vacant. “If posts are not filled, many departments will face the threat of closure,” said principal Rakesh Chandra. Overall, he said, the teacher-student taught ratio is around 1:90. “Departments like ancient Indian history and Arab culture, which were running on a single faculty, have no teacher with the retirement of the serving ones,” he added. In Navyug Kanya Mahavidyalaya, there is only one teacher in departments of botany, education and philosophy for the past four years. In all, 19 posts are vacant with 3,500 students. Here, the ratio is 1:70. “The college, with its own resources, has appointed a guest faculty so that courses are not discontinued. The UP higher education service commission should fill in posts soon,” said principal Shrishti Srivastava. After a recent warning by the UGC to colleges and universities to fill vacant post within six months or else lose grant, the UP government on June 19 issued a circular directing higher education institutes to fill vacancies and upload data on the National Higher Education Resource Centre website. However, posts in LU-affiliated colleges are lying vacant because recruitments on all posts have not been done by the UP Higher Education Service Commission for the past few years. Regional higher education officer Rajiv Pandey said, “Information on vacant posts is being collected and will be given to the commission. They will be filled in soon. Two months back, appointments were done but not all colleges could be covered.” Lucknow University Associated College president Manoj Pandey said, “We have written it to the higher education department and deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma for filling vacant posts.” "

Total per district average rains this monsoon from June 1 till date have been 151.8 mm against the normal of 167.5% set for the period. Gupta said that the state, particularly eastern parts, received impressive rains since Monday evening, which contributed majorly in narrowing the deficit. "
Ghaziabad,"Husband of ‘Gone Girl’ granted bail, 2 more charges slapped","GHAZIABAD: Abhishek Chaudhary, the husband of Komal Talan (29) who had staged her own disappearance after leaving a suicide note in her car near Hindon canal five days ago, was granted bail till July 17 by a Ghaziabad court on Wednesday. Based on Komal’s statement given to Ghaziabad police on Tuesday night, police had added two more IPC sections – 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) in the FIR against Abhishek. Komal, a trainee manager with an insurance company on Barakhamba Road, had disappeared on July 5 from her parents-in-laws’ house in Delhi’s Pandav Nagar. A day later, her car was found parked under the Hindon Elevated Road in Ghaziabad with a note that said she was “going away”, and accusing her husband and in-laws of torturing her over dowry. The note and the location of the car, parked next to the Hindon canal, suggested she had committed suicide. On the basis of a complaint by Komal’s father, Anil Talan, a case was registered against Abhishek and her in-laws at Indirapuram police station on Saturday night. They were charged with domestic violence and kidnapping and under provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Talan claimed he had given Rs 41 lakh in cash and an Audi car as dowry to Abhishek, and that his family was demanding another Rs 21 lakh for starting a business for him. Talan also accused Abhishek of murdering Komal and throwing her body. However, Komal was found to be alive and hopping from one city to another to ensure that her husband landed behind bars for ‘murder’. Abhishek was arrested on Tuesday night after her return. Police removed the kidnapping charges from the FIR, but added two new IPC sections. Abhishek’s counsel argued that Komal had left on her own accord and there was no case against his client. The court of CJM Viveka Nand Vishwakarma subsequently granted him bail. Sources said that the dowry and domestic violence cases are likely to be transferred to Greater Noida where Komal’s parents live. Police sources said Komal was in touch with one of her friends from office and continuously talking to him from a new number and taking stock of the situation in Ghaziabad. She was planning to fake her suicide on Friday night itself, the day she went missing, but could not finalise the place to park her vehicle, they added. It was Komal’s friend, a resident of Noida, who had come to Indirapuram on Saturday morning to park the vehicle near Hindon canal and later dropped her at the Anand Vihar bus stand. From there, she took an overnight bus to Jaipur, went on to buy air tickets for Mumbai using the name Kamakshi, with forged documents, and finally boarding the Coimbatore Express. She was finally found travelling in the second AC coach of the train on Monday evening near Bengaluru. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Gangster shot at over parking contracts,"LUCKNOW: Gangster Gorakh Thakur, alias Virendra, was shot at to break his monopoly over parking contracts issued by Narkatiaganj Municipality in Bihar. This was revealed after the arrest of four persons involved in the attack, the GRP said on Wednesday. Thakur suffered multiple wounds when he was targeted by two men on a bike outside Charbagh railway station on July 2. Four persons, including two women, arrested have been identified as Miraj Khatoon, Mahi Talt, Mehrajuddin and Mehrajul. They were allegedly involved in the conspiracy while two shooters - Firdaus and Miktaul - are still on the run. GRP, Lucknow, SSP Saumitra Yadav told reporters that Thakur had over 23 criminal cases, including two murders and several cases of extortion and attempt to murder, pending in police records in Bettiah and West Champaran districts of Bihar. He was managing his gang in Bihar from Lucknow where he was living for the past six years using the alias Virendra.  Yadav said Firdaus, also a resident of Bihar, came to Lucknow in 2017 to pursue a diploma in electrical engineering from a private university. However, he dropped out after six months and took to crime. At present, he has five criminal cases, including attempt to murder, pending against him. He wanted to grab parking contracts of Narkatiaganj in West Champaran, on which Thakur and his gang had monopoly for the past seven years. "
Lucknow,CM Yogi Adityanath: Can’t get away by blaming driver for expressway accident,"LUCKNOW: In the aftermath of Monday’s bus accident on Yamuna Expressway, which claimed 29 lives, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has told officials that they cannot escape responsibility for the incident by putting the blame on the bus driver. The inquiry report in the incident, submitted to the CM on Tuesday, had held the driver, who also died in the accident, responsible for it. Asked how they had come to this conclusion, transport minister Swatantra Dev Singh was unable to give any explanation and was forced to cut short his press meet. Officials of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority have been asked to carry out regular inspections of the road to determine whether the company is implementing all safety norms, along with the 13 suggestions on road safety which were proposed by IIT-Delhi. Sources said that the CM was extremely angry with officials for the continuing spate of accidents. In a report submitted to him on Thursday, the transport department pointed out that almost 72% of road deaths in UP every year since 2015 were taking place on expressways and highways. In 2018, the total number of deaths on Agra Expressway, Yamuna Expressway, 58 national highways and 87 state highways was 15,997 as against 11,851 in 2014. The CM also expressed anger at the state of school vans and buses, saying that no lessons had been learnt from the 2018 accident in Kushinagar where at least 13 children had died when their van had collided with a train at an unmanned crossing. “The CM said that rejected vehicles were being used in schools to ferry children. From now on, all school vehicles will have to undergo regular fitness tests and condemned vehicles will be scrapped. All school van and bus drivers will have to undergo medical tests and police verification,” said an official. Yogi has directed that medical check-up of drivers, inspection of licence and breath analyser test before the driver enters the bus and when he reaches the destination should be carried out. On routes that are more than 400km-long and driving is to be done at night, there will be two drivers in each bus. A medical check-up of drivers attached to officials and ministers would be done as well. The use of mobile phones by drivers will now be strictly prohibited and if proof otherwise is submitted to the government, the driver can be fined. Besides, a weekly break will have to be guaranteed to each driver. The home department will ensure strict checking of helmet and seat belt use with a special drive to be carried out in Noida and Ghaziabad. A crackdown on stunt biking will be initiated while licences of those found driving in an inebriated condition will be confiscated. Saying that there is a need to reform the transport department on war-footing, the CM has said that illegal dhabas along highways need to be removed. Automatic e-challans must be started at toll plazas and highways, rumble strips should be constructed every 15km and staff of highway patrolling, Dial 100 and ambulance personnel should be given proper training.

Lucknow,Six-fold hike in Uttar Pradesh Board exam fee,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board (UP Board) has hiked examination fees for high school and intermediate board examinations in 2020 by six times. The fee for high school examinations has been raised from Rs 80 to Rs 500, while for intermediate examinations it has gone up from Rs 90 to Rs 600. Private students appearing in UP Board high school examinations will now pay Rs 700 instead of Rs 200, while those appearing in intermediate examinations will be charged Rs 800 instead of Rs 220. Candidates will have to submit the fee to their school principal by August 15. In April, UP Board had hiked the fee for re-evaluation of examinations by five times. The reason behind the steep hike, UP Board officials said, is to bring it at par with CBSE and CISCE to some extent. “We are still not charging as much fee as CBSE or CISCE since majority of our students come from rural background,” UP Board secretary Neena Srivastava told TOI. In CBSE, high school and intermediate students are required to pay Rs 750 for five subjects. A fee of Rs 100 is charged if they opt for an additional subject. The examination fee for ICSE and ISC students is Rs 1,500. State president of Madhyamik Vittavihin Shikshak Mahasabha (Secondary Self-finance Teachers’ Association), Umesh Dwivedi said, “At a time when the government talks about providing free food and uniforms to all, the fee hike is too much for rural students. How can the examination fee be hiked when the number of papers and examination duration in Classes X and XII have been reduced?” "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Plugged leaks can gift water to 1,000 homes","LUCKNOW: As many as 1,000 houses in the city can be provided with potable water for over a month without making additional arrangements if Jal Sansthan plugs all pipeline leaks. The water department supplies 850 million litres daily (MLD) to 4.58 lakh households in the city through a 900km network of pipelines. While 450 MLD is supplied through waterworks, 400 MLD is distributed through tube wells. However, at a time many parts of the city are grappling with water crisis, 5% or 42.5 MLD is lost because of pipe leaks, official records say. The average daily water consumption of a house with a five-member family is 1,250 litres. Thus, daily consumption of 1,000 houses is 1.2 MLD. If leaks are plugged, these houses can receive water supply for 35 days, explain experts. General manager of Jal Sansthan SK Verma said pipe damages were mostly caused by unauthorised digging. “We repair and replace old pipes with new ones on a regular basis. As a result, the rate of leaking water has come down to 5% from 8% in three years,” he said. "

The accused, Azad, is an autorickshaw driver. He lived in Loni with his wife Farzana (26) and two children. “The couple had been married for five years. Farzana used to work as a tailor from home. They lived in Sahibabad’s Shaheed Nagar earlier and had shifted to Loni 25 days ago,” a police officer said. Azad suspected his wife of having an affair, and late on Wednesday, the couple had a heated argument after their children fell asleep. “In a fit of rage, Azad thrashed Farzana. He then grabbed her by the throat and strangled her with his bare hands. He later told police that he was drunk and didn’t intend to kill her, but went too far,” SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said. After he realised that he had killed her, he sat with the body for around two hours thinking about whether to dump it somewhere or confess to his crime to police. “He decided to surrender himself to police.

Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh: Big CBI crackdown 3 years after PIL blew lid off mining scam,"LUCKNOW: The statewide CBI raids on the premises of five IAS officers on Wednesday were a sequel to a focused crackdown on a multi-crore mining scam in Uttar Pradesh that has prevailed for years. A public interest litigation (PIL) had blown the lid off the scam when the Allahabad high court, on July 28, 2016, had directed CBI to gauge the extent of the scam and investigate it. The HC had observed that the then-Samajwadi Party government had failed to introduce any technological intervention to curb illegal mining or introduce measures to stop plundering of natural resources through a modus oprandi that allegedly saw massive irregularities in allotment of lease for mining. A senior CBI official said that the court order stated that new mining leases on and after May 31, 2012 would be made only by ‘e-tendering’. All old applications would stand rejected. However, on February 26, 2013, the state issued an order stating that all approvals given prior to September 2012 would be treated as valid. Hence, CBI short-listed seven districts—Shamli, Hamirpur, Fatehpur, Siddharthnagar, Deoria, Kaushambi and Saharanpur —and began probe on these approvals in September 2012. By then, the government had changed and FIRs began to be registered. The first FIR was registered in Kaushambi in June 2017. Ten people were booked including assistant geologist Arvind Kumar. According to CBI, Kumar had allegedly entered into a criminal conspiracy with eight other individuals to ensure that mining lease for minor minerals was allotted to the latter for 2015-2016 by completely overlooking the e-tendering process. In Shamli, assistant geologist Adal Singh was booked for the same. In January 2019, CBI also booked then-Hamirpur DM B Chandrakala and three other public servants for allowing illegal mining between 2012 to 2016. In Deoria, CBI registered an FIR against IAS officer Vivek and his deputy DS Upadhaya, three public servants and four others. Then-DM Deoria Vivek had allegedly renewed mining lease for businessmen Phool Badan Nishad and Sharda Yadav despite objections by high court. Then-additonal DM Deoria DS Upadhyay was accused of criminal conspiracy. Subsequently, CBI booked UP principal secretary (geology and mining) Jiwesh Nandan, special secretary Santosh Kumar and then-Fatehpur DM Abhay Singh for allegedly colluding with Gayatri Prajapti, the minister for mining in the SP government. They were accused of favouring two businessmen by granting mining lease of 90 and 100 acres. "
Kanpur,Cops taking bribe in gambling video in Etawah jail viral,"KANPUR: In another shocker, a video showing inmates gambling inside Etawah district jail went viral on social media on Thursday. In the video policemen could be seen taking bribe from prisoners in lieu of allowing illegal activities in the jail. Besides, an illegal canteen being run in the jail was also shown. The video was recorded on a mobile which inmates are not allowed to have inside the jail premises. Jail superintendent Raj Kishore Singh said that the video seems to be recorded in past and suspected some conspiracy. “No such activity is going in the jail premises at present. Video seems to have been recorded in past which has been made viral with some malafide intention to tarnish the image of jail administration,” said jail superintendent. The video comes after footages of Naini, Raebareli and Sultanpur jails had caused flutter a few days ago. In recent past, four more videos had gone viral in which Unnao jail inmates were seen brandishing firearms, mobile phones and consuming liquor.

Kanpur,Uttar Pradesh: High alert sounded as Pandu level rises,"KANPUR: The district administration has sounded a high alert as the water level of the Pandu river, a tributary of the Ganga, is rising following continuous rainfall since the past 48 hours. Insisting that the situation was under control, the district administration, however, said all the necessary arrangements have been made to tackle the situation. “The water level in the Ganga has reached 112.36 metres, which is 65cm below danger mark, but has given rise to water level of Pandu river. As of now we are continuously monitoring the situation,” said an official at the flood control room. “We have put villages on banks of river Pandu on high alert,” he said. Officials of the concerned departments, including Kesco, KDA, Nagar Nigam and district supply office have been engaged. They went around the villages in the catchment area of river Pandu alerting people on the possibility of flood. They had also kept ready schools, community welfare centres and wedding halls to relocate people if the water level rises. “Locals have been advised to move all their cattle or any temporary settlements to safer places. We are watching the weather closely. The rain in the coming days will have an impact on the weather conditions,” said a senior district official. The district administration has already made adequate arrangements to meet any sort of situation in wake of the heavy rain warning. A contingency plan has been prepared. “A control room is functioning round the clock at the Collectorate. We are fully equipped to deal with any kind of emergency,” said district magistrate Vijay Vishwas Pant.

Lucknow,Cycle of change: Pedal power for girl education in Barabanki village,"LUCKNOW: Every year, a little over 5 lakh girls in Uttar Pradesh leave school and take up household chores. Girls from Barabanki’s Chandrawa village would have become part of that statistic this year but an opportunity for further studies came on wheels for them. Deepmala, 10, would have met the fate of her elder sister had it not been for Kishori Cycle Bank started by village head Prakashini Jaiswal. “Without this, I would have got married in a few months. The moment girls quit school, the families start looking for a suitable match for them,” said the young girl. Like Deepmala, all eligible girls in the village took admission to secondary school in the academic session that began on July 1 in what was a shift from previous years. This was because of a “cycle bank” that was started by Prakashini, who champions the cause of girls’ education. “In my village, many girls could not go to school beyond class 8 as the secondary school was over 6km away from the village, which deterred parents,” she said. “Distance, cost of travel, lack of public transport and safety issues were their worries. But, everyone agreed to send girls to school if it was nearby,” recalled Prakashini. While starting a new school was not easy, Prakashini thought of an alternative. “Girls who had a cycle were taking admission to the secondary school because that assured parents. However, those who did not were left behind. Because not all families could afford it, we thought of starting a cycle bank,” stated the progressive village head. The ‘bank’ started with 15 cycles parked at Prakashini’s home. These were bought by the gram panchayat, donated by social organisations and even by villagers themselves. The cycles, now 25 in number, are used by the girls as needed and returned to the panchayat. The move led to immense success and appreciated on many fronts. Calling it a practical and effective tool for girl child empowerment, social policy specialist at Unicef Piush Antony said that the move will have a lasting effect on the life of these girls. “The girls will be saved from teenage marriage. Higher education will also improve quality of life,” she said, adding it was a model worth emulation. "

A few hours later, Joshi was arrested. After investigation, she was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days by the chief judicial magistrate. On the same night, a group of masked men stormed Joshi’s house at Sarojini Naidu Marg in Lucknow armed with iron rods, sticks and petrol cans. They went on the rampage, sprinkled petrol and set the house ablaze. CB-CID investigation found the role of then- BSP MLA Jitendra Kumar Singh alias Bablu along with Intezar Abidi alias Bobby in the arson. In 2015, CB-CID had sought prosecution of 18 police officers for framing innocent people for the incident. "
Lucknow,"‘Jaicky’ defends jail staff, says viral videos plot to defame administration","LUCKNOW: In a bizarre explanation for emergence of videos from various prisons showing inmates brandishing guns, consuming liquor and enjoying lavish meals, jail minister Jai Singh ‘Jaicky’ on Friday said that this is an attempt to defame the jail administration which is otherwise doing a good job.  The minister remained silent on how guns, liquor and cellphones managed to find their way into jails and said he sensed a conspiracy against the government. Some officials and workers in jails, he claimed, were in collusion with criminals to bring a bad name to the government. “There are insiders involved in this and we are getting all videos investigated to see who is responsible. If I find someone guilty, I will dismiss them from service. The more important question is, why would these culprits make videos and leak them if they were genuinely getting facilities inside the jail,” Singh asked. TimesViewIn what appears to be a classic example of shooting the messenger, UP prisons minister Jai Singh ‘Jaicky’ has blamed the prison inmates for “leaking” videos of unlawful activities inside the jail while defending the jail officials for strictly implementing the jail manual norms. This has left unaddressed the fact that jail inmates are in possession of prohibited items and also have cellphones to shoot videos and proper connectivity make them viral on the social media.The minister had initially said that when the BJP-government was formed in UP in 2017, criminals were active from within jails. However, he said, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had acted to shift criminals from their choice of jails and transferred a large number of officials. “Criminal networks have now failed and therefore we are witnessing a new trend among criminals of shooting these videos and making them viral. When an official is strict, criminals often threaten to get them suspended. These videos are part of this conspiracy,” the minister said. He claimed that the jail administration was very strict and has clamped down on illegalities prevalent from the time of SP and BSP governments. “Sakhti karne ki wajah se hi to problem aa rahi hai aur yeh conspiracy ho rahi hai humare khilaf (It is because we are strict that this problem has cropped up and this conspiracy has been hatched against us),” he said. In the past few months, several videos from UP jails have emerged showing inmates with unauthorised possessions. In November 218, a video emerged from Rae Bareli jail showing inmates having liquor and making calls. In June this year, a video emerged from Unnao jail showing inmates brandishing guns and liquor bottles. Another video from Mau jail, made by an inmate, emerged in July this year. "
Lucknow,Draft law wants life term for mobsters to stop lynchings,"LUCKNOW: To clamp down on spate of lynchings, UP Law Commission has hammered out a draft bill that recommends life imprisonment for mobsters when victims die. District magistrates and policemen too won’t be spared and are liable to face imprisonment between 1-3 years if they fail to control mobs. On Wednesday, TOI was the first to report that law commission had taken cognizance of 50 cases of lynching and mob violence in five years and prepared a draft of Uttar Pradesh Combating of Mob Lynching Bill, 2019, and submitted it to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. In the draft, lynching has been defined as “act of spontaneous or planned violence by a mob on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, language, dietary practices, sexual orientation, political affiliation or ethnicity on mere suspicion of cognizable offence, not amounting to heinous crime”. Specifying that death of victim was not necessary to categorise the incident as lynching, secretary of UP law commission, Sapna Tripathi, said the penalty has been recommended on basis of severity of injury, leading to death. If a person suffers injury, accused can be imprisoned up to seven years and fined up to Rs 1 lakh. For causing grievous injuries, the penalty is imprisonment till 10 years and a fine of Rs 3 lakh. When a person is lynched to death, the draft Bill recommends rigorous life imprisonment for accused along with a fine of Rs 5 lakh. Even those who conspire, abet or attempt lynching will be considered to be accused and punished accordingly. The commission is of opinion that police and district administration should also be held responsible for “dereliction of duty”. This includes refusal to record FIRs. If charges are proved against a police officer or district magistrate, they can be imprisoned for 1-3 years and fined up to Rs 50,000. Those distributing offensive material can be jailed between one to three years and fined Rs 50,000. And those who contribute to creating a hostile environment can be imprisoned for up to six months.

Lucknow,"Patient dies in hospital, family thrashes doctor in Uttar Pradesh","LUCKNOW: Less than a month after pan-India strike in the wake of violence against doctors in West Bengal, a doctor posted at Balrampur hospital was assaulted on duty by female attendants of a female patient who died on Friday morning. Accusing the doctor of negligence, the attendants assaulted the doctor with a cane, when he was performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a 63-year-old woman. The hospital, in its official complaint to the police, sought action against the family members under medical protection act for assaulting an on-duty doctor and disrupting public service.  Urmila Singh was admitted to emergency ward’s bed number 12 on Wednesday night with septic shock and multi-organ failure. Hospital’s chief medical superintendent (CMS) Dr Rishi Saxena said, “We had told the family several times that her condition is critical and she should be shifted to a higher medical facility. But they did not pay heed.” As per the family’s allegations, the doctor was scheduled to report at 8am on Friday morning, but he did not turn up till 10am. “Even after arriving, the doctor attended to another patient despite our patient’s condition deteriorating. This negligence led to her death,” said a relative.  Dr Saxena denied all allegations against the 32-year-old doctor. “We are already facing staff crunch and after this incident, this doctor also wants to resign. Nobody would want to work as a doctor if attendants get violent even when we try our best to save lives,” said Dr Saxena. He added that the doctor in the middle of all this chaos, suffered injuries on his neck and head. "

Lucknow,A stamp to cement bonds between Ayodhya &amp; South Korea,"LUCKNOW: The ancient bond between India and South Korea is set to assume the shape of a commemorative stamp. The two governments have agreed to bring out a stamp on Queen Heo Hwang-ok of Korea, aka Princess Suriratna of Ayodhya. The philately division of the department of post, India, has sought information from the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) on the princess of Ayodhya. The ICHR has asked the state cultural department to help. According to official documents, “There is a widespread belief in South Korea and Central UP that in 48 AD, Princess Suriratna of Ayodhya travelled for three months by sea to marry King Suro, who founded the Karak dynasty in 42 AD. The capital of his kingdom was Gimhae City and millions of residents in South Korea trace their origin to the Karak clan.” The memorial of the princess, known as Queen Heo-Hwang-Ok or Queen Hu, in Ayodhya is a pilgrimage for South Koreans who consider themselves to be descendants of the royal couple. While there is enough anecdotal evidence on Queen Heo’s story, the department of post is looking for “authentic information, preferably from government sources, so that the Indian connection may be appropriately depicted on the stamp.” Officials in state culture department say they will decode the evidences such as the 11th century Korean chronicle Samyuk Yusa.

Lucknow,Deathtraps dot Lucknow roads as LMC takes a nap,"LUCKNOW: A Mumbai toddler playing near his home fell into a storm water drain through an open manhole on Wednesday night and drowned. A tragedy of such enormity is waiting to happen any moment in Lucknow, where uncovered manholes and drains are a common sight. A TOI reality check on Friday exposed these deathtraps everywhere, from Indiranagar, Gomtinagar and Hazratganj to Jankipuram, Kaiserbagh and LDA Colony. On August 6, 2017, a child had drowned in a high drain in the city’s Riverbank Colony. Two years down the line, the life-threatening hole still exists. TimesViewMumbai incident is a wake up call for the civic authorities. Officials must react promptly without waiting for a tragedy to happen. We need to keep our Divyansh safe. Not just humans, even life of an animal is precious. Steps must be taken to survey the entire city and cover open manholes and drains on warfooting. Municipal commissioner has promised action in three days. We hope he will keep his promiseThe Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) had covered the drain a few times, but the concrete slab somehow went missing every time. Several commuters have sustained minor or major injuries in the recent past as well, but the accidents have failed to jolt the LMC into action. Left with no option, residents have themselves barricaded some open manholes or drains with bamboo sticks, or at least put up warning signs. “The drain here is deep enough to drown a two-wheeler. Residents had pasted LED strips and put up no-parking signs, but these were either stolen or washed away in the rain. The gaping hole continues to pose a major threat to people, particularly children, during heavy rain when its depth cannot be easily gauged,” said Rashmi Sinha, a resident of Riverbank Colony. At Takrohi in Indiranagar, an open drain next to a government school feels like the inescapable jaws of death. “The drain has been lying uncovered for over a year now. Fortunately, nothing has happened to the children. But, there have been instances when they have accidentally dropped their belongings into it,” said Pratima Das, a concerned parent. A manhole at Ashok Marg in Hazratganj was found to be several inches below the surface of the road, making it invisible during heavy showers. “Every other day, a dog or a cat slips in through the manhole. Several two-wheelers have also met with accidents. What happened in Mumbai can happen here any second,” said Priyanshu Bhatt, a resident. People in Mahanagar play dodge daily as they commute on roads dotted with either open manholes or manholes with broken covers. “Open manholes pose a major risk at night and during rain, particularly when street lights are not working,” said resident Charulata Mishra. In Aashiana, Akshat Asthana of Sector K sustained minor injuries last Tuesday when his bike hit an open drain. At Shivpuram colony in Neelmatha, Jal Sansthan has dug up a trench to lay a water pipeline, but hasn’t finished the job. It is quite the grave for anyone commuting during a downpour. While residents voiced their anger and resentment over civic inaction, municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi told TOI that an order to repair/plug manholes and drains had been issued. “Work will begin within three days,” he promised.

Lucknow,Sugar mills divestment: ED files money laundering case,"LUCKNOW: Enforcement Directorate has registered a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act in the sugar mills divestment scam during the 2010-11 Mayawati regime. This comes two months after CBI registered an FIR in the case. The agency said disinvestment caused loss of Rs 1,719 crore to the state exchequer. ED officials said fake documents in the name of bogus firms were prepared to purchase 10 defunct sugar mills along with 11 operational mills as part of disinvestment scheme. “We will soon start searches at residences of those linked with sale and purchase of mills,” said an officer. Soon after coming to power in 2017, the BJP government on the basis of a CAG report of 2012 found 21 sugar mills were sold at “throwaway prices”, causing a loss of Rs 1,719 crore to the exchequer. In April 2018, CBI took over the probe in the case. Also, irregularities in bidding for two fake private companies to acquire tenders for sugar mills surfaced after a probe by Serious Fraud Investigations Office (SFIO) of corporate affairs ministry. The first FIR was registered at Gomtinagar police station on November 7, 2017, by S K Mehra, then MD of state Sugar Mills Limited. Mehra alleged two private companies — Giriyasho Private Ltd and Namrata Marketing Private Ltd — fudged balance sheets of financial year 2008-2009 with fake signatures to obtain tender. Giriyasho Private Limited had bid for sugar mill units in Barabanki, Ramkola and Chhitoni, while Namrata Marketing Private Limited had bid for mills in Deoria, Bareilly, Laxmiganj and Hardoi. A committee in UP Sugar Mills approved both the private companies as eligible for bidding in auctions by showing fake documents, said Mehra in his complaint to police. A case of forgery, dishonesty and falsification of accounts was registered. The government referred the case to CBI on April 4, 2018.

Lucknow,Lucknow: 400 vacant posts in five varsities ring alarm bells,"LUCKNOW: With more than 400 teaching posts lying vacant in four state universities and one central varsity in the city, students would be a disappointed lot as they won’t get the desired quality of education at the start of the new session. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has warned that these universities would lose grant if they fail to fill vacant posts within six months. The UGC had recently shot a letter to vice-chancellors, saying, “Shortage of faculty members in higher educational institutions (HEIs) is a major concern and needs to be addressed immediately for improving the quality of education.” Here’s a status report of the number of vacancies in these universities: Lucknow UniversityThe maximum 172 posts are lying vacant at LU. The total sanctioned posts at LU is 516 to cater to the student strength of around 25,000, which means one teacher should teach around 50 students. With only 344 permanent appointments in place at present, the student-teacher ratio has mounted to 1:70 from 1:50. The maximum 75 posts are vacant of assistant professors, while there are 37 and 60 vacancies of professors and associate professors. “We had filled the vacant posts in 2018 but thereafter there was a freeze on appointment by UGC because of change in rules. Hence, the process couldn’t be completed. We will fill the vacancies soon,” said vice-chancellor S P Singh. Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation UniversityA total of 156 posts are vacant in SMNRU. The student-teacher ratio is 1:60, which should be 1:20. This means 40 additional students are being taught by a single teacher. Total sanctioned teacher posts for around 3,000 students are 242, but there are only 86 permanent faculty members. Maximum 48 posts are vacant of assistant professors, while 12 and 22 posts of professors and associate professors are still to be filled. Two posts of special professors are also vacant. “The state government is yet to clear whether a roaster system by the central government will be adopted as it is or with some amendment,” said SMNRU spokesperson Ashwani Kumar Dubey. Dr Babasahebh Bhimaro Ambedkar UniversityThere are 33 vacant posts in BBAU. As many as 12 posts of professors, 14 of associate professors and seven of assistant professors have yet not filled. Of the 196 sanctioned posts for teaching 6,000 students, only 163 have been filled. Student-teacher ratio should be 1:30, which is presently around 1:36. “As a new vice-chancellor was not appointed for around seven months, vacancies could not be filled. We will follow UGC’s direction with immediate effect and will be recruiting soon,” said BBAU spokesperson Rachna Gangwar. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Arabi Farsi UniversityAs many as six posts of professors, 13 of associate professors and 27 of assistant professors are vacant at KMCAFU. Of the 74 sanctioned posts to teach 1,538 students, only 28 have been filled so far. The student-teacher ratio should be around 1:20, but it is presently 1:54 at KMCAFU. “Universities should be given autonomy to fill posts on their own as recruitment process is lengthy and rules of appointment change every now and then. Hence the post advertised in past could not be filled due to a rule change,” vice-chancellor Prof Mahrukh Mirza. Students shared that in the absence of faculty, new courses couldn’t be introduced. Dr APJ Kalam Technical UniversityA total of 18 posts are lying vacant in the only technical university in the state — Dr APJ Kalam Technical University. “We filled all the vacancies in the placement drive in 2018.

Lucknow,Modi-Shah duo will build Ram temple: Vedanti,"LUCKNOW: A day after Supreme Court (SC) asked the Ayodhya mediation panel to submit its report by a week, the executive president of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, Ram Vilas Vedanti, said the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo at the Centre would build the Ram temple within the contours of the Constitution in five years. Talking to reporters on Friday on the court’s decision to hold day-to-day hearings if mediation failed, he said, “Eighty per cent Muslims, barring fundamentalists, want the temple at the place where Ram Lalla is installed in Ayodhya.” Last year, the seer said if the Ram temple didn’t come up, he would immolate himself in 2019. On Friday, he skirted questions on self-immolation. “Take it as a threat or a suggestion, but there is no force that can rebuild the mosque at Ram Janmabhoomi,” said Vedanti. “Eighty percent Muslims in India want the Ram temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site, which is now presided over by Ram Lalla. Vishwa Hindu Parishad, saints and the entire Hindu community want the temple at the site, except Pakistan-funded Sunni Waqf Board that’s against communal amity. In fact, Muslims should come forward and build the temple,” he said. To another query, Vedanti, a former BJP MP, said it was unfortunate that in a country of 90% Hindus, people are fighting a legal case for decades for construction of Ram temple. "

The girl’s family said she kept mum for a year but in June, when they asked her to attend a relative’s wedding in Ghaziabad, she broke down and revealed what had happened. Police said that the accused had clicked obscene pictures of the girl and made some videos in his house in Kavi Nagar while she was taking a bath and molested her whenever her aunt was out of the house.

Later, in June 2019, when the medical student’s family wanted her to attend the wedding in Ghaziabad, she said she didn’t want to return to the city. “She still lives in fear due to the threat received from our uncle. She told me that if he posted the images and videos online, she would commit suicide,” her sister said. After the revelation, the girl’s family approached the Dehradun SSP in June and an investigation was launched into the matter. “The investigation report has been received by the Ghaziabad police and an FIR on the basis has been lodged against the accused under IPC Section 354 (sexual harassment) at Kavi Nagar police station,” said Shlok Kumar, SP (city), Ghaziabad.

Police said that under the one-month “girls/women security” campaign, the squads checked 7,529 people around schools, colleges and public places and issued warnings to 1,351 of them. “We mainly checked people roaming on motorcycles near educational institutes.

Ghaziabad,Neighbours rob couple with kid’s birthday party ruse in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: It’s difficult to turn down a little boy when he comes running to your house and invites you to his birthday party. The boy is a neighbour’s kid, you see him every day even if you don’t know the parents that well. You smile at him when your paths cross, even try to converse sometimes (“What’s your name?” “Which school do you go to?”). You surrender to his charms, the innocence melts your heart. You say yes. The Kumars, residents of Shalimar Garden in Sahibabad, were pleasantly surprised when their neighbours’ two sons, the younger one just five, landed up at their house on the morning of July 8 with the invitation to the 5-year-old’s birthday party. “The boys also asked us for our blessings,” says Abhay Kumar, still dazed by the events that followed. The Kumars had agreed, not realising that the invitation was part of an elaborate scheme by the boys’ parents to execute a robbery plan. Sending the boys, who enacted the plan in all innocence, was the first arrow fired. They were sure it wouldn’t miss. “That evening, when I returned from work, I wasn’t feeling well so I told my wife to go to the party and give the boy a birthday gift. My wife handed over the gift and returned after some time,” says Kumar, an RBS employee. But after some time, the boys’ parents — the Kumars’ next-door neighbours Adesh and Anjali — knocked on their door. “They came around 9pm and insisted that we have dinner at their place. They offered us snacks and soft drinks,” says Kumar. The drinks were laced with sedatives. The Kumars were soon asleep. There was Rs 10,000 cash in the Kumars’ house and jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh. When the Kumars regained consciousness, it was gone. A relative, Amit, found Abhay and his wife sprawled on the floor of their house the next morning when the family, worried they were not answering their calls, sent him to check. “When I sprinkled water on their faces, Abhay mentioned three words: cake, party and cold drink. I took them to hospital,” says Amit. Adesh and Anjali had come to live in the house adjacent to the Kumars’ four months ago. “We didn’t know too much about them. We didn't talk either as we weren’t sure about them,” says Abhay. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said an FIR was lodged at Sahibabad police station under the sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc) and 379 (theft) of the IPC: “We are trying to trace them and also checking CCTV footage from the nearby area.” Police have found that Adesh and Anjali are from Shamli.

Lucknow,Centre measuring how we spend our time,"LUCKNOW: A pan-India survey is under way since January 2019, the first of its kind in India, to measure an individual’s use of his/ her time, evident in the very term Time User Survey. Conducted by the National Sample Survey Office, it is being carried out in four legs from January to December. Talking about the survey, chief statistician Pravin Srivastava on Saturday, while inaugurating a seminar on Statistics and Sustainable Development Goals at Lucknow University, said, “While paid activity will straddle business and jobs which accrue income, the survey will be a fountainhead of information on time spent in unpaid ventures, including volunteer work, domestic and household service”. Conducted by the ministry of statistics, the sampling is being done under two broad outlines — paid and unpaid activity. The second sampling will be particularly significant as it will cater to data on time spent on household work, volunteering, among other activities. A pilot TUS was first carried out in 1998-99 across six states — Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Kerala and Meghalaya. It is for the first time the exercise is being carried out across all states. Srivastava explained the survey will analyse how people spend time. “There is much economic activity from their jobs, but with nuclear families being the trend, couples also spend much time in household work. For instance, cooking and rearing children by women helps men hit the field...” “But such activities have not been captured or collated till now,” Srivastava said. Read this story in Marathi"
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad call centre cheated policyholders, 7 held","GHAZIABAD: A fake call centre that was being run from a rented office at Cloud-9 in Vaishali area was busted on Saturday with the arrest of seven persons. The accused were allegedly involved in duping over 500 insurance policy holders. “They ran the call centre in the name of one M/S Italic Service at office no. 436, at Cloud-9 society’s commercial area in Sector 1, Vaishali area of Ghaziabad,” said a police officer. Police said the accused have been identified as Bharat Kumar and Gaurav Chandr, both from Vijay Nagar area of Ghaziabad, Sanjeev Singh, from Mandawali in Delhi, and four women, Jyoti Dinanath, Mamta Kumari, Puja and Bhavna, all of whom are from Delhi.

Shlok Kumar, the superintendent of police (city), told TOI that the accused claimed that the firm was under the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and targeted those whose life insurance policies were soon to get expired. “They would call up people and ask them to renew their insurance policies. When the respondents agreed, the accused would ask them to mail them their Aadhaar and PAN details. The accused would share with them account numbers where the renewal amount had to be deposited. Once the money was transferred, the accused would call up the respondents and confirm the transaction. Later, when the victims would try to get details of their policies, they would come to know about the fraud. When they tried to call on the numbers, they would find those switched off,” he added.  “The accused used to purchase data from one Ajeet, another accused in the case. He is on the run. Ajeet would sell the data of one person for Rs 10. It included name, address, contact details and details of insurance policy of a person. At a time, Ajeet would sell data of more than hundreds of people,” Kumar added. The call centre was being run for the past six months but the fraud came to light when an FIR was lodged by a victim at Indirapuram police station, alleging that a few people had duped him of over Rs 70 lakh. Apart from a fixed monthly salary of Rs 20,000, each call centre employee was given an incentive after a successful transaction. “All seven accused used to work with call centres in Delhi-NCR.

Lucknow,CCTV cameras and drones to monitor mining across Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW: From October 1, all mining activity in the state will be done under surveillance of CCTV cameras and drones linked to a command centre in Lucknow. The directorate of geology and mining, government of Uttar Pradesh, has taken up several technological measures to stop illegal mining activity in the state. UP has been a hub of illegal mining for a long time. Recently, acting on the high court order of 2016, a CBI investigation was sought into one such case after a public interest litigation. Acting on it, the CBI had registered five FIRs and one was registered by the Enforcement Directorate. During investigation, the agencies found that a multi-crore mining scam was run from 2012-16 but the then-government had taken no steps to curb it. Action began soon after the Yogi Adityanath-led government came to power. Mining special secretary and director Roshan Jacob told TOI that integrated mining surveillance has been done to stop illegal mining. The command centre has recently been established in the directorate. “It has been linked with all mines in the state and is being monitored by artificial intelligence-based CCTV cameras and drones. Geo-fencing is also being set up gradually. It will enable us to curb mining in any area where a lease has not been issued,” Jacob told TOI. For the first time, the government has also decided to attach a vehicle tracking system (VTS) to trucks ferrying minerals from mines. This will give an update to the command centre during entry and exit from a mining area. The mining department has also decided to partner with the transport and GST departments. A mining officer said that until now, only the transport department had the database of trucks, but now, it will be with the mining department. “After every boarding from a mine, a mining officer will seal and scan the truck on an app before sending it to the command centre,” he added.

Lucknow,Under-attack Bareilly MLA gets support from Dalit neta,"LUCKNOW: A Dalit lawmaker with BJP has come out in open support of the Bareilly legislator whose daughter accused him of unleashing death threats for marrying a Dalit. Shyam Prakash, MLA from Gopamau in Hardoi, sympathized with his colleague and advocated marrying within the caste. Only a father whose daughter or sister eloped and married a Dalit can empathize with Bareilly MLA Rajesh Mishra, alias Pappu Bhartaul, he said in a Facebook post. Prakash, who took to social media to air his views, also lashed out at a television anchor, asking if she would ever get her daughter married to his son, a Pasi. ""Will you ever propose marriage of your daughter with my son, the son of a Dalit (Pasi), to set an example and prove you practise what you preach? Along with what we do, you and I are social beings, you should remember that,"" Prakash said. Earlier, he defended BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra, saying those blaming him during television debates would understand his plight only if they ""suffered"" a similar fate. ""...they will understand the social embarrassment only when their own daughter or sister runs away with a Scheduled Caste man and marries him,"" he said. Mishra's son-in-law ""brought a bad name to the entire Dalit community and betrayed his friend"" and Dalits should boycott him, he added. On Wednesday, Mishra's daughter Sakshi released a video with her husband Ajitesh, saying she had married against her family's wishes and their lives were in danger. They also sought police protection from Allahabad High Court, saying if something were to happen to them, she would want her father behind bars.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Snubbed by lover, he donned a khaki uniform and took to crime","GHAZIABAD: He burnt the midnight oil and wrote the Delhi Police test — all to impress his girlfriend. But as luck would have it, Asish Chaudhary failed to clear the exam by a few marks. The 20-year-old youth didn’t want to lose his girlfriend, who dreamt of seeing him as a cop some day. He donned the khaki, posed as a cop and took his girlfriend to restaurants and hotels where he could exert his influence in uniform. This went on for a few weeks until Asish’s girlfriend came to know about the truth and severed all ties. And after a few weeks, she married another man. Thus started Asish’s eight-year-old journey into the world of crime. Now 28, Asish was arrested from Sahibabad on Saturday for a series of robberies where he looted victims posing as a policeman. The latest of his robberies had come three weeks ago, when he targeted a 25-year-old trader who was returning home with the day’s collection. “On June 21, he had robbed a 25-year-old man of Rs 50,000 cash near the Hindon air base. The victim, Rizwan Khan, runs a shop of construction material in Sahibabad area,” a police officer said. Rizwan said he was on his way home around 10pm that evening when Asish stopped his bike for checking. The accused identified himself as a constable attached with the Tulsi Niketan outpost. “He hurled a flurry of questions at me. When he found I had cash at hand, he asked me to come with him to the police outpost. He asked me to show the bundle of notes I had, got on to his bike and fled. I could not chase him, he had taken along the keys to my bike,” Rizwan said. The trader dialled 100 and a police team reached the spot. When Rizwan was taken to the Tulsi Niketan police outpost, the “constable” who had robbed him was nowhere to be found. “He became a fake policeman only to marry his girlfriend. But when his girlfriend came to know about the truth, she married another man. Since then, he started robbing people posing as a cop. He told police he had spent all the money in gambling and on a tour to Shimla with his friends,” SP (city) Shlok Kumar said. "
Kanpur,"Another death at Etawah safari, Jessica loses cub","KANPUR: One of the four cubs birthed by Etawah Lion Safari lioness Jessica died due to dehydration on Friday, even before it could turn a month-old. The cub’s death is the sixth one to be reported at the safari since 2014. The casualty deals a blow to the safari’s plans to breed more lions and to help increase the number of big cats living in the state. Brought in from Gir National Park in Gujarat in December 2015, Jessica had mated with one of the lions at the safari, Manan, three months ago and had given birth to the four cubs on June 26. Officials said that the other three cubs appeared to be doing well and were feeding on their mother’s milk. A safari official said that this was first cub that Jessica lost since being shifted to Etawah. “The cub was suffering from dehydration and had not been having its mother’s milk since the past few days. We had started treating the cub, but it continued to lose weight. On Friday evening, we noticed that the newborn was lying motionless. We separated the mother and the cub and found it to be dead. The cub weighed 800 gram at the time of death. Jessica had fed the ill cub milk till Friday noon. The other three cubs weighed around 2.40kg,” said director of Etawah Lion Safari Vinod Krishna Singh. “A team of four veterinarians took the cub’s carcass to Bareilly’s Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) for an autopsy, which would ascertain the exact cause of death.” A special team of safari doctors would be monitoring the other cubs’ health. Earlier, Jessica had given birth to three cubs Sultan and Shimba, and Bahubali in 2016 and 2018 respectively. The Etawah Lion Safari currently is home to four lions and two lionesses—Jessica and Heer—and three cubs—Sultan, Shimba and Bahubali. The work on the safari started in 2005, but smooth way was paved in May 2013 after environmental clearances. Since 2014, the safari has reported 10 deaths—two lions and three lionesses, and five cubs. The decline in numbers started with the death of Laxmi and Vishnu in October and November 2014 respectively, followed by the demise of Tapasya and Kuber. Four cubs died in July 2015 soon after being born and another one died in August 2015. Safari officials claimed that the four adult lions died of canine distemper. It is a kind of viral infection which also affects dogs. Following the lion deaths, safari authorities launched a vaccination drive for stray and domestic dogs in nearby villages to check the spread of canine distemper. "

The state government is considering giving an incentive of Rs 2,000 to those who carry road accident victims to hospital. Though the policy to protect Good Samaritans has been in effect since January 2016, it has failed to motivate people to save lives by taking those critically injured to hospital in the golden hour (crucial one hour after accident). A final decision on the move will be taken soon. The incentive will be paid from the Road Safety Fund and a special cell set up for this purpose might set aside Rs 50 lakh for the purpose for this financial year. If the proposal is approved, a corpus will be set up from next year. UP clocks the highest number of deaths due to road accidents every year. In 2018, in 42,568 road accidents, at least 22,200 people had died and 29,600 were left grievously injured. In 2019, from January till May, at least 18,500 road accidents have taken place in which more than 10,000 people have lost their lives. In 2016, acting on the guidelines of the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH), UP had implemented a policy saying that anyone who takes the injured to hospital after a road accident will be interrogated only once by the police and not face undue inconvenience. The interrogation will be held at the place, time and in the language preferred by the person. The person may also complain against harassment by police, if any, to the transport department. “The proposed amendment will supplement the existing policy,” said sources. The major role in the implementation of the move will be of the health department. Every hospital, including private ones, will have to be instructed to follow the rule. At the same time, people need to be made aware of the incentive. "
Lucknow,Meet the Samaritans who’re funding many a fair dream,"JHANSI: Books were always Anushukha Jatav’s best friend. Last year, the teenager sadly realised that her poor parents could no longer send her to school. She dropped out after Class VIII. And then, a miracle happened. She not just went back to school, but also cleared Class IX with 92% to make her parents proud. The 15-year-old resident of Bhaupura village in Konch block of Jalaun district is not the only lucky girl. There are 40 like her who are currently able to pursue their education because of a bunch of good Samaritans who are bearing the cost of their lodging and transportation too. The brainchild of Jalaun DM Mannan Akhtar, Kishori Samadhan Yojana is a Trust run through public funding. It has 40-odd members, including retired government employees, businessmen and corporate executives, who contribute both money and time to ensure meritorious girls from underprivileged families can continue with their education. “I want to complete school and college, and become an IAS officer,” Anushukha said, no longer afraid to voice her dreams. Father Chandrashekhar Jatav, who runs a small convenience store in their village, is supportive. “I have four children. It was not possible for me to fund their education. I am thankful to those who have taken the responsibility of helping my daughter pursue her ambition.” Incidentally, Jalaun is one of the most backward districts of India and has an adverse girl-boy ratio. Against every thousand boys, there are 865 girls while the national average is 945. Under such circumstances, girls dropping out of school has been a major concern. The Kishori Trust selects its beneficiaries on merit basis from eight Kasturba Gandhi residential schools, where they are taught till Class VIII. “Kasturba girls mostly belong to Scheduled Castes. Some come from poor families, some are orphans. Many are unable to complete school education. So, we decided to help,” DM Akhtar told TOI. Rajesh Kumar Sahi, who oversees the Kishori project and has contributed for the cause from his personal savings, said they had created a corpus of Rs 8-9 lakh for the education of these girls. Nilesh Singh (72), a retired principal who lives in Konch, has taken the responsibility of educating one of the girls till Class XII. “I have two daughters and a son who are well educated and settled. I understand the importance of education. Hence, I came to help in this wonderful initiative,” Singh said. Avinash Gupta (32), a manager with an insurance firm in Lucknow, said helping these girls brought him joy. “A friend of mine volunteers here and one day, he invited me to do so. It has been one of the best decisions of my life,” Gupta said. "

Kanpur,Air cheer: PM10 level dipping in Delhi,"NEW DELHI: The national capital may be the most polluted city in the country but the level of a key pollutant, PM10, has been consistently declining here since 2016 unlike in less polluted cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Bhopal, where concentrations of the deadly particulate matter has increased in the last three years. Analysis of data for 50 metropolitan cities for 2016, 2017 and 2018 showed a declining trend in Delhi, Varanasi, Ranchi, Raipur, Vijayawada and Bengaluru, among others, whereas the level of PM10 rose in Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot (all in Gujarat), Jodhpur, Kota (both in Rajasthan), Gwalior and Jabalpur (MP). The government shared the data on PM10 in Parliament recently. Though data on PM2.5 levels are also available, the information is sketchy as many cities did not start measuring concentrations of these finer, respirable particles three years ago. There was an increasing trend in PM10 level in 14 cities and decreasing one in another 14 while a fluctuating trend was found in 22 cities like Agra, Kanpur, Lucknow, Allahabad, Patna, Amritsar, Nagpur, Pune, Hyderabad and Chandigarh. Though the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in January to look beyond Delhi, aims to reduce both PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in 102 cities by 20-30% by 2024 from the level of 2017, the PM2.5 trend is currently available for only 17 cities. Analysis showed that many cities suffering from high pollution levels, including Delhi, Varanasi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jaipur, Mumbai, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, will continue to be polluted even if the target of reducing 30% of PM10 concentrations in the next five years is achieved. This means the current target is not enough to bring level of pollutants to the acceptable limit — that is, an annual average of 60 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) — by 2024. It may be possible only by scaling up efforts in these cities. Particulate matter can get deep into the lungs (particularly PM2.5) and some may even get into the bloodstream, causing serious health problems. Steady decline in the levels of PM10 in Delhi may be attributed to multiple actions such as leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standard, operationalisation of eastern and western peripheral expressways, implementing dust mitigation measures and closing down coal-based Badarpur thermal power plant, among others. Much more, however, needs to be done to substantially bring down the level of pollutants to the acceptable limit in the national capital and the other 101 cities identified under the NCAP. On PM2.5 levels in 17 cities, data showed an increasing trend in eight cities including Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat, Vadodara, Bhopal, Chennai and Hyderabad. The trend is quite worrying as it shows that PM2.5 level in five cities — Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat, Vadodara and Bhopal — has turned out to be hazardous in 2018 from acceptable limit (below 40 ug/m3) in 2016. Four cities — Chandigarh, Indore, Coimbatore and Asansol — showed a decreasing trend while the remaining five, including Delhi and Bengaluru, showed a fluctuating trend in terms of PM2.5 levels. In case of other pollutants, the data showed that sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels were within the acceptable limit in all 50 cities during 2016-18 while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in 17 cities showed an increasing trend. Of the rest, 16 cities showed a decreasing trend, 16 others showed a fluctuating trend and one city showed steady concentration. Under the NCAP, the Centre has identified 102 cities, based on ambient air quality data for the period 2011-15 and the WHO report of 2018, for implementation of city-specific action plans. A total of 86 city specific plans have so far been approved for actions. "

Lucknow,Serial cow deaths: Yogi Adityanath shunts out eight officials,"LUCKNOW: Battling an escalating crisis in government-run cow shelters with a climbing bovine death toll, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday suspended eight officials, including chief veterinary officer of Mirzapur and three government vets in Ayodhya. He also issued a stern warning to officials to maintain cow sheds, arrange fodder or face the music. Taking cognizance of starvation deaths of 15 cows at a gaushala in Ayodhya, the chief minister swiftly convened a video conferencing with all 75 district magistrates and warned that cow deaths would invite immediate disciplinary action. Also, owners who abandon cattle on streets after milking them will be punished. Civic authorities in Lucknow, too, were put on notice if they failed to curb stray cattle menace on streets from Amausi airport to city arteries. During video conferencing, an agitated chief minister ordered suspension of block development officer, Milkipur, deputy chief veterinary officer of Ayodhya, village panchayat officer and two veterinary doctors of Ayodhya Municipal Corporation. Shocking video clips of cow carcasses lying on marshes at an Ayodhya shelter and the subsequent outcry from seers of the temple town drew attention of the chief minister, who not only announced suspension of five officers of the district, but also held out a stern warning to others. Dr A K Singh, chief veterinary officer of Mirzapur, and executive officer of Mirzapur town were also shunted out and the commissioner and district magistrate, Mirzapur, were asked to probe into circumstances that led to cow deaths in the district. Herding cows in schools: Yogi Adityanath warns of actionAfter 30 cows were electrocuted in Allahabad, the chief minister asked the commissioner to probe into the deaths and recommended action against officials responsible for maintenance of gaushalas, where trapped cows died after an electric pole fell on the waterlogged shelter. Amidst protests by farmers and people over cattle trampling upon crops or triggering accidents on streets, the Yogi government told district magistrates to rehabilitate abandoned cows in new shelters, while announcing a budgetary corpus for protection of bovines. On Sunday, the chief minister said, panchayat officials will be taken to task if cows were herded on school campuses. The Yogi government also slapped Rupee 1 cess on sale of every liquor bottle to generate funds. But district-rung officers struggled for funds to mobilise fodder for cows every day. With the first big crackdown by the Yogi government against veterinary doctors, district officers and cow owners, it has to be seen whether the BJP government will be able to stave off the cow crisis in the state.

Lucknow,Mining scam: Former UP mantri Gayatri Prajapati's sons under ED lens,"LUCKNOW: The Enforcement Directorate has begun probe into firms floated by former Samajwadi Party minister Gayatri Prajapati's sons in connection with UP mining scam. The development comes amid CBI investigation into UP mining scam involving lease issued to businessmen in alleged connivance with IAS officers and flouting of e-bidding norms. The former minister's son Anil Prajapati has been director in as many as five companies - MSG realtors, MAGS Enterprises, MGA hospitality, MSA Infra Venture and MGM Agrotech Pvt Ltd since 2014. The same five firms have his other son Anurag also as director along with MGA colonisers which was floated by Gayatri Prajapati in 2009 but he had forsaken the directorship in 2013. Anurag has quietly withdrawn from six companies - Decent Contractors, Shubhang Exports, Lifecure Medical, Kanha Buildwell, Excel Buildtech and Daya Builders - since 2014 where too he was a director. ED is probing whether these companies completed any business transaction or were used to route kickback amounts from mining leases for 100 and 90 acre sites offered to two Fatehpur businessmen, Shiv Singh and Sukhraj, who, Gayatri Prajapati, allegedly gave favours despite several objections on environment and pending government dues from district administration officials. ‘May summon Gayatri sons’ED officials claim the companies were allegedly used to buy residential and commercial assets in Amethi, Rae Bareli and Lucknow, but the firms were either not filing mandatory returns before ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) or not conducting any business. The officials also said that Prajapati’s two sons may be summoned to explain the share-holding pattern in the companies as well. Asked about the mining scam, Anil Prajapati said that he was out of Lucknow and would only reply to investigation agencies. “I am out of the city. Summons were issued to my father, not to any other family member. If required, we will share the details on companies with agencies,” he said. Gayatri was recently shifted from Lucknow jail to King George’s Medical University in Lucknow after he complained of illness. He has been in the jail after a rape case was registered against him in 2017. Prajapati’s family has been active in Amethi for long. "
Lucknow,"Muslims, Dalits to go for arms licence in self-defence against mob lynchings","LUCKNOW: Reeling under the fear of mob lynchings, Dalits, tribals and Muslims will be applying for arms licences for self-defence - a pan-India movement which will commence in Lucknow on July 26. The brainchild of Supreme Court lawyer Mehmood Pracha, the first camp will be organized in Lucknow on the invitation of Shia cleric and general secretary of Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind, Maulana Kalbe Jawad. Pracha said, these camps would be organized in at least 12 cities, including six in Uttar Pradesh, where these communities are under threat and need legal help. Speaking to TOI, Pracha said, ""SC/ST and minorities have been pushed to the edge by the government, which is soft on perpetrators of mob violence. In such a scenario, there is no option left, but self-defence."" ""Many from these communities face discrimination and they will avail of our legal expertise to fill forms and apply for arms licence,"" he said. The camp will ensure that applicants with criminal antecedents or those with political or business interest, will be kept out. ‘Drive not about Shias only’“Once they get the licence, we will deploy experts for arms training. And we will act against those who misuse their licence,” he said. Speaking to TOI, Maulana Kalbe Jawad said, “Legal experts will be coming to Lucknow for holding the camp. Clerics from others sects will also be included as the movement is not about Shias alone. The brunt of mob lynching is borne by Sunnis and Dalits.” Pracha said, “If the government took strong steps against perpetrators of hate crime, we would not have had to take up such a measure. There are tough laws in the Constitution and Indian Penal Code (IPC) which the government should invoke. The draft bill on lynching is a mere eye wash. If the government wakes up, we will withdraw the movement,” he said. "
Lucknow,Coast Guard's combat pilot jumps to death from apartment's 9th floor in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: A deputy commandant of the Indian Coast Guard, who was among the first four women to be trained to pilot a combat hovercraft after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, apparently jumped to her death from the ninth floor of an apartment in a posh residential complex in Lucknow on Sunday morning. Preliminary investigation suggest Sneha Kathayat (32) had an argument with her husband over undergoing martial arts training. Police have sent the body for post-mortem and are scanning CCTV camera footage that show her taking the elevator outside their flat and then the stairs to reach the top floor of the building.

Security guards informed the caretaker of the apartment and later, Supriya identified her. Sneha's husband Arvind Singh, a pilot with private commercial airline, reached the city from Pratapgarh and gave his statement at SGPGI police station.

Relative humidity is likely to remain high, but the sultriness may be less compared to last week. ""A low-pressure area over east UP, which was responsible for heavy showers last week, has weakened and is resulting in a decline in rainfall activity. The rain will remain subdued for a day or two.

""The El Nino effect is basically responsible for the episodic monsoon, with only some parts of the state receiving rainfall. A shifting low-pressure area has also affected the intensity of monsoon,"" said station director professor Dhruv Sen Singh. "
Ghaziabad,Delhi IRS official says wife stole secret data to blackmail,"GHAZIABAD: A senior IRS officer has lodged a police complaint accusing his wife of stealing private and confidential information from his mobile phone and blackmailing him with it.

They also hacked videos and photographs and started blackmailing me with them,” he wrote in the complaint. The officer said that his wife had started pressuring him to severe ties with his parents and relatives and stay with her only. “On April 23, 2018, one of my wife’s brothers came to my house and threatened me with dire consequences if I kept meeting me parents,” he said.

Lucknow,"Chaos continues in Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport parking, lanes","LUCKNOW: Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Amausi has become the definition of chaos with no one to manage vehicles outside the terminal even two weeks after the Airports Authority of India (AAI) introduced parking fees and penalties. The blatant violation of pick-up and drop-off rules was highlighted by TOI in its Saturday edition, but neither reality nor reports seem to be enough to jolt the authorities out of their slumber. On July 1, the AAI had revised parking fees and the same was said to have been implemented by Amausi officials the next day. The new rate for four-wheelers was halved to Rs 30 for the first 30 minutes so that those coming to the airport to see off family and friends didn't feel the pinch. Two days after the AAI order, airport officials had told TOI that extra manpower would be harnessed to manage the parking lots. But, chaos reigned supreme on Friday and also on Sunday, when this newspaper visited Amausi a second time. Haphazard and unauthorised parking was the order of the day along both pick-up and drop-off lanes. According to the new rules, a vehicle can halt without charge only for three minutes. But, many people, including VIPs, were seen parking their vehicles for an hour or more and not being penalised for the same. Reema Saluja, who arrived from Delhi, had to wait for several minutes before she could cross the lane. ""Such poor management of terminal space is frustrating, especially when you have two pieces of heavy luggage,"" she said. Kuldeep Shukla who came to receive his parents also complained of haphazard parking. ""I couldn't drive my way through the maze of parked vehicles.

Lucknow,St Francis' old boys give reunion a Sunday style,"LUCKNOW: What looked like a wild idea when conceived by five friends eight years ago is today a weekly reunion like no other. Jashn-e-Itwar, a morning tea gathering of old boys of St Francis' Inter College, Lucknow, entered its 400th edition this Sunday, with 150-odd alumni and their families coming together at a tea stall to take a walk down memory lane. Shantanu Kumar of 1991 batch, who now owns a firm that runs online executive management training programmes, said the idea of turning Sundays into fun days struck them while sipping tea at a famous stall in Hazratganj. It was implemented on November 2011. ""The idea was circulated through social media groups and received overwhelming response. And today, our Jashn-e-Itwar group has 5,000 members. Even teachers come to these gatherings,"" he said. Besides Kumar, the founding team also comprises his batchmates Mohit Jaggi, now a printing press owner; Nitin Suri, a garments merchant; Syed Zafar, a financial consultant; and Maulik Sikka, an IT professional.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Policemen, health workers botch up baby girl rescue","LUCKNOW: Maggots were found in the private parts of a four-day-old girl who was spotted in an undergrowth along the road in Mohanlalganj area on Saturday, but put on ventilator support at a private hospital in the city only on Sunday. Doctors said the abandoned newborn was grappling with bloodstream infection and the next 72 hours were crucial for her. The child welfare committee has summoned policemen and health workers concerned on Monday to inquire into the alleged failure to follow protocol and consequent delay in providing her proper medical attention. Local villagers heard a baby crying and found the girl in the bushes on Saturday evening. They informed Mohanlalganj police who allegedly took her to the community health centre instead of a hospital equipped to care for newborns. The health centre referred her to a well-equipped hospital, but she was taken to a government hospital in Kaiserbagh that is lacking in life support systems. A health worker associated with NGO Asha, identified as Savitri, dialled Childline at 1098 from the hospital and allegedly vanished. On Sunday, the baby's condition deteriorated because the government hospital had no ventilator. She was finally admitted to a private hospital in Dalibagh by Childline. ""The girl is a preemie and underweight. We removed around 30 maggots from her private parts. There were also insect bite marks on her legs and forehead. She has bloodstream infection and the next 72 hours are crucial for her,"" said Dr Mirza Waqar Beg at the Dalibagh hospital. Member of child welfare committee Sangeeta Sharma said the station house officer of Mohanlalganj police station and Asha worker Savitri had been summoned for questioning. ""They were not following protocol. Childline should have been informed first about the abandoned baby. Their negligence in handling the case may be responsible for the baby's condition,"" she added. Mohanlalganj SHO Gaudin Shukla said, ""We received an information about the baby around 6.30pm (Saturday) and immediately took her to the health centre and then to a state hospital along with a woman constable and an Asha worker. We are trying to locate her parents."" "
Lucknow,"Skin infections stalking minors in Uttar Pradesh, show data","LUCKNOW: One in four children screened under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) were found to be suffering from skin diseases. Health department data suggest over 13 lakh children, in the 0-18 years age group, were examined for diseases, defects and deficiencies across 75 districts of the state in the past three months. Of them, 55,049 were found to be ailing and 14,000 — almost 25% — had skin diseases. In 2018-19, prevalence of skin diseases among children was found to be lower at around 20%. The screening programme was launched under National Health Mission in 2014 to ensure early diagnosis of diseases, defects, deficiencies and disabilities in children under 18 years. The state health department has recently launched an application to monitor the scheme, which had reached out to over 2.87 crore children last year. The app records data against 38 diseases and is also used to follow up on the referred children. “Real-time data of medical tests will help understand patterns and trends of diseases, which will in turn aid strategy improvement,” said Anupam Srivastava, the programme officer monitoring the software solution. General manager, RBSK, Dr Manoj Shukul maintained that effective monitoring of the programme would go a long way in improving the overall state of child and adolescent health in UP. “The insight gathered from the programme will help us bring down the infant and under-five mortality rates, besides checking problems such as anaemia,” he said. Apart from skin diseases, close to 9,000 children with severe malnutrition were also identified during the exercise. Vitamin-A deficiency was noted in 5,083 children while 2,622 were found to be acutely anaemic. Over 600 children were diagnosed with rickets, a skeletal disorder caused by lack of Vitamin D, calcium or phosphate. As many as 684 children were diagnosed with congenital heart disease while an equal number were seen with a club foot. Cleft lip and palate were seen among 412 children while neural tube defect was detected in 166 children. "
Lucknow,"Get 50 into fold, grab a party post: BJP to cadre","LUCKNOW: Seeking to expand its footprints in politically-crucial Uttar Pradesh through its ongoing membership drive, BJP has introduced a competition of its kind among its cadre - get 50 people on board and hold a party post in their respective district. Successful members will also get a chance to choose party ranks at booth and state levels. The party has set a target of making at least 50 lakh primary members during a month-long drive, which is seen to be crucial in the aftermath of UP regional giants SP and BSP severing their alliance. This, political experts said, would allow BJP to make inroads into the core vote bank of SP and BSP which had come together to arrest the saffron juggernaut in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections. There are around 75,000 active members of BJP in UP. The decision was recently taken by BJP working president Jai Prakash Nadda during his visit to Lucknow, where he held a marathon meeting with state BJP leadership and tasked them to expand the party in the areas where it is weak. BJP, as a matter of fact, has identified around 30,000 such booths where it could not register a win in the 2017 UP assembly elections and and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. BJP sources said every active party member has been given a bundle of 50 booklets, highlighting the achievements of the state and central governments for being distributed among the people. ""Social media platforms will also be used to make primary members,"" said UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi, conforming that those members who are able to make 50 primary members would not only be recognized as a party leader but will also be able to chose party ranks at booth and state levels. Sources said party functionaries have been asked to look out for beneficiaries of the state and the central government schemes and take them into party fold. "
Lucknow,Why KGMU’s burn care unit is still stuck in limbo,"LUCKNOW: Three years ago, it was announced that the plastic surgery department of King George’s Medical University (KGMU) will have a burn care wing. A year ago, the medical education department claimed it was launching the unit. Cut to present day: the facility is still under lock and key, waiting for the go-ahead to treat patients. The official reason for this inordinate delay is said to be government push for rationalisation of posts and resultant vacancies. According to officials, KGMU had sought sanction for 181 non-teaching posts, including that of grade III and grade IV employees. “We decreased the posts from 181 to 143 after the government’s demand for rationalisation and sent a fresh proposal,” said head of plastic surgery and in-charge of burn care professor AK Singh. “But, the request has been turned down again. The government wants us to reduce the numbers further. We have insisted that all the 143 posts are necessary to start the (burns) unit and that any query can be answered/ resolved in physical capacity for which we will be available,” the professor added. The department, which currently has three faculty members, also needs to recruit seven more plastic surgeons, four anaesthetists and four intensivists (critical care experts). "
Lucknow,Mouldable polymer plates to replace metal ones at PGI,"LUCKNOW: Metal plates and screws used in delicate facial surgeries will be replaced by mouldable and absorbable polymer plates at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences. Introduced by the institute's plastic surgery department, the mouldable plates have become the gold standard of precision in plastic surgeries and are also used in brain surgeries in select centres around the world. ""The biggest advantage of polymer plates is that they end the possibility of post-surgery complications caused by metal plates. The gain overshadows its otherwise higher cost,"" said Prof Rajeev Agarwal, the head of the plastic surgery department. He also said that SGPGI was the first centre in UP to be using these plates. From the patient's point of view, absorbable polymer plates can eliminate pain caused by piercing edges and even breakage. ""Injuries caused by the edges also prepared ground for infections and created the need for a revision surgery,"" explained Prof Agarwal. During the surgery, thin polymer flakes are first soaked in a water bath (special solution) to give them a clay-like texture. They are then applied on the affected area to complete the sculpting, explained Prof Rajeev Agarwal. "

Lucknow,Doctors losing respect due to commercial shift: Yogi Adityanath,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said respect for doctors was diminishing because of their priority shift to commercial goals. Yogi's observation came at the launch of 'Smile Mashal Jyoti' programme - cleft lip awareness campaign - from his residence in Lucknow. The CM said the emotional connect between doctors and patients was lost in this commercial age. The initiative is an attempt to restore dialogue between doctors and common man, he said. The chief minister's remark comes just days after doctors at Balrampur Hospital and KGMU's cardiac wing faced mob violence. Also, Yogi cited three reasons for failure of government schemes. Either the scheme was unplanned or there was lack of awareness or those responsible for implementation were lax, he said. Describing the 'Smile Mashal Jyoti' programme as a big campaign, he said if majority citizens join the awareness programme, it could be a mass movement. The CM felicitated children associated with Smile Foundation and released a book on cleft care by Dr AK Singh of KGMU. He also honored doctors from different districts. Earlier, a Smile Mashal Jyoti rally was organized at 1090 crossing in the state capital. An awareness campaign was also organised through a street play. "

Lucknow,"Riled with non-performance, Yogi Adityanath sacks Lok Kalyan Mitras","LUCKNOW: Upset at the functioning of Lok Kalyan Mitras (LKMs), chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered that all LKMs appointed so far will not continue in service after July 15. Lok Kalyan Mitras were appointed by the BJP government with much fanfare earlier this year to help in implementation of social welfare schemes across the state. ""The CM had been receiving complaints against them, including the fact that many were not trained properly and none of them were using the LKM application on which they were supposed to have updated details of their work. The agency hired to appoint LKMs also did not perform its job properly. UP Small Industries Corporation will now engage a new agency which will hire fresh recruits,"" said a senior government official. The decision to replace more than 400 LKMs has been taken ahead of upcoming bylections on 12 assembly seats. The move to appoint 822 LKMs across all blocks was taken by the state cabinet in August 2018 and met with fierce criticism by the Opposition which said that not only was government machinery already in place to monitor implementation of government schemes for which the LKMs were being hired but also alleged that the government would appoint people close to BJP. The appointment carried a monthly remuneration of Rs 25,000 and was to have been for a year, subject to review by the CM. The government had claimed that because of the immense work of implementing more than 100 schemes of the Centre and state, district and block level officials were under lot of pressure and LKMs would have helped in streamlining the work. They had been tasked with visiting beneficiaries in their respective areas to review how schemes were being implemented and connect a larger number of people with these schemes. ""The agency started recruitments late and had appointed just a little over 400 LKMs. Because of the complaints with their work, no payment has been released to them for the three months of their appointment so far. We are now looking to overhaul the system and see how many of the LKMs will be paid, depending on the quality of work they have put in,"" said the official. "

Lucknow,"High-tension wire falls on school, 53 hurt","LUCKNOW: At least 53 students sustained burn injuries due to electric shock when a 11,000V cable fell on the rain-soaked walls of a government primary school in Utraula village of Uttar Pradesh’s Balrampur district on Monday. The students were returning to their classrooms after having midday meal when the high tension cable — which had been dangling for months — fell on the building and burst, injuring the children. It also snapped power supply to the premises. While there were 110 children in the school, 53 in the class suffered electric shock. Some of them even fell unconscious due to panic while others sustained burn injuries on their limbs. While 30 children have been admitted to a private hospital, the remaining are in a community health centre. Balrampur district magistrate Krishna Karunesh has recommended action against a junior engineer and suspended a lineman of the power department with immediate effect for failing to remove the dangling wire despite complaints. Basic Shiksha Adhikari Harihar Prasad said, “Eyewitnesses claimed that the wire was dangling for several months and used to swing during heavy rain and wind. Villagers had made several complaints to the power department to remove the wire but in vain.” On Saturday, a tree had fallen over and broken the wire after heavy storm and rain. A rusty electric pole had also bent over one side. While linemen had repaired the cable, they failed to replace the pole. On Monday noon, as the children were huddling inside the classrooms, the pole collapsed and the wire fell over the walls. Instantly, electricity ran through the damp school walls and floor. Officials said power got disrupted within a second of the wire falling, resulting in disruption of supply else there could have been serious fatalities. The panicked teachers and headmaster stopped other students from entering the classrooms and rushed the injured to community health centre (CHC) and to a nearby private hospital. Karunesh said, “All the children are out of danger and some were discharged by evening. As many as 29 students admitted to the private hospital are undergoing treatment.” Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has instructed Karunesh to provide every possible assistance and treatment to the injured schoolchildren. He has also directed the managing director of Madhyanchal Power Corporation to take action against the people responsible for the accident. The CM has ordered the principal secretary (energy) and managing director of UPPCL to start a drive to repair high-tension wires across the state and remove high-tension wires passing over schools.

The scene was equally heart-rending at Motijheel in Para, where 32-year-old Deepak Singh — a senior analyst with a US-based healthcare MNC — lived. He had promised to come home next week to spend quality time with his family. “We were so excited... He loved music and played the guitar so well... How can god be so cruel?” said an inconsolable Vaishali, Deepak’s younger sister. Deepak’s father had died three years ago and he was the eldest among four siblings.

Police have also booked the van owner and school administration in the FIR, charging them with negligence that endangered life of children. Khan, police said, was driving on the wrong side when the accident occurred around 6.40am. Instead of driving around the roundabout, he took a wrong turn at Samtamulak crossing and the van hit a UPSRTC bus coming from the opposite direction. Back from the jaws of death: ChildThe van turned turtle, injuring four students-—Shivani Yadav (10), Anurag Yadav (15), Sahana Khan (15) and Ankur Yadav (15)—all students of a private school in Virat Khand. Locals rescued children and took them to hospital as well as informed their parents and police. TOI visited the injured students in the hospital. Anurag, who suffered injuries on the head and shoulder, said he was in the front seat while his sister Shivani along with Sahana and Ankur was in the back seat. “Neither I nor the driver was wearing the seat belt. As the van collided with the bus, I felt I would die. I lost consciousness for some time,” said a dazed Anurag. When he gained consciousness, he recalled, he heard Sahana and Shivani screaming. “People around us had started helping us out of the van,” he said. Class V student Shivani, who has diabetes, lost a lot of blood due to a head injury and cuts made by glass shattered from the window pane. “I felt a shooting pain in the head after the accident and within seconds, blood was all over my face and clothes,” she narrated the horrifying incident. Sahana, a class XI student, said, “After the car rolled over, I felt like I was going to die. There was blood everywhere and people had surrounded us. A man brought us to hospital in his car.” Khan said he had started driving the school van about a week ago. Before that, he drove a pick-up truck for a dairy company for about one-and-ahalf years. Shivani and Anurag’s father Raj Kumar (37) said he pays a fee to the school for van facility and therefore, the school is also accountable for ensuring safety of children. Supporting Kumar’s statement, Sahana’s mother Resham Bano said, “My husband works abroad and there is no one to help me if something happens to my child.” SP north Sukirti Madhav said, “We have registered a case of negligence against the school administration, vehicle owner and van driver.” Assistant regional transport officer Sanjeev Gupta said, “As per guidelines, the school van driver must have five-year experience but here was a 20-year-old. A person can obtain a driving licence only after 18 years of age, hence he did not have the required experience. The owner has to ensure these guidelines are being adhered to.” "

Villagers had made several complaints to the power department to remove the wire but in vain.” On Saturday, a tree had fallen over and broken the wire after heavy storm and rain. A rusty electric pole had also bent over one side. While linemen had repaired the cable, they failed to replace the pole. On Monday, as the children were huddling inside the classrooms, the pole collapsed and the wire fell over the walls. Instantly, electricity ran through the damp school walls and floor.

Lucknow,"UP: Now, restaurants selling liquor can stock more","LUCKNOW: Expensive brands of liquor, often unavailable at most restaurants, may now be easier to get. To improve the availability of liquor in the state, the cabinet has approved a proposal to allow restaurants and commercial establishments to stock mono cartons of liquor which costs more than Rs 4,000 per bottle. Till now, they were required to purchase a full carton of any liquor that they would be selling, often making it unviable to stock expensive brands. Now, they will be free to stock as many bottles as they like. The revisions in the excise policy have made it further difficult to sell illicit liquor, bringing in strong penalty for selling or distributing illicit liquor. Meanwhile, the penalty for selling liquor at a rate higher than the MRP will also invite a higher penalty. For the first violation, the new penalty is Rs 75,000 while the fine on the second violation is Rs 1.5 lakh. If violations continue, the seller will lose the licence. The amendments in the policy have also eased the rule on supplying liquor within three days of receiving the work order. At present, the rule states that all distilleries will ensure that liquor is supplied within three days of receiving indent. If they are unable to do so, they will be charged a penalty at the rate of 0.5% for each day of delay in supply. However, since there are many distilleries already at peak production but which are still unable to meet the demand within three days of receiving an order, it has been decided to exempt such distilleries from paying the fine.

Verma said she had withheld her own salary for 10 days when projects failed to be completed in time. “As GDA vice-chairperson, it is my overall responsibility to oversee the progress of progress.

This shows that there was a delay of at least eight hours between the newborn’s discovery and the required medical treatment to have begun at the government hospital where she was admitted on Saturday. When TOI spoke to SHO Mohanlalganj Gaudin Shukla on Sunday and Monday, he maintained that the newborn was found at 7pm on Saturday evening. “Information was received on dial 100 at 7pm on Saturday and immediately a sub-inspector was sent to the site,” he said.

The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) that has raised questions on the delay in providing medical treatment to the child at the hands of the police and healthcare worker, has, however, said that there is discrepancy between the time the girl was found and the time she got treatment. “Around 12.30pm, I received a call from someone from Mohanlalganj police station saying a newborn girl child has been found. I told the caller to contact Childline on its 1098 helpline and get the child admitted,” said CWC head Kuldeep Ranjan. However, Childline got the call only at 8pm. “When we reached the hospital, the process of patient admission was underway.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Leaking drain spurs 40m road cave-in,"LUCKNOW: Commuting on the Sector 14 road in Indiranagar has become a risky affair for three days now, with a cave-in leaving a 40-metre stretch out of bounds for both residents and visitors. The road caved in by 18 feet on Saturday night, as the soil beneath it weakened allegedly due to continuous leakage from a nearby underground drain. The maimed stretch is not only causing traffic disruption, but also frequent accidents including one that took place on Monday. Fortunately, no casualties or grievous injuries have been reported. According to residents, they heard a loud, crumbling noise around 8pm on Saturday and rushed out of their homes to see the road sinking. They barricaded the stretch to warn commuters and informed the public works department. A preliminary inspection by PWD officials has revealed that the damage was triggered by a leak in an adjacent, underground drain. Seeping rainwater, mixed with drain water, gradually eroded the soil base, leading to the cave-in. It is yet to be ascertained for how long the drain has been leaking. Residents accused Lucknow Municipal Corporation of not heeding their complaints about clogged, congested and weathered drains. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said work had begun to assess the extent of drain leak and fix it. ""A technical team is on the job. The PWD will rebuild the road once the LMC repairs the drain,"" he said.

He wanted to see his wife independent and insisted that she enroll for an MBA course. It was his wish, and Garima has always ensured that whatever Samir wished for is fulfilled.

Ghaziabad,5.6 crore Indians lived outside their state of birth in 2011,"More than 56 million Indians lived in states other than the ones they were born in, newly released census data for 2011 shows. While UP, Bihar, Rajasthan and MP had the highest ‘out-migration’, Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat saw the largest ‘in-migration’. Among larger states, Bihar had the lowest number of people migrating into the state with most of the one million plus migrants coming from Jharkhand and UP. In the case of UP, which had just over four million in-migrants compared to almost 13 million out-migrants, a lot of the in-migration could also be due to people from all of India flocking to the NCR cities of Noida and Ghaziabad. In Haryana too, Gurgaon and Faridabad could account for a sizeable chunk of the 3.7 million in-migrants. While the general thumb rule is that states with a high level of development have lesser out-migration and more people migrating into them, census data shows that states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh actually had higher out-migration than Bengal or Assam, clearly less developed than the southern states. And Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand actually had more in-migration than out-migration.

Contrary to the popular perception of Biharis moving in droves to Punjab, Haryana, Delhi or Mumbai, migrants from Bihar moved more towards the east. People born in Bihar thus constituted 62% of migrants in Jharkhand, 47% in West Bengal, 31% in Assam and other north-eastern states compared to just 18% in Delhi and 6% in Maharashtra.

Kanpur,"Waterbodies dying, Ghaziabad finally wakes up","GHAZIABAD: Worried about the falling groundwater table, the district administration has decided to go all out to restore and rejuvenate waterbodies. Ghaziabad has around 1,000 ponds and lakes in urban and rural areas, many of which, like Arthala, have been severely encroached on, reducing them in size. Removal of squatters is no easy job and could limit the outcome of this exercise. The step is similar to that of neighbouring Noida, which also fears a water crisis and has undertaken a project to revive wetlands. “There are 791 waterbodies in rural areas and 200 in urban centres. By August 15, we will rejuvenate 180 in rural centres and by September, 68 in urban areas will be attended to,” said Ramesh Ranjan, the chief development officer. “We have already wrapped up work on 57 waterbodies in both urban and rural areas,” he added.

The work primarily includes clearing encroachments and de-siltation to augment catchment areas. “Three years ago, we used to get funds to pay workers who were involved in rejuvenating waterbodies, under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). However, these days workforce is not available at the wage being offered. Therefore, local and urban bodies are spending from their own funds,” said Ranjan. Apart from waterbodies, the administration’s focus is also on rainwater harvesting systems on rooftops. “In every 161 gram panchayats, we have selected one primary school where we have installed rooftop rainwater harvesting systems and we are on the verge of completing 144 such schools,” said Ranjan. “We have also selected 9 offices at block levels where rooftop rainwater harvesting will be done,” added Ranjan. Additionally, 175 soak pits would be dug up in rural areas and 129 in urban areas. “The soak pits are being dug up near handpumps where water is made to sieve through sand and pebbles and this is being considered as an effective way to increase the groundwater table,” said Ranjan. He added three out of four blocks in Ghaziabad are in the dark zone. “Loni, Razapur and Bhojpur have been declared to be in the dark zone where groundwater table has receded to almost 120 feet and water extraction has been banned, except for drinking purposes,” said Ranjan. According the groundwater department, from 2013 to 2018, piezometer readings in urban areas of Ghaziabad also showed that of the 38 spots, 11 have gone dry. This means the water levels have plummeted so much that it did not register in piezometer readings. Makanpur in Indirapuram is one of these spots. The other areas are Krishi Beej Bhandar (Kaushambi), Zila Ganna Adhikarai (Surya Nagar), Bhovapur, Hindon Motel (Patel Nagar), Civil Lines, Lajpat Nagar (Sahibabad), Sikandarpur and Police Lines.

Lucknow,"Gomti Riverfront molesters army recruits, say police","LUCKNOW: Police on Friday confirmed that the four men, who were taken into custody for allegedly molesting a woman and manhandling a cop on the Gomti riverfront on Thursday and later released, were recruits undergoing training at the Army Medical Corps of Central Command. Spokesperson for Lucknow police Ashish Dwivedi said, “The accused belong to Army Medical Corps (AMC) unit and were released on personal bond from the police station because the victim couldn’t identify them.” Gomtinagar sub-inspector Sanjay Kumar Gupta, also the investigating officer, said two FIRs had been lodged. “The first by the woman and the second by the cop who was roughed up. We are investigating both cases.” According to the two FIRs, the incident took place around 4am. The woman was enjoying a stroll with her husband along the riverfront when a group of men made a pass at her. They molested her and assaulted her husband when they protested.

Lucknow,"Lapses in liquor policy cost Rs 24,000-crore loss to UP","LUCKNOW: A report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on pricing, production and sale of liquor in UP from 2008 to 2018 has found several lapses which have resulted in losses of around Rs 24,806 crore to the exchequer. These include irregular creation of special zones to prevent smuggling of liquor into the state which did not include two crucial border districts of Aligarh and Mathura, renewal of licences for retail shops for nine years without any open tendering and undue benefit to distillers by calculation of incorrect ex-distillery price, among others. The report has calculated potential revenue loss of Rs 13,247 crore to the government with the excise department failing to fix the minimum guaranteed quantity (MGQ) of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and beer. MGQ is the quantity that a retailer is bound to sell in one excise year. It should be fixed by the excise department but that was not done. “Short fixation of MGQ of country liquor during 2011-18 led to potential revenue loss of Rs 3,675 crore”, it said.

This zone was to include 15 districts. However, it was found that two crucial border districts of Aligarh and Mathura were left out of this special zone. Meanwhile, seven districts which were not close to the border were included. The report says that while this special zone failed to achieve the desired result, the system continued for nine years. As an example of its failure, the CAG report says that consumption of IMFL dropped by 38% between 2011-12 and 2015-16. Sale of beer too dropped by 6% in the same period. Between 2013-14 and 2015-16, revenue from sale of IMFL fell from Rs 3,672 crore to Rs 3,293 crore. The report further said that the various excise policies between 2008 and 2018 allowed breweries and distilleries to determine the ex-brewery price (EBP) and ex-distillery price (EDP) of beer and IMFL, the result of which was inflated costs of liquor in the state. Compared to neighbouring states, the cost of IMFL and beer was 46% and 135% higher in UP, leading to undue gains of Rs 5,525 crore to brewers and distillers from 2008 to 2018. Wholesalers and retailers also gained to the tune of Rs 1,644 crore due to the inflated pricing. Latest CommentHah you came to know today.. After creating ponty chadha and other mafia..

The excise department failed to detect this malpractice for 10 years and calculated duty at 180ml and 90ml, resulting in loss of excise duty worth Rs 228 crore between 2008 and 2018. Similarly, the department failed to detect the incorrect computation of maximum wholesale price of IMFL, leading to shortfall of Rs 4.85 crore in 2013-14. It further renewed licences for retail shops for nine years without reporting to open tendering and thereby eliminating possibility of competition in production and sale of liquor. "

Violations were rampant in other parts of Lucknow as well.

RITES, a consultancy organization of the Union government under the aegis of the Indian Railways, has been given 10 days time (since the initiation date) to submit a proposal on the corporatization of MCF. Though RITES is yet to start the survey, staff at the factory is up in arms against the move. On Friday, close to 300 workers protested at the factory gate holding black flags. “It is happening everyday since the start of July. At least 300 workers hold gate meetings on daily basis,” said an agitating worker. Rae Bareli MP and Congress Parliamentary Party chief Sonia Gandhi, on July 2, had raised the issue in Lok Sabha saying that government is “secretly” trying to privatise the factory. “Rae Bareli Sadar MLA Aditi Singh had come to support us. She took our memorandum and has handed it over to the rail minister,” said the worker.

Lucknow,HC nod to minor rape survivor’s abortion plea,"LUCKNOW: Considering the agony and trauma that the minor rape survivor may face if she has to give birth to an unwanted unborn child, Allahabad high court’s Lucknow bench on Friday permitted her to medically terminate the pregnancy, even if it crossed 20 weeks, which is the permissible limit given in Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. The court asked her to get herself admitted in KGMU on the day itself. The court also asked a panel of doctors to preserve the residue of the embryo so that it may be available for any scientific investigation. A bench of Justice D K Upadhyay and Justice Alok Mathur passed the order on a writ petition moved by the rape survivor’s father . It was pleaded that the girl was raped and became pregnant. An FIR was lodged against the accused person, who is nearly as old as the survivor’s father. The petitioner pleaded that under the MTP Act, since pregnancy of 21 weeks, as in this case, cannot be terminated and as such it is only the high court which could pass the appropriate direction to permit the survivor to get rid of the unwanted unborn child. On July 17, the court had directed KGMU to constitute a panel of four doctors to mull whether the termination can be allowed in the present case looking to the physical and mental condition of the survivor during pregnancy and after she has to give birth to the child. KGMU counsel Abhinav N Trivedi presented the report in the court on Thursday. The court then requested senior counsel JN Mathur and Bulbul Godial to assist it as amicus curie (friend to the court). On Friday, the two counsels suggested that it would be just to allow the termination. Meanwhile, an application was moved on behalf of the key accused through his advocates Chandan Srivastava and Yogesh Somvanshi, requesting the court that in case the court was permitting the survivor to terminate the pregnancy, the court should pass appropriate direction to preserve the residue of the embryo so that it can be used during investigation, as the accused was pleading for DNA test while denying that he was biological father of the unborn child. The court called upon government advocate Vimal Srivastava to address it. After hearing him, the court directed for preservation of tissues of the embryo after its termination so that it can be available during investigation if so required. "

Several well-known people of the city, including Jaideep Narain Mathur, former Additional Advocate General, UP, along with businessman Rajneesh Chopra, Amar Habibullah and Sudhir Halwasiya, among others, have their horses trained and housed at the LRC.  Giving us details of the cause and effect of the eviction notice, Abhishek Mani Tripathi says, ""The major part of the racecourse is on leased land. There is an association known as the Lucknow Race Fund which manages the race course and the land around it. The land had been let out to the LRF in 1978 and since then they were supposed to pay a stipulated rent of Rs 34,625 per month but they failed to pay it to the government. In 2017, the Ministry of Defence came up with a policy in which they gave all these people, who were not paying rent to the government of India, a proposal to pay the rent amounting to Rs41,37,927 and have their lease renewed and that it will be extended to December 31, 2019. So, we on the behalf of the government of India, because we are the ones who manage the land, sent a demand notice to them saying that please pay the rent. However, they declined it and categorically said that they will not pay up. So, on this ground, under Section 4 (1) of the Public Premises Eviction Act, 1971 we have declared Lucknow Race Fund (the body which manages Lucknow Race Course ) as as on July 8, 2019, as unauthorised occupants and are seeking the arrears of lease rent amounting Rs 41,37,927 under Section 7 of the same Act. From July 8 onwards, they won’t be able to organize races at the LRC. The Lucknow Race Fund still has time to settle all the dues till the end of this month, or else they will have to vacate the land,” informs Abhishek Mani Tripathi. (BCCL) (BCCL) And while speculation is rife whether that will mean an end to the horse racing and other events at the Lucknow Race Course, officials at the LRC say this does not affect the functioning of the Lucknow Race Course nor are the races likely to be called off. On the condition of anonymity, an official of the LRC says, ""There are two kinds of lands or leases at the LRC – one is permanent lease of which the custodian is the Lucknow Race Course and the other is the renewal lease which the DEO has served the LRF a notice of eviction for. Under the permanent lease comes the area like the racing track, conference room, front area, lawns – in short – major parts of LRC is under it. While there is an area around the race course called the 14 Furlong Area where around 45 ex-servicemen are staying, which comes under the renewal lease of the DEO. That lease, which is the talking point, was last renewed in 1978. As a custodian, we are taking care of that part of land and despite sending reminders to the concerned authorities for renewing the lease or taking it under their full control. It doesn’t become a no-man’s land if the deed is not renewed and so we have been taking care of it since. When the committee meeting will take place, all these points will be raised. The races and the LRC’s functioning will not be affected, that one can be sure of because of this land dispute."" Spread in an area of 70.22 acres, the Lucknow Race Course is the longest course in the country and the only one which has an anti-clockwise track. While the racing track, the stands, stables and the conference room, the front area and the lawns come under lease of the LRC, the rest of the adjoining area is what the DEO has asked to be vacated where the civilians are living and have their unauthorised living quarters. The history of the racecourse goes back to the 17th century when Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula constructed it in 1764. In the year 1857, the racecourse club opened for the British Army’s officers. The first Civil Service Cup held in 1880 had horses from the Arabian and Australian breed running on the tracks. The first polo match held in 1912 at the polo grounds in Cantonment was organised by the Lucknow Race Course club. The same club in 2012 started the Awadh Polo Cup and hosted the first horse polo matches in the city in decades. — Akash.Wadhwa@timesgroup.com and Saad Abbasi "

Ghaziabad,Boy drowns after falling in uncovered hole in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: A 15-year-boy cycling through a waterlogged road in Vijay Nagar fell into a drain through a gaping 8 by8 feet hole left by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation that had repaired the stretch two weeks ago. The body of Deepanshu Pal, a Class X student of St. Teresa’s Convent, was fished out after three hours of search by an NDRF team, 200 metres from the spot where he drowned. Residents of Sarvodaya Nagar said GMC had not bothered to even place a signboard near the hole to warn people against straying nearby. The civic body had created such holes in several places on the road to clean a drain flowing underneath, but had left them uncovered. A spell of afternoon rain on Saturday left the road under knee-deep water and it became impossible for anyone to spot the holes from a distance. Late on Saturday, GMC ordered a probe into the accident. The boy’s grandmother (centre) and relatives mourn the deathDeepanshu’s family members said he and his younger brother Subham, who, too, studied in the same school, would return home together on a bicycle. But on Saturday, Deepanshu asked Subham to go home alone and said he would return after sometime. The boy’s father, Ashok Pal, is an accountant with a private firm in Ghaziabad, while his mother Sonu works in the tehsil office in Dadri. His elder sister Vidhi passed Class XII this year.

It is not the road that the boys would take to come back from school. Shubham had asked Deepanshu to take the cycle with him and returned home walking along with a friend,” he said. When Deepanshu did not reach home even after 3pm, his grandfather went to the school to enquire about his whereabouts. After reaching the school, Asharam Pal was told that a boy about the same age as Deepanshu had drowned in the 12ft drain, just 500 metres away. He rushed to the spot, and saw Deepanshu’s cycle, which had been fished out by then. Till the time Asharam identified the cycle as Deepanshu’s, police were clueless about the identity of the boy. Amit Kumar, who was witness to the incident, said: “The boy had been alerted by a few kids about the broken road and the hole, but he did not take it seriously. He was wearing a yellow T-shirt and off-white trousers.” After Deepanshu fell into the overflowing drain, two passersby — Kalua and Bhairav — jumped into it and fished out the cycle.

LU authorities have directed departments to file complete reports by July 30. The reports will be analysed by the university’s Internal Quality Assessment Cell (IQAC) before drafting a self study report (SSR) and then be uploaded on the NAAC website. NAAC will then award marks after evaluating the SSR and send a team to LU for ground evaluation. The final grading will be based on points scored in SSR (80%) and ground evaluation (20%).

Though police lodged a case of murder on the Pundir family’s complaint, it has been maintaining that it appears to be an accident. “Prima facie, it appears that Pundir was high on drugs, he lost balance and fell from the balcony of his room on the second floor on the iron railing on the boundary wall of his house in Vishwas Khand,” police had said in press statement.

The postmortem report is silent on whether Pundir was intoxicated at the time of death or not since doctors could not conclude whether he was under influence of any drug at the time of death and have suggested to preserve viscera for further probe.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Two held after gunfight for BJP worker’s murder,"GHAZIABAD: Two men were arrested following a gunfight with policemen in Masuri area on Saturday night, hours after they had pumped four bullets into a BJP functionary. The two men, identified as Shahrukh (22) and Tehseem (24), carried a reward of Rs 25,000 each on their head. Around 9.30pm on Saturday, Balbir Singh Tomar, BJP’s zonal president in Dasna, was shot dead by four bike-borne men. Tomar ran a nursing home in Dhoodhiya-Peepal area and was standing near a paan shop when he was attacked. SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun told TOI that a few hours later, four policemen had set up a check-post around 1km from the spot where Tomar was shot. “The team of policemen signalled the duo to stop but they started firing at them instead. One of the policemen in the team called for reinforcements and another team reached the spot from Masuri police station. The team chased the accused and managed to nabbed them after 2km,” Jadaun said. “Shahrukh and Tahseem were arrested and the scooter they were riding was seized. The scooter belongs to Shahrukh.

The arrested duo have apparently told interrogators that four of them had surrounded Tomar and shot him with their country-made guns. “They pumped one bullet each into the BJP worker,” the officer said. According to police, Tomar’s murder was the fallout of a controversy surrounding a woman who had eloped with a man from her neighbourhood on July 4. The BJP member had apparently supported the man’s family, which angered relatives of the woman. Ghaziabad SP Sudhir Singh said: “Aman is the brother of the woman who had run away, while Salman is her cousin. As Tomar supported the man, the woman’s brother decided to kill him.” The station house officer of Masuri police station and a police post in-charge have been suspended for dereliction of duty following the murder. “It was a planned murder.

Once on Moon, lander and rover will spend 14 earth days looking for water, minerals and just about anything interesting.While Chandrayaan’s entry into the initial orbit had Isro scientists at Sriharikota lean back on their chairs, it brought around 100 scientists and engineers to the edge of their seats at the Isro Telemetry, Tracking and Command (Istrac) centre in Bengaluru. “It’ll be like this for the next 62 days (48 during the journey and 14 days after the rover touches down on Moon),” said a scientist at Istrac. Chandrayaan-2 is now under Istrac’s control, and the centre is using all its ground stations in Bengaluru, Lucknow, Mauritius, Sriharikota, Port Blair, Thiruvananthapuram, Brunei, Biak (Indonesia) and the deep space network stations which will provide tracking support.

Istrac has got control of the spacecraft, which used its onboard sensors to correct course and align itself with Sun. “We have turned on the star sensor onboard the module,” the scientist said. In between these operations, the solar panels were deployed allowing the craft to ‘sunbathe’. While solar energy is key for its survival through the journey to Moon, the other sensor does ‘star gazing’ for coordinates to ensure it goes in the right direction. “Without gazing at the stars continuously, the spacecraft won’t be able to know where it is going. The sensor puts in the satellite’s memory patterns of stars that tell it where to go,” another scientist explained. Istrac will give commands for the orbit-raising manoeuvres. After these, the team will give commands for trans-lunar injection, putting Chandrayaan in the path of Moon. “From there on, we will push it closer to Moon with multiple engine burns and insert it into the lunar orbit,” the scientist explained. Isro chairman K Sivan was reflecting the excitement when he said the final descent “fifteen minutes of terror.” If Chandrayaan-2 was launched without a glitch on July 15, it would have reached the lunar orbit in 22 days and gone around Moon for 28 days. As per the revised schedule, the module will remain in the 100km x 100km orbit for 13 days. The orbiter, which will have the lander and rover integrated, will orbit Moon before the lander with the rover inside it separates from it.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Repaired before summer, ravaged by rain","LUCKNOW: Two weeks' rain has exposed cosmetic repair of several city roads, where cracks and craters have resurfaced to threaten commuters within a few months. The nationally accepted standard is that a road constructed or repaired should last at least five years at a stretch, but a TOI survey in Aliganj, Jankipuram, Alambagh, Indiranagar, Mahanagar and Krishnanagar on Thursday revealed many that were tended to between January and March this year are either caving in or already riddled with ugly warts.  Asha Singh, a private tutor in Indiranagar, said she had complained to Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) several times, but in vain. ""This road in Sector 21 was fixed in January, but the cosmetic fillings were washed away by the first monsoon showers. My students have sustained injuries after their cycles skidded on the uneven road. The LMC is hardly hearing my pleas,"" she told TOI.  Another arterial stretch between Jankipuram Sector 1 and Madiaon, which was repaired three months ago, has started wearing off. Local residents said heavy vehicles plying on this link road to Sitapur highway was taking a toll. ""We suspect substandard construction. The stretch has become dangerous for commuters,"" said Priya Singh, a teacher. In Krishnanagar, the road near a kindergarten has developed deadly craters following waterlogging over the past week. Commuters complained that the risk of an accident increased manifold after sundown when vehicles were unable to gauge the depth of these water-filled holes. Axles can break or cars can overturn, not to mention the peril it poses to two-wheelers, they said. Let alone repaired roads, the newly built artery leading to Kathautha Chauraha in Viraj Khand, Gomtinagar, has potholes all over. Residents allege shoddy construction work for maximum profit. The substandard materials used to make the road has been unable to withstand a few spells of rain, they said.  Similar complaints are also pouring from Mahanagar, Alambagh, Sringarnagar, LDA Sector D and Chowk. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi denied the allegation of poor quality of road construction. ""We are provisionally plugging potholes and evening out roads. Once the rainy season is over, we will revamp the roads. I can assure you that there has been no neglect on the part of officials. However, we will probe if quality of construction was not up to the mark,"" he said. "

Lucknow,Was Gumnami Baba Netaji? Not sure: Report,"LUCKNOW: The Justice Vishnu Sahai Commission’s report on the mysterious ‘Gumnami Baba’, which was tabled in the UP cabinet on Tuesday, says it’s difficult to determine whether he was indeed Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, as popularly believed. The findings of the commission formed in 2016, which will now be tabled in the UP assembly, reportedly only draw parallels between Bose and the Baba. It mentions that other than literature in English, Bengali and Hindi, the three languages in which Netaji was fluent, books on Bose himself and authors he liked to read have been recovered. Sources said that the report also mentions that Gumnami Baba was also fluent in these three languages and was an influential person to whom people flocked. “As per the report, Gumnami Baba continued to stay in his Faizabad house till rumours of him being Subhash Chandra Bose surfaced, after which he left that place,” said the source. The report, prepared by Justice Vishnu Sahai, was commissioned by the SP government in 2016 on directions of Allahabad HC.

Lucknow,Not sure if Gumnami Baba was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: Report,"LUCKNOW: The Justice Vishnu Sahai Commission’s report on the mysterious ‘Gumnami Baba’, which was tabled in the UP cabinet on Tuesday, says it’s difficult to determine whether he was indeed Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, as popularly believed. The findings of the commission formed in 2016, which will now be tabled in the UP Assembly, reportedly only draw parallels between Bose and the Baba. It mentions that other than literature in English, Bengali and Hindi, the three languages in which Netaji was fluent, books on Bose himself and authors he liked to read have been recovered. Sources said that the report also mentions that Gumnami Baba was also fluent in these three languages and was an influential person to whom people flocked.

Lucknow,‘Police didn’t act against guilty in Kashi stampede’,"LUCKNOW: The state government presented the action taken report (ATR) of the stampede at Rajghat in Varanasi during a ‘shobha yatra’ (religious procession) in October 2016 in the assembly on Tuesday. The report says that police did not take action against prime accused Pankaj Maharaj of Jai Gurudev Sanstha, responsible for the death of 25 pilgrims in the stampede in October 2016 when Samajwadi Party government was in power. Jai Gurudev Santha had sought permission from district administration for taking out a ‘shobha yatra’ near Rajghat in Varanasi. As the procession reached Rajghat bridge, there was a stampede leading to death of 25 pilgrims on the spot and causing injuries to many. The report states there was a minor clash on October 15 between two bikers at Rajghat bridge causing injuries to a woman which led to a verbal dual between the two causing a traffic jam on the bridge. In the meantime, the participants of Jaigurudev yatra also arrived. While there was a jam, a train passed below the bridge causing tremors. Some pilgrims jumped off the bridge while others ran helter-skelter leading to on the spot death of 25 participants of shobha yatra and leaving scores injured. The one-man judicial commission headed by Justice (retired) Rajmani Chauhan found that the chairman of Jai Gurudev Sanstha, Pankaj Maharaj kept police and district administration in dark about the huge crowd and said only 3,000 people would join the shobha yatra. “Police had registered criminal case against Pankaj Maharaj, but one does not know why no action was taken against him. It raises a question mark over the functioning of local police,” the commission’s report said. The commission recommended that in future any claims of Jai Gurudev Sanstha for organising any such programme be strictly verified and only then be allowed. CM Yogi Adityanath signed the ATR and informed the House that the recommendations of the commission have been implemented. "
Lucknow,Lucknow cops face non-bailable warrants for botching up probe,"LUCKNOW: A lower court on Tuesday issued non-bailable warrants (NBWs) against two policemen for “failing to appear in the murder case” of Rahul Sridhar. A Class IX student of La Martiniere College, Rahul had fallen to his death from the 100ft Constantia building on the campus on April 10, 2015. The order has been issued on the complaint of Rahul’s kin who had on September 14, 2017, moved court against then Gautampalli SHO Surendra Katiyar and SI Ram Naresh Singh. The family had said the boy was murdered and insisted the two policemen, investigating the case, had tampered with evidence to pass it off as suicide. Rahul’s mother Annamma told TOI that on the day of the incident, she had written an application asking for “fair probe” into her son’s “murder”, but SHO Katiyar got another application drafted in Hindi and “forced” her to sign it. Annamma, who is from Kerala, does not read or write Hindi. The bereaved mother said the inquest details were also tampered with and witness signatures on the report forged. The procedure of performing inquest in the presence of a magistrate was not followed either. The bed linen in which Rahul’s body was brought to the mortuary was burnt while his school uniform went missing.

Ghaziabad,Green court allows Haj House in Ghaziabad to open for one month,"GHAZIABAD: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the de-sealing of Haj House in Ghaziabad for four weeks to ascertain the level of compliance of its sewage treatment plant (STP) that was installed recently.

The NGT order, which was passed on Tuesday, said: “Let the building be de-sealed for the purpose of inspecting the compliance in the light of optimum operation of the STP. Such opening will be initially for four weeks. Thereafter, in the light of the inspection report, the SPCB (UPPCB) will be at liberty to take further decision in the matter in accordance with the law.” “We had contended in NGT when he had filed a case against construction of Haj House on the ground that it was built on Hindon flood plain area and hence it be demolished,” said Raghav, the co-petitioner. “The court, however, in its subsequent order had turned down our demolition plea but had ordered officials to ensure that a STP to treat 136 KLD of waste water has been installed in the complex or not, but since it was not installed the NGT in February last year had ordered to seal it till the time STP was installed,” added Raghav. “The court now wants to ascertain the efficiency of the STP and for that it has ordered de-sealing for four weeks and in that time the officials have been asked to ascertain whether it is working to optimum capacity,” he said.

Two months later, on July 4, 1999, his regiment — the 18 Grenadiers — was ordered to recapture Tiger Hill, one of the highest peaks in the Drass-Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir. The 19-year-old Bulandshahr boy took 14 enemy bullets, accomplished the mission and survived to become the youngest recipient of the Param Vir Chakra, India’s highest military decoration. Being the son of Karan Singh Yadav, a soldier in the Kumaon Regiment who fought the 1971 Indo-Pak War, courage was already in Yogendra’s genes.

Lucknow,A day of name calling for Vidhan Parishad members,"LUCKNOW: A significant part of the first half of Wednesday’s business in Vidhan Sabha was dedicated to members calling each other names, finally prompting a BSP member and the leader of the House to demand that members be respectful towards each other. In the middle of the ruckus was rural development minister Mahendra Singh, who was caught in a similar controversy on Tuesday in the Vidhan Sabha where he got into a spat with Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary. It was after much back and forth and pleas to consider what would appear in the next day’s newspapers about them that finally prompted the members to apologise to each other. The exchange of words started when SP MLC Madhukar Jaitley was questioning the government over accidents on the Agra Expressway.

This drew shrieks of protest from SP members even as both parties continued to exchange barbs.

""It's clear the incident is not related to Muzaffarnagar riots,"" he said. Yogi said Asbab was murdered on March 11 and a case was lodged under section 302 (murder) of IPC against unidentified persons with Khatauli police station the same day.

The unaccompanied teenagers — the girls aged 15 and 16, and the boys 14 — were spotted on a train to Barabanki at Badshahnagar railway station in the city during a routine RPF check around 4am. Based on their accounts, Vijay Badri, alias Bangali, was rounded up from his den in Munshipulia. The children are being rehabilitated at a state-run shelter while police are looking for Bangali’s accomplices, said to be 3-15 in number. More minors may be in their captivity. According to the rescued boys and girls, their tormentor, who is a right foot amputee, not just forced them into illegal acts but also sedated them, slashed their bodies with a blade and smeared their blood on his bandaged leg to garner sympathy as a beggar.

The girls were allegedly forced to “please customers”, sometimes more than one at a time, for anything between Rs 150 and Rs 500.

Bangali, a native of Bengal who was picked up from his shanty in Munshipulia, has confessed to running the racket with three aides. “He took to begging after losing a foot in an accident, but soon started luring slum kids with food, clothes and money to use them for prostitution and thievery,” said RPF inspector MK Khan.

Ghaziabad,"Infant’s death: Government officer’s report indicts three doctors for negligence, medics question probe","GHAZIABAD: An inquiry conducted by the additional city magistrate into the death of a two-month-old boy at the state-run MMG Hospital on July 17 has named three doctors for negligence. Hospital sources said the doctors were unhappy with the way the inquiry was conducted and wondered how an investigation into alleged negligence could be instituted without a doctor on the panel. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, however, said the inquiry did not look at the medical aspects. “The inquiry centred around administrative lapses and it was not mandated to investigate medical lapses, which was obviously not the case here,” Pandey said. On July 17, Masuri resident Mohammad Irshad had brought his son to MMG hospital after the child had respiratory problems. “My wife and I were directed to the OPD (outpatient department) of the hospital from the women’s hospital, where we had initially gone. After I reached there, I was told to get the OPD slip,” Irshad said, adding even as he stood in queue, the boy’s condition deteriorated and his skin began turning blue. He claimed he rushed to the OPD in Ward No. 15 where a “doctor” told him to get the slip first. “By that time, my son was gasping for breath and before we could take him to the emergency ward, he passed away,” Irshad said.

I only looked into the sequence of events that led to such an unfortunate incident and what I concluded was that the child was not entertained at the right time because the child’s mother, in her statement, said they were made to get OPD slips even though his condition was worsening,” he added. The doctors are disappointed by the report. “In the OPD, it’s a practice to get a slip first,” said NK Gupta, chief medical officer, adding serious patients are treated in the emergency section and can go there directly. “In this case, the patient’s family had come to the OPD. Had they come to the emergency ward, the child would have been automatically taken care of,” added Gupta. Another senior doctor at the hospital said none of three doctors implicated in the report had asked the child’s parents to get the OPD slip. “The parents never approached the three doctors who were on duty at the time because, after checking their log book, they together attended to 208 patients that day. The child’s name did not figure in the log book,” said Dr Ravinder Rana, chief medical superintendent at the hospital. “The allegations made by the child’s parents that a doctor turned them away is not correct. It’s quite possible that whosoever asked them to get the OPD slip may have been an attendant of a patient or someone else who the child’s parents mistook for a doctor,” Rana added. The report will now be submitted to the DM, who in turn can forward his recommendations to the health department for action against the doctors. "

This has been planned to make educational institutes accessible to differently abled children, keeping in mind their population in the state. The state government has also decided to start 12 new “inclusive” schools where disabled children will study along with others to address the psychological issues of differently abled children. Four of these schools will begin functioning from the next academic session.

Ghaziabad,"Properties not selling, GDA considers slashing rates","GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) is considering waiving or reducing supervisory and administrative charges on properties that it offers for sale. The agency has been forced to think of sweeteners because GDA properties have failed to attract buyers for some time now. “A committee was formed under the GDA secretary to find the reasons why our properties were not finding buyers in auctions,” said Kanchan Verma, vice-chairperson, GDA. SkipIt was found that in comparison with private developers, GDA levies supervisory and administrative charges that together amounts to 30% of the total cost of property. “For the sake of attracting buyers, we’ll either forgo supervisory and administrative charges completely or will slash it because, on both heads, GDA charges 15% of total cost of property,” said Verma. GDA has housing units in Indirapuram, Swarnjayantipuram, Vaishali, Nandgram, Indraprasth and Madhuban Bapudham. In these areas, if a GDA property — say a 2BHK flat — costs Rs 30 lakh, inclusive of supervisory and administrative charges, the price charged by a private developer would be around Rs 25 lakh. Cumulatively, GDA properties worth about Rs 500 crore have gone unsold in auctions.

There are at least 60 such shops in Indirapuram and Raj Nagar District Centre which have gone unsold. Verma also said property rates were not in consonance with circle rates, which are almost double, in some areas. “The circle rates in some areas for the last 11 years has remained high which is the reason why we have failed to attract buyers so we plan to bring parity in the rates,” said Verma.

The civic body has now asked police to act against the offenders. Deepanshu Pal, a resident of Shivpuri, was cycling through a waterlogged road in Sarvodaya Nagar last Saturday (July 20) when he fell into the drain through a gaping 8 by 8 feet hole left by GMC that had repaired the stretch two weeks ago. The Class X student’s body was fished out after three hours of search, 200 metres from the spot where he drowned. Officials said the GMC has now written a letter to the local police to initiate action against the dairy owners for violating directives of the National Green Tribunal by dumping waste in the drain. Moreover, zonal officers have been directed to impose a penalty of Rs 50,000 on each of the offenders under the UP plastic and garbage (regulation) act. As a part of the probe, the committee, headed by GMC additional commissioner Shivpujan Yadav, had recorded statements of local residents, who blamed dairy owners for encroaching upon the drain. Notably, it did not find any negligence on the part of GMC even though residents blamed the agency for not placing a signboard near the hole.

Lucknow,Sloth bear surprise for experts in Mirzapur forests,"LUCKNOW: It was a delightful surprise for wildlife enthusiasts after a camera trap survey found the presence of sloth bears in Mirzapur forest division, a discovery that exceeded their expectations. The first-of-its-kind camera trap survey was done by an environment and wildlife research foundation based in the region. The sloth bear is endemic to the Indian subcontinent and is protected under Schedule (I) of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. This means the bear has absolute protection and any offence will invite the highest penalty.

Many of these were protected animals not recorded in Mirzapur before this. These included leopard, Asiatic wild cat, rusty spotted cat, Indian wolf, Indian gazelle, blackbuck, peafowl, Bengal monitor lizard and mugger crocodile. Other important species recorded were striped hyena, jungle cat, red fox, golden jackal, ruddy mongoose and red jungle fowl.The survey was done from May to July in 2018. Now, the group has proposed to the forest department that a conservation reserve for sloth bear be declared in Mirzapur. “We have submitted our report, which we published this month, to the state forest and wildlife department. Through our report we also propose a conservation reserve in Mirzapur for sloth bear,” said Debadityo Sinha, one of the lead authors. The report has been co-authored by DFO, Mirzapur, Rakesh Chaudhary. The camera trap survey was done mainly in four of the eight ranges of Mirzapur forest division: Marihan, Sukrit, Chunar and some parts of Lalganj. “We are proposing the conservation reserve in these ranges. The total area of the reserve is about 408 sq km,” said Sinha. The National Bear Conservation and Welfare Action Plan, published by the Union ministry of environment and forests in 2012, has already recognized Mirzapur forest division as an important sloth bear habitat. The report highlighted a threat to the species because of mining and increasing anthropogenic pressures. It also showed the sloth bear population to be declining in the region. Wildlife census by the state forest department from time to time confirms the same. Wildlife estimates for 2011 and 2013 showed at least 46% decline. “Many of these animals are elusive and nocturnal. They may not have been recorded in the census because of their nature and behaviour,” said Sinha. "
Lucknow,When women took centre stage in Lucknow,"A play titled Ghazab Teri Adaa was recently staged at Bhartendu Natya Akademi. The play, written and directed by Prof Waman Kendre was inspired by the Aristophanes’ play Lysistrata in which women were shown opposing the war. The thought of doing this play came several times in the director’s mind in the last 32 years, but it only remained an aspiration for him. The recent global scenario of multiple wars though did not affect him directly, this insensitivity saddened him greatly.

Lucknow,"Dengue patient count 10 in July, Lucknow civic body takes a nap","LUCKNOW: Dengue has started taking the city in its grip this monsoon, but the civic body seems to be waiting for it to turn into a health crisis. The city has reported 10 dengue cases in July. However, fogging by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) is yet to pick up pace. Though officials claimed to have covered all eight zones in the past week, a TOI reality check found mosquito breeding grounds at many places. Residents also countered LMC's claims, saying no anti-mosquito drive had taken place so far. TimesViewLucknow Municipal Corporation needs to realise that prevention is better than cure. Rather than waiting for outbreak of the vector-borne disease, the civic body should proactively check mosquito population from rising by ensuring regular anti-larvae spray and fogging across the city. Senior officials should also take feedback from the residents to find out whether the plan to check mosquito menace is being executed properly or not.The civic committee, constituted on HC order after the dengue outbreak in 2016, had asked LMC to complete fogging of the entire city before monsoon.

The GDA says if both the RWAs agree, then it is also ready to construct new towers on the model of Tulsi Niketan. “The retro-fitting cost of each towers have been estimated at Rs 3.5 crore and we have suggested that the two RWAs and GDA bear the cost proportionately,” said VN Singh, chief engineer, GDA. “If this proposal is not accepted to RWAs, then we have suggested ‘Tulsi Niketan’ model under which that the two apartment buildings will be handed over to private builders who in turn will construct new ones after demolishing them, and in the intervening time, the occupants will be shifted elsewhere only to return after construction,” he added. GDA’s proposals, however, has found no takers in the two RWAs.

Lucknow,"Government allows farm land lease for solar power plant, agriculture industry","LUCKNOW: In a major push to boost investment and production as well as setting up of solar power projects in the state ahead of the ground breaking ceremony on Sunday, the UP government has made it possible to lease out agricultural land, so far prohibited, for agricultural purpose or for setting up solar plants. The new law permits lease of agricultural land for agricultural purposes for up to 15 years and for a solar project for up to 30 years. SkipThe change in rules will be highly beneficial for Bundelkhand where acres of land has been lying fallow as leasing was not permitted, said an official.

The UP Revenue Code (Amendment) Bill, 2019, which has replaced an ordinance, was cleared by both Houses on Friday. The Bill could not be tabled in last Assembly session for some reason and had lapsed, forcing the government to bring an ordinance on March 10, 2019, an official said. The bill also eases the process of converting agricultural land to non-agricultural vide an amendment to section 80 which deals with land use conversion and has introduced a regularisation penalty in case someone purchases more than 12.5 acre agricultural land without prior permission from government. Till now, banks did not finance projects if the land use wasn’t changed while the revenue department refused to allow change of land use till work started. The amendment will allow application for land use change with minimum work carried out at the site. The other key development is introduction of a 5% regularisation penalty for purchase of more than 12.5 acre agricultural land for non-agricultural use. One cannot hold more than 12.5 acre land for agricultural purposes. "

Lucknow,Sidharth Malhotra and Parineeti Chopra’s food trail in Lucknow,"Itishree.Misra@timesgroup.com  and Akash.Wadhwa@timesgroup.com A complete foodie at heart, actress Parineeti Chopra, who was in Lucknow on Saturday to promote her latest film with co-actor Sidharth Malhotra, had to literally control herself to not eat too much. When the two in fact, sat down for an exclusive tasting, arranged by Lucknow Times, of the several dishes prepared with famous Lakhnawi Dussehri mangoes, they did not waste time in tasting the wonderful dishes even while lamenting that their calorie count for the day was going for a toss. “It looks like a mango fest, what is this!” exclaimed Parineeti while eyeing the mango dishes. “So I am actually going to eat each and every dish made of mango! Seeing all these dishes only makes me so happy. Itne dinon se grilled veggies jo main kha rahi hoon, I actually want to try all these dishes. This mango drink looks like a martini...so cool. It is party time for us!” she said excitedly while Sidharth wanted to know all about the dishes and what they were and bombarded the hotel chef to tell him about them. “This spread looks amazing. Main toh aaj aam jaisa lag bhi raha hoon. But seriously, we shot in Malihabad but couldn’t have magoes then, thankfully ab khane ko mila gaya hai.” Having lost oodles of weight, Parineeti says she now doesn’t obsess over food as much as she used to. “I used to be a complete foodie but not any more. I eyed the food laid here and then I moved on. I think this comes with growing up. Most of my life I have actually not given my health or my body the respect that I should have. And I think that was one weakness that I needed to work on the most. Today I respect myself and fitness much more. Yes, you should have a cheat day but the lifestyle change should also come. Earlier I used to only look at taste, but now I look at tasty and healthy options. The wake up call for me was when I didn’t have the stamina to even shoot for four hours. I really became unhealthy.

Ask her about the experience of shooting in the city so many times and she says, “I have such a huge sense of familiarity now with this city. My first ever solo film, Ishaqzaade was shot here. So obviously that instant bonding happens with the people and the place that you shoot at. To come back to Lucknow for Dawat-e-Ishq and then coming back again for Jabariya Jodi, has made Lucknow the Indian city which I have traveled to the most. After Mumbai, this is my most favourite city. There is a reason why so many films are being shot in Lucknow, because it is really-really Bollywood friendly. It really supports film shootings and so we actors also love coming back here. Even if we are shooting outdoors in Lucknow, we are fine because the crowd is always in control. I always know now that shooting in Lucknow is going to be a good experience. Even food wise, every time I come to Lucknow to shoot or to promote my film, I enjoy a lot of good Lakhnawi food.” Sidharth and Parineeti also feasted on baati-chokha in Lucknow (BCCL/ Pics: Aditya Yadav) Sidharth and Parineeti also feasted on baati-chokha in Lucknow (BCCL/ Pics: Aditya Yadav) For Siddharth, however, it was his first experience of shooting a film here. “It was my first time in shooting here and Lucknow gives you such a lovely texture of heartland India. We had shot for the film in different parts of the city and on different streets. So we pretty much utilised every part of the city in our film even though Jabariya Jodi is based in Patna. But because our producers found it very easy to shoot here, we shot in this city. And there are so many films being shot here. With this speed Lucknow will soon become the new Mumbai,” shared Sidharth.

So after pack-up, I used to go out and roam around Lucknow. I have visited the Bada and Chhota Imambara, the malls, I used to go to Rumi Gate and have ice creams, I would just do all those normal things as a regular tourist. I have such amazing memories and pictures of that time. But now everything has changed. We are talking about all this seven years later. I have not really experienced Lucknow like that again. Now it is always going out in Lucknow as an actor with the security. I also remember shooting a lot in Residency where the people who work there knew me because we have spent so much time together,” she says, adding, “Lucknow is a really modern yet old city. It still has proof of all the Indian culture that was once there. The beautiful Indian monuments are still standing. It is amazing to see a city like Lucknow which has a blend of both the worlds.” Having shot three films in the city, Parineeti rues that she hasn’t got to play a proper Lakhnawi girl. “In Ishaqzaade, I never got to play a proper Lucknowite as it was a very modern character with a different accent, in Dawat-e-Ishq, I had a Hyderabadi accent, and in Jabariya..., I play a Bihari, so now I really wish to play a Lucknowite with a proper accent of this city.” Sidharth Malhotra in Lucknow (BCCL/ Pics: Aditya Yadav) Sidharth Malhotra in Lucknow (BCCL/ Pics: Aditya Yadav) Even Sidharth wishes to come back to the city soon. “Kudos to the state government for making Lucknow so shoot friendly.

I’m really happy that we shot here in Lucknow. I missed Lucknow when I got back to Mumbai,” he adds. Several girl fans of Sidhrath came to meet him and also brought him gifts (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)  The two shares that they have encountered several fan moments while shooting in Lucknow. “I remember how several fans used to wait outside our hotel for days till we met them as we used to leave for the shoot early in the morning and come back late in the night,” shares Parineeti, adding, “They would always try to catch us out side the hotel. So when one day, I wasn’t shooting while Sid was, I made it a point to meet them and sit with them for sometime. Lucknow fans showered us with so much of love,” smiles Parineeti, while Sidharth agrees with her. “I remember when we were shooting here there was this group of girls from the city who brought me a cake and had made collage of my pics. As an actor, that’s what you want. People’s love and appreciation and that we got a lot of from the people of Lucknow. Later, the actors visited a restaurant to have baati-chokha, the famous Eastern UP and Bihari dish. “This is so yum!” said Parineeti as she helped herself to one while Sidharth remembered how he had the dish when he bgean shooting for the film. “That was the first time in my life I had had litti-chokha and I had loved it then.” The two actors then met a few fans and had pictures clicked with them. Leaving behind and taking some good memories from Lucknow both Parineeti and Sidharth hoped that they would be back in Lucknow soon. — Itishree.Misra@timesgroup.com and Akash.Wadhwa@timesgroup.com "
Kanpur,Communal violence: Eminent persons must strive for harmony before writing letters,"In the first war of independence, or sepoy mutiny of 1857, Hindus and Muslims fought shoulder to shoulder against colonial forces. In the next 90 years, undivided India witnessed growing hostilities between Hindu and Muslim communities. It got bloodier after the 1920s. Communal riots in Nagpur and Mumbai in 1927-29 saw mobs lynch innocents. Communal lynching took a grotesque dimension in 1946. Muslim League's Direct Action Day state-sponsored lynching in Calcutta in August-September, followed by the bloody Noakhali carnage in October-November and a retaliation in Bihar. Over 15,000 people were lynched in these three incidents. The worst was reserved for 1947 when vivisection of the country resulted in displacement of 15 million. Frenzied communal mobs lynched a million, scars of which never healed. Since independence, both communities seldom spared an opportunity to bait, berate and engage in violence against each other at the slightest provocation, at the behest of intellectuals or preachers. Uttar Pradesh has historically been the country's communal cauldron. Intellectuals, who are worried by a spike in communal violence and intolerance today, must read Allahabad High Court's judgment in Mohd Ishaq Ilmi [AIR 1957 All 782]. It narrates how intolerance had already taken root even when the nation was in its infancy. Similar incidents continue to spark violence and further weaken the social fabric. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Ilmi was the printer, publisher and editor of Urdu daily 'Siyasat' in Kanpur when Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan, headed by K M Munshi, who was also then governor of UP, re-published a book written by two American authors titled 'Religious Leaders' in May 1956. It had ""objectionable and provocative"" passages on Prophet Muhammad. Ilmi started a religion-coated campaign against the book and continued with it even after Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan withdrew the book from circulation and Munshi published regret in newspapers. Continuous incitement by Ilmi's 'Siyasat' incensed Aligarh Muslim University students to hold demonstrations and shout slogans like ""Hans ke liya Pakistan, Lar ke Lenge Hindustan' and 'Pakistan Zindabad'. Hindu students took out a protest march against such demonstration by Muslims. The protest march was attacked and a prominent Hindu was stabbed to death. Ilmi was taken into preventive custody to stop him from promoting communal hatred. The present 'Jai Sri Ram' chant appears to have taken a leaf out of Ilmi's Siyasat. Though the HC quashed Ilmi's preventive detention after putting a premium on his free speech and said he did not incite violence, it made a general statement, ""It is a notorious fact of which we are justified in taking judicial notice that in cases where communal feelings have been exploited and communal frenzy has been worked up, violence has invariably resulted sooner or later whether such violence was advocated or not."" These words still hold good for India and for intellectuals, who only look at the result and not the provocations over the years. Provocative statements leading to violence and counter-violence have become a way of life in India and part of right to free speech. Comments by the American authors about the Prophet led to communal violence in many places in UP in 1956. Salman Rushdie's 'Satanic Verses' got banned by the government to placate Muslims without caring for the author's free speech. When MF Hussain painted a nude woman, as a mimic of India's shape, and it was christened 'Bharat Mata', it catered to the secular thoughts of elites and evoked inviolability of right to free speech in judicial minds. Hussain fled India fearing reprisal. The SC came to his rescue on September 7, 2008, and termed the painting a ""work of art"". It had said, ""Paintings are like a sculptures. None gets scandalised by looking at erotic sculptures."" Can anyone explain the difference between the three cases - Ilmi, Rushdie and Hussain? A commoner, whose passion get easily aroused through provocative statements, will never understand. In Masood Alam [1973 AIR 897], the SC dealt with a case of a Muslim theologist who went to Pakistan in 1971 and returned home three days before the India-Pakistan war to launch a campaign against Aligarh Muslim University Bill and set up 'Youth Majlis' for training youth to use knives. Upholding his preventive detention, the SC had said, ""It has to be borne in mind that when a person professing to be learned in religious theology encourages defiance of law in the name of religion, then ignorant and credulous people are more likely to be misled and swayed by religious passions and sentiments. Such activities naturally have greater potentiality for prejudicially threatening maintenance of public order."" The SC has mostly blamed governments for the communal situation remaining in a state of boil. While dealing with the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, the SC in Mohd Haroon case [2014 (5) SCC 252] narrated how eve-teasing of girls of one community led to violence and counter-violence. Top CommentWith names like Unity, Peace these ""intellectuals"" have lobbied for the Nehru-Gandhi Dynasty since Independence. Fooled the Nation by pretending to fight for just causes all the time strent...Read MoreKrishan Kumar TotlaniSee All CommentsAdd commentIt had said, ""Had central and state intelligence agencies smelt these problems in advance and alerted the district administration, the unfortunate incidents could have been prevented. Thus, we hold the state government responsible for being negligent at initial stages in not anticipating the communal violence and for not taking necessary steps for its prevention."" Did any intellectual blame the then SP government headed by Akhilesh Yadav? In Tehseen S Poonawala judgment [2018 (6) SCC 72], the SC said, ""There can be no shadow of doubt that the authorities which are conferred with the responsibility to maintain law and order in the states have the principal obligation to see that vigilantism, be it cow vigilantism or any other vigilantism of any perception, does not take place. When any core group with some kind of idea take the law into their own hands, it ushers in anarchy, chaos, disorder and, eventually, there is an emergency of a violent society."" So, when 49 eminent persons, settled in various parts of India, seamlessly coordinate to produce a common letter conveying to the PM their fears over rising intolerance, a commoner would have expected them to make similar coordinated efforts to promote communal harmony. The same applies to the 62 other eminent people who authored a counter-letter. It is for all of us, especially those who make a lot of noise on social media on tolerance, to travel to the nooks and corners of the country and spread harmony to dispel hatred. "

Lucknow,UP beat Gujarat in turning MoUs to projects: Amit Shah,"LUCKNOW: Union home minister and BJP chief Amit Shah hailed UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath as an able administrator, who eliminated politicization of bureaucracy that marred development of country’s most populous states before BJP came to power in 2017. He also said the road to turn India’s $5 trillion economy passes through UP.“UP ke andar prashashan ka rajneetikaran itna zyada hua tha ki pardarshita kahin door dur tak nahi thi. Focus hi prashashan tha. Prashashan rajnetaon ko khush karne mein laga rehta tha...Main kisi ka naam nahi lena chahta (There was no transparency due to politicization of bureaucracy. Focus was on administration which was busy keeping politicians in good humour. I won’t take anyone’s name),” said Shah, while speaking at the second groundbreaking ceremony of 250 projects of Rs 65,000 crore. Shah said the Yogi government has turned bureaucrats into ‘janta ke sewak’ (helper of people), rather than ‘rajnetaon ke sewak’ (helpers of politicians). SkipShah said Yogi Adityanath has improved law and order situation, which was the biggest hurdle in investments in the state. “It’s not until law and order is improved that investments would come,” he said. He said before the 2022 assembly election, UP would become the No.1 state in the country in terms of infrastructure and development. “I can guarantee the state government’s focus has been on a host of sectors, particularly small-scale industries,” he said. “I come from Gujarat which has been holding investors’ summits successfully. But the speed with which UP government has grounded investment pledges has surprised me,” Shah told the host of industry captains. Shah said the Centre has set an aim of turning India into a $5 trillion economy, for which UP will have to play a crucial role.

A relative of the Unnao rape survivor told TOI, they had sent 35 written complaints to police and administration since July 2018, expressing fear of being targeted by Sengar’s henchmen. Police had dismissed all complaints as ‘unfounded’ and ‘lacking merit’. A relative of rape survivor told TOI, “We have been living in fear and continued facing threats to life ever since CBI took over the case and arrested the MLA. There was so much pressure and fear that we even left our house in Makhi, Unnao.” “We sent written applications through registered post, and even complained on the Integrated Grievance Redressal System (IGRS) portal of government,” he added.

Lucknow,"After 16 years, is it finally homecoming for Sanjay Sinh?","LUCKNOW: Since the beginning of his political career, Sanjay Sinh has been no stranger to headlines. From being a confidant of Sanjay Gandhi in the Congress in the early 1980s to contesting against Rajiv Gandhi a few years later (Janata Dal) and then moving to the BJP to contest against Sonia Gandhi in 1999, Sinh has travelled many paths. After attacking the Congress in many forms and being away for years, he returned to the party in 2003 and went on to win the Sultanpur Lok Sabha seat in 2009. Seen as an asset in Amethi—Rahul Gandhi’s constituency till this election—Sinh said he quit because the party lacked leadership. After 16 years, he said he will now return to the BJP. His wife Ameeta also quit the Congress party with him, where she was an office-bearer.

Both Sinh and Ameeta faced charges in the 1987 murder case of ace badminton player Syed Modi, who Ameeta was married to. Though the charges were dropped after a few years and Sinh married Ameeta, Garima had challenged the legitimacy of the marriage. Meanwhile in Amethi, though Congress leadership maintained a stoic silence, Sanjay Sinh’s exit from the party is being debated by Congressmen. Top CommentMurderer.. KamalSee All CommentsAdd comment“Sanjay was the party’s go-to man in Amethi. His exit comes at a time when the party is already battling for survival in a Congress fortress. The burden of Rahul’s humiliating defeat has been furthered by this,” said a senior leader in Amethi. A young spokesperson, meanwhile, said: “Sinh could not save his bastion (Sultanpur) and lost to Maneka Gandhi this time. His contribution can be gauged from Rahul’s loss, party’s poor show in local bodies and Vidhan Sabha elections.” "
Ghaziabad,GDA to start slapping fines as roadside parking blocks lanes,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) will soon carry out inspections at housing societies and residential buildings that are using parking spaces to run commercial activities, resulting in vehicles meant to be inside the premises being parked on the road. Roadside parking has for years been a major problem in places like Indirapuram - whose administration GDA is in charge of - and leads to traffic jams on even its wide internal roads in the morning and evening rush hours as well as during weekends when traffic flow is higher. In several areas, like the road leading to Kala Patthar, roadside parking has permanently shaved off a lane, restricting traffic to a single file. Senior GDA officials said adequate parking area had been assigned in building plans. ""Earlier, every plotted area was allotted a minimum of 112 square metres of stilt parking along with three floors above this. In 2015, the building bylaws were amended after which the lower limit for stilt parking was increased to 150sqm,"" said Kanchan Verma, vice-chairperson, GDA. ""This was to ensure residents get more parking space. But this measure doesn't appear to have been effective, primarily because developers have used the stilt parking space to set up commercial establishments,"" she added. The inspections will be followed by fines. ""After the survey to ascertain the extent of violations, the enforcement wing of GDA will be asked to penalise violators and put an end to the practice,"" said Verma. The areas which the GDA has identified for the survey include Indirapuram, Vaishali, Rajendra Nagar, Shalimar Garden and parts of Sahibabad. ""After a detailed inspection, we found the problem is most prevalent on Kala Patthar road, SRS Cinemas road and Swarna Jayanti Park road,"" said Verma.

Illegal street parking blocks space equivalent to that of 450 cars at any given point in time on Kala Patthar road alone, according to the survey report. Along SRS Cinemas, that number is 287 while on Swarna Jayanti Park road and CISF Road, it is around 128. The CRRI had suggested construction of multi-level parking lots in the area and recommended penalties to be charged from defaulters to deter this problem. "
