Lucknow,Unnao rape survivor accident case: The loneliness of a ‘victim family’,"UNNAO: The jailed uncle of the Unnao rape survivor cremated his wife on the banks of the Ganga in their village on Wednesday, his forlorn figure and despairing voice mirroring the plight of a family left to fight its battles alone after losing three members in the span of just over a year. “Kuldeep Singh Sengar (the rape-accused BJP MLA) mera poora parivar kha gaya, sirf hum hee reh gaye (Kuldeep destroyed my entire family, only I have remained),” he said, ringed by cops and watched from a distance by fear-struck villagers unwilling to have anything to do with the family. An eerie silence had descended on the village, occasionally broken by the sirens of a 10-strong fleet of police vehicles, when the body of the rape survivor’s aunt arrived from Lucknow, three days after she and another relative were killed in a truck-car crash on NH-31 that also left the girl and her lawyer critically injured. In the past two years since the rape survivor named Sengar as the accused, nobody in the village had stood by the family. 'Will try to do something constructive': SC to take up Unnao rape survivor's letterEven their immediate neighbours turned into bystanders as the girl’s uncle carried out the cremation rituals. Kids passing by stared from far, perhaps unable to comprehend what was going on. “We don’t belong to this neighbourhood. We came here only to find out what this commotion is all about,” said Ram Khilawal, a resident of the village. “We don’t even pass through this side of the village. We take the other way for entry and exit, lest we be seen as supporting that family,” another said. Perched on the edge of a mud porch, one among a row of men smoking bidis said he did not want to comment on what the rape survivor’s family had gone through. “We were not there on the highway to say if it was an accident or not. What should one say anyway? Everyone knows about everything going on here. It’s just that we don’t meddle.” CBI names Kuldeep Singh Sengar, UP minister’s kin in Unnao rape survivor accident caseThe survivor’s uncle said he had written several times to the authorities of Rae Bareli jail, saying he feared for his life there. Currently serving time in an attempt-to-murder case dating back to 2000, he wasn’t convicted until July 2 this year. He has sought a transfer to Unnao jail, citing threats by the henchmen of MLA Sengar in Rae Bareli. Rae Bareli jail superintendent R N Pandey told TOI that he was unaware of any letter written by the rape survivor’s uncle. "

Lucknow,Hazratganj shooting: A father hopes for justice after six years,"LUCKNOW: Tuesday’s Hazratganj shooting may have sent shockwaves through the city, but it has revived hopes of a father seeking justice for his dead son for six years now. Ved Prakash, then 28, died of gunshot injuries received in a clash during a religious procession in Wazirganj on January 16, 2013. Shahid Jafri, one of the victims in the Hazratganj shooting, is one of the five accused who has been dodging arrest since. Ved’s father Ashok Singh Yadav believes police can now arrest Shahid and based on his statement, nab the others. “My son was the breadwinner. He was killed. The government formed an SIT. After three years of probe, it identified five accused including Shahid Jafri. However, they were never arrested,” Yadav said. In 2018, a court had declared them absconders and ordered attachment of properties, but the same too was not implemented, the father said. In June last year, the state government transferred the probe to CB-CID, as the wife of one of the accused expressed doubts over the SIT probe. Yadav challenged the decision in high court, which in March this year, directed the state to hand over the probe back to the SIT. The latter endorsed its previous report. In June this year, the court once again declared the accused absconders. “Earlier, police had the excuse that they could not trace the accused. I hope they will arrest him (Shahid) now,” the father said. "

Lucknow,"Unnao rape case: Bystanders many, but none by their side in Maakhi village","MAAKHI (UNNAO): Elderly men peered over shoulders to catch a glimpse of the dead body that had just been placed on the floor outside the rape survivor's house here on Wednesday. ""Yahan bas vyapaar hai, vyavhaar nahi (People here are too scared to interact with us),"" said mother of the rape survivor. The body of the rape survivor's aunt, who died in an accident while the car she was travelling in along the victim and their family lawyer met with an accident on Sunday, had been brought from Lucknow. It was an unusual Wednesday morning for Thoka Sarai in Maakhi village.

Ostracized by villagers in the past two years, on Wednesday, the rape survivor's kin had many a by-stander but not enough neighbours standing with them in their hour of grief, when the family returned home briefly for last rites of the survivor's aunt. As men stood in semi-circles outside the survivor's house, barely 50 steps away from that of accused legislator, Kuldeep Singh Sengar, no woman from the village, except those who were part of the family and extended family, was part of the audience. Several others hung precariously from the doors and windows of their homes. Children stopped midway their passage to school, not fully understanding what was going on. Scared to lend a hand to the family, the villagers stood as mute spectators who when asked if they belonged to the village, replied in an affirmation, but on any further questions, changed their stance. ""We don't belong from here. We only came here because of all this commotion,"" said one villager, Ram Khilawal. Another added, ""We don't even pass through this side of the village and take the other way for entry and exit, mostly because of force.""

""Ever since the CBI took vidhayakji (MLA Sengar) into custody, their family has moved out of the house too. Sometimes, a family member comes briefly but they don't stay here any longer,"" said Jai Kishan, a farmer. "

If we have to protest, we can do so against common criminals. But if the criminal is a politician or a biggie, how do we protest against them?""

We told her that if there is any incident affecting her personally, we would extend all help."" When TOI contacted the family, the girl's mother said, ""Our little girl felt safe in front of the police so she asked the question. We, as a family, have all faith in our constitution, in the police and in the government that any crime anywhere in India will be enacted upon by the system in its right sense.""

The SG and the CBI joint director gave a report on the line of investigation undertaken in the truck accident case, in which two of the survivor's aunts were killed and she and her lawyer were critically injured. Both the survivor and lawyer are on ventilator support at KGMC. The SG told the court that the CBI would take three months to complete the investigation. The bench said, ""We will give you seven days and you will be required to file a chargesheet before the same court in Delhi where the other cases are being shifted."" Later, the bench relented and said that though it would like the CBI to complete the probe in seven days, it would put an outer limit of 14 days for completion of probe and filing of chargesheet. "
Lucknow,"Another held for sedition in Aashiana, four detained","LUCKNOW: A youth was arrested and four others were detained for questioning on Thursday in the Aashiana sedition case in which 60 persons of Salehnagar village were booked for allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans during a clash. A section of villagers, however, denied having heard any seditious slogans in the area and said they had been living peacefully for over two decades. Taslim (19) was arrested in the wee hours from Ruchi Khand, said Vishwajeet Singh, station house officer of Aashiana. He was part of the mob which allegedly raised the slogans. This was the second arrest in the case. Key accused Shariq (28) was arrested on Wednesday. The incident occurred on Tuesday night when a minor dispute over the use of a modified silencer snowballed into a communal clash between two groups hailing from Ruchi Khand and adjoining Salehnagar respectively.  Shashank Gahlot, with the support of Bajrang Dal leaders, lodged an FIR against 60 people—10 named and 50 unidentified—accusing them of rioting and raising pro-Pakistan slogans. All the accused have fled their homes, leaving behind women and children. Police have not recorded statements of the families of the accused, but detained four for questioning. “We have been living here for decades but no anti-national activity or clash took place. Any minor disputes were resolved amicably,” said Shekhar Chaudhary (40). Sheetla Bux Singh (79), said, “What happened was just an ego clash which snowballed due to interference of some outsiders.” "
Ghaziabad,"Five Ghaziabad cops harass couple in car, suspended","GHAZIABAD: While most give in to police excesses, this couple stood up against it. Five policemen were suspended for allegedly seeking Rs 20,000 from two college students who were sitting inside a car at the near-empty parking of the Ghaziabad Habitat Centre on July 22. The girl, while being harassed by a constable who sat inside the vehicle and threatened to take them to the police station, had taken a picture on her mobile phone and shared it on Twitter a few days ago along with a narrative of the moral policing. They, however, removed the post later, possibly fearing backlash. But the post had by then attracted the attention of the DGP’s office. Sources said the state police chief had directed Ghaziabad SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh to conduct an inquiry into the allegation. On Thursday, Singh ordered the suspension of head constables Surendra Singh and Keshav Ram, and constables Amit Kumar, Somesh and Amit Mishra. All of them were posted at Niti Khand police outpost. Around 6.30pm on July 22, the two students were sitting inside a car at the parking lot when a constable on the patrol approached them. “He called his colleagues and started harassing the couple. The cops threatened to take them to the police station, and told them they would have to pay Rs 20,000 if they did not want to be implicated. Looking at the gravity of the allegation, I immediately ordered an inquiry and suspended the five cops after they were indeed found involved,” Singh said. Sources said the constable who first spotted the two students sat on the front seat of the car and asked them to “reach a deal”. “Both of them are college students. While the girl lives in Indirapuram, the boy is a resident of Delhi,” a source said. During the alleged harassment, the girl had taken a picture of the cop on her phone, which they shared on Twitter a few days later. Singh clarified that the couple eventually did not have to pay any money to the cops. In the past couple of weeks, several policemen have either been sent to the Police Lines or suspended for alleged involvement in corruption and misdemeanour cases. A sub-inspector posted at Modinagar police station was suspended for allegedly molesting a woman constable on July 22. Around the same time, an SHO, a sub-inspector and a chowki in-charge were sent to the police lines on corruption charges. The three officers accused of corruption were Sanjay Pandey, the SHO of Loni police station, Sachin Kumar Tomar, a sub-inspector at Shipra Suncity police chowki, and Anirudh Kumar, chowki in-charge of Nehru Nagar. On Wednesday, two sub-inspectors from Muradnagar police station were suspended after an audio clip, in which a liquor smuggler can be purportedly heard discussing monetary transactions with them, went viral. The two cops were Vipin Kumar and Deepak Kumar. "

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Cows squat on railway tracks, accident averted","LUCKNOW: Alert loco pilots averted accidents at Charbagh railway station on Thursday when a dozen cows came on the tracks in front of two trains—Rajdhani Express and Kamakhya-Gandhidham Express. The incident occurred around 5pm. Rajdhani Express was approaching the railway station slowly, when suddenly around 15 cows came in front of the train. The loco pilot applied emergency brakes and stopped the train just a few meters before the herd of cows. After 30 minutes, as Kamakhya-Gandhidham Express departed from Charbagh railway station, the loco pilot had to stop the train for 10 minutes and wait for the cows to move out. Railways employees said the cows come from nearby dairies on tracks daily to graze on grass and garbage near RRI building. TOI also found dogs along with cows feeding on heaps of garbage. Animal carcasses were also found around the building. Senior divisional commercial manager of Northern Railway in Lucknow Jagtosh Shukla said that a private company has been given a contract to clean the area. The train runs at a speed of 5km per hour at the time of entry into and leaving the station, hence possibilities of accidents are less, he added. "
Lucknow,Unnao rape case: Girl’s lawyer wanted gun licence plea expedited,"LUCKNOW: Barely two weeks before the car crash in Rae Bareli in which the Unnao rape survivor and her lawyer Mahendra Singh were critically injured, the latter had written to the Unnao district administration to expedite his application for a gun licence. Singh cited threat to his life because he was fighting the legal battle against the jailed MLA and prime accused, Kuldeep Singh Sengar. The survivor was travelling with Singh in his Maruti Swift when the accident took place near Gurbakshganj in Rae Bareli district on Sunday. In his application to the district administration dated July 15, Singh said he was an advocate as well as CBI witness in the rape case against Sengar.  “My request is pending before the district police and district administration for a long time. It has not been processed despite reminders. I suspect that I may be eliminated any time,” he wrote. It also mentioned that the request for a weapon was sought in September 2018, a month after CBI filed the chargesheet against Sengar and 20 others in the rape case. The lawyer also sent a copy of his letter to CBI headquarters in Delhi and its Lucknow office. Singh’s letter was marked to Unnao district magistrate three days after the rape survivor and her mother wrote a letter to Delhi high court chief justice informing him about the threats from the henchmen of Sengar and co-accused Shashi Singh. The victim’s family claimed that the henchmen came to their home in Makhi on July 7 and 8 and issued threats and warning. They also attached a video of a car and two men knocking at their door and threatening them. “We have attached screen-shots of a video showing Shashi Singh’s husband Haripal Singh,” it said. "
Lucknow,"20km from crash site, truck's number plate was clean &amp; clear","LUCKNOW: The truck that hit the car of Unnao rape survivor had a clean and clear number plate when it passed through the toll plaza at Lalganj in Rae Bareli, about 20km from the crash site in Gurbakshganj police station area on the fateful day hours before the accident. The CCTV footage of Old Lalganj toll plaza shows the truck entering around 5.20am, while the accident took place at 12.40pm. The footage shows that the number plate of the truck was clean and its number was clearly visible. When the accident took place, the truck's number plate was smeared with grease. Interestingly, police had claimed that the truck owner, Devendra Singh revealed that the number plate was deliberately smudged to evade the financier's staff since he had defaulted on loan instalment payments. Rae Bareli SP, Sushil Kumar Singh told TOI, ""Prima facie, it appears that the truck driver smeared the number plate with grease after passing through the toll plaza."" The truck delivered the sand consignment at the construction material store of Sohrab in Rajghat area about 30km away. The driver smeared it with grease, he added. ""The driver might have put grease on the plate while returning to Fatehpur. The driver and cleaner have already been arrested. Now, the case is with CBI, they will uncover the truth,"" he added. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Three kill friend ‘boasting of wealth’,"GHAZIABAD: Three men arrested for the murder of a 14-year-old boy have told police they allegedly killed him because of his taunts that they were not as rich as him. Chaman, a Class IX student at a Loni school, was found dead on a vacant plot near a temple two days ago. He had been missing since July 30. Chaman’s uncle Sanjay Kumar had accused three local youths — Arun, Pravesh and Shekhar — of abducting and murdering him. In his complaint, Sanjay had alleged that the trio had taken Chaman along to attend a public feast in a temple. Since then, the 14-year-old has been missing. The trio had apparently told Chaman’s family that the boy had left with two other youths. The trio were arrested on Thursday morning from Loni. During interrogation, they told police that Chaman would boast about his higher living standards and that they were not as rich as him. Since then, the accused had been nursing a grudge against Chaman. Police said that on their way back from the temple, the trio lured Chaman to a field and strangled him to death with a belt.

Lucknow,Family wants Unnao rape survivor's treatment to continue in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: The family members of the Unnao rape survivor on Thursday said they would continue with the girl’s medical treatment at Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University, even as the Supreme Court inquired if the survivor and her lawyer are in a condition to be airlifted to Delhi for treatment. The family also said that if the SC deems fit, it could send a panel of medical experts to Lucknow to help in the treatment. The family members said they had full faith in KGMU doctors who had assured them of their efforts. They also said that Delhi was out of bounds for them with no relatives or connections to help them during the course of treatment. They also denied having made any request for transfer to Delhi for treatment. The rape survivor’s mother told TOI that she was satisfied with the treatment in Lucknow and would want to continue with the same. “The doctors told me she will get better. They have made an incision in her throat and put a pipe for breathing. They have assured me she will be fine. I want her to be treated by them here,” she said. “We don’t know anyone in Delhi. How will we manage things around the treatment and the case there?” she added. On Thursday, a medical board of five doctors including the administrative officials of King George’s Medical University sat together in the afternoon, soon after the SC sought a report on the condition of the injured. “King George’s Medical University was asked two questions. The first was if the rape survivor and her lawyer are in a condition to be airlifted to Delhi. To this, the university’s answer was yes. The second question was if KGMU was giving the two patients competent treatment, and the answer to that was also in the affirmative,” said a KGMU official. “The family knows hardly anyone in Delhi. Here, even in bad times, relatives from Lucknow, Rae Bareli, Unnao and other districts have come to help us out. How will all that be possible in Delhi?” said the uncle of the rape survivor’s father and another family member. “If the SC wants and deems it fit, a panel of expert doctors can be sent here from Delhi for the same purpose,” added the uncle.

Lucknow,SC decision in Unnao case stamp on UP govt's failure: Priyanka Gandhi,"NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said the Supreme Court's ruling in the Unnao rape case is a ""stamp"" on the prevailing ""jungle raj"" in Uttar Pradesh and the state government's failure. The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a slew of instructions in the case, including directing the transfer of all five cases registered in connection with the Unnao rape incident from a court in Uttar Pradesh to a court in national capital. ""The Supreme Court's decision is a stamp on the prevailing jungle raj in Uttar Pradesh and the state government's failure,"" Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. ""The BJP has finally acknowledged that it had given protection to a criminal and by expelling him it has taken at least one step to correct its mistake,"" she said. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and 10 others on the charge of murder in the accident case of the Unnao rape survivor. The girl has accused the lawmaker of raping her at his residence in 2017, when she was a minor. The rape case against Sengar was filed after the woman tried to immolate herself outside UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath's residence in Lucknow in April last year. On Sunday, her car was hit by a truck when she was going to meet her uncle Mahesh Singh in a Rae Bareli jail. Two of her relatives were killed in the accident, while the rape survivor and her lawyer are undergoing treatment at a Lucknow hospital, where their condition is stated to be critical.

We are hopeful of getting justice in the case now, that the SC has intervened,” he added. “Sengar is a powerful man. We wanted the cases to be shifted and are happy that this has been done. Now, all cases against her (survivor) uncle should also be dismissed. We will go far away once it is done,” said survivor’s mother. The survivor, her mother and aunt, who died on Sunday, had sent a letter to the Chief Justice of India a fortnight ago, informing that they were being repeatedly threatened by Sengar’s henchmen.

Refuting media reports that he had links with Devendra Singh, owner of the truck involved in the car crash, Singh said: “I have no connection with the driver or cleaner or owner of the truck. The reports floating in the media are incorrect.” Singh, a block pramukh from Nawabganj in Unnao, said he owns two petrol pumps in Lucknow and his father Devesh is also a businessman in Unnao. “I came to know about the name of the survivor’s uncle from media after Sengar was accused in the case last year. I know Sengar for long because he is MLA from Bangarmau while I am a block pramukh from Nawabganj, which falls in his constituency,” he added. Singh was named among the 10 identified accused, including Sengar, for the accident in which the Unnao rape survivor was injured and her two aunts were killed.

Did you approve of the SP-BSP alliance?Our party president did an experiment thinking it will yield better results. It didn’t turn out as we expected it to be. “ Wo khatm kar do giley aaj mil kar galey, khair yoon hee sahi hum burey tum bhaley”. There was unanimity in the party that we should put up a strong alliance against the ruling BJP. It is a known fact that Dalits have historically been at the receiving end of every dispensation. Only if the Mughal kings had made universities and education institutions instead of Taj Mahal. There would have been 2,000 universities instead of one Taj Mahal. India would have been the global hub of education and Muslims would have been the most educated community in the world. You have seen Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh from close quarters. How different are they?Netaji and I had to go through a lot of struggle to establish the Samajwadi Party and state governments. He used to say, “ desh bachega to dharm bachega, jab desh hee nahi bachega to dharm kaise bachega”. This helped us get votes from both Hindus and Muslims. Now we are ready for a new struggle under Akhilesh. Where do you see the opposition headed considering they are disjointed?I spent almost two years in jail after the Emergency in 1975 under the MISA. That time people thought I was a criminal like they think today. Today those arrested under MISA are given the same status as freedom fighters. I even get a Loktantra Senani pension. People had almost given up home during Indira Gandhi’s regime but an old man like Jayprakash (JP) gave a clarion call and united the nation. What about the criminalisation of Triple Talaq Bill?People are either not being able to understand it or are not being made to understand this. The Holy Quran has given a procedure for talaq. It’s a personal issue of how you get married and how you want to give talaq. This can be decided in the nikahnama itself how the bride and the groom want to give talaq or not. I wanted to explain the issue in Parliament but was not allowed to speak. "

Ghaziabad,"Takers few, GDA slashes flat rates in Madhuban","GHAZIABAD: In a bid to attract buyers for its properties, the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has slashed the prices of its EWS and LIG flats in Madhuban Bapudham by more than 50%. An EWS flat that was earlier priced about Rs 10 lakh will now be available for Rs 4.5 lakh. Likewise, the price of a LIG flat has been brought down from Rs 23 lakh to Rs 10.8 lakh. There are 296 EWS and 170 LIG flats in Madhuban Bapudham. Those who earn up to Rs 3 lakh per annum can apply for an EWS flat; for LIG flats, the limit is Rs 6 lakh per annum. The scheme will be opened to public for a month from August 5, said a GDA official. GDA has housing units in Indirapuram, Swarnjayantipuram, Vaishali, Nandgram, Indraprasth and Madhuban Bapudham. It has been forced to think of sweeteners because its properties have failed to attract buyers for some time now. “It is a big step to provide affordable houses to residents. Moreover, the selected applicants will have to pay just 10% initially and the rest of the amount can be paid in installments in a stipulated time frame,” the official said, adding that the prices have been slashed following a state government’s order. There are also 17 MIG flats in Indirapuram for which applications will be sought. The details of the housing schemes will be uploaded on the GDA website soon. In another development, GDA has planned to auction 225 properties from August 7-13. It had formed a committee earlier under its secretary to find the reasons why properties were not finding buyers in auctions. "
Kanpur,‘I knew I’ll be sacrificing my acting career when I joined politics: Ravi Kishan,"A seasoned actor and now a Member of Parliament, priorities have surely changed for actor Ravi Kishan. While earlier it was acting and family, ""It’s now working for the people,” says the actor. ""My whole thought process has changed after being elected,"" says Ravi, who was in Kanpur recently to shoot a film. “I know I won’t be getting too many acting offers but I am content,"" he adds. Having been out from Mumbai since before the General Elections, Ravi says life for him has completely changed. ""Abhi tak meri parliament mein poori attendance rahi hai. Isi wajah se main jab se election mein jeeta hoon abhi tak Mumbai nahi jaa saka hoon. Bahut saare saansad film aur sports se pehle bhi elect hokar sansad bhawan mein aaye hain par professional business ki wajah se unki attendance low rehti thi. And that is why they were criticized and were not taken seriously. But I want to be taken seriously as a politician,"" says Ravi. Ravi Kishan (BCCL/ AS Rathor) Ravi Kishan (BCCL/ AS Rathor) Enjoying his stint in the parliament, Ravi as an actor feels that now he may not get as many roles owing to his busy schedule. ""I have done almost six hundred films till now. Jaunpur mein ek mitti ke ghar mein mera janm hua thi. Wahan se Mumbai aa kar maine apne aap ko ek actor ke roop mein establish kiya hai. I was leading a life of a king."" Ravi goes on to add, ""I have worked with acclaimed filmmakers like Shyam Benegal, Mani Ratnam, Anurag Kashyap and Tigmanshu Dhulia. I had a settled career and I never thought of getting such a massive win in the election. Initially, I wanted to campaign for the party but when the party asked me to contest for the election I gracefully accepted the offer.""

But I am okay with it. There are other ways too of serving people. If not through acting, it will be through politics,"" says Ravi who will next be seen in the John Abraham starrer Batla House. Speaking about the film 'Dronacharya' which is being shot in Kanpur, Ravi Kishan, says, ""This is a non-masala film. The plot of the film deals with the sensitive issue of right to education. Aaj har shehar mein ek se ek badhiya schools hain par kya sabhi bacchon ko quality education mil paa rahi hai? The film is based on that topic. I am playing a role of drama teacher in the movie. What’s special about this movie is that all the other characters in the film are from a theatre background. In fact, many theatre artists from Kanpur are also working with me in this film. I have an old association with Kanpur and that’s why we thought of shooting this film in the city. I personally want that theatre in the city should get stronger in days to come. Busy hone ki wajah se abhi back to back shoot toh nahi kar paunga par ek mahine tak har weekend par Kanpur aa kar film ke liye shoot karunga,"" he says as he signs off. "

Lucknow,"Unnao rape survivor accident case: Killer truck’s number plate was clean, CCTV shows","LUCKNOW: The truck that   hit the car of Unnao rape survivor   had a clean and clear number plate when it crossed the toll plaza at Lalganj in Rae Bareli, about 20km from the crash site in Gurbakshganj police station area hours before the accident. CCTV footage of the toll plaza shows the truck entering around 5.20am on July 28, while the accident took place around 12.40pm. The footage shows that the number plate of the truck was clean and the registration number was clearly visible. However, when the accident took place, the number plate was found smeared with grease. Local police had claimed that truck owner Devendra Singh told them that the number plate was deliberately smudged to evade the financier’s staff since he had defaulted on loan instalments. “Prima facie, it appears that the truck driver smeared the number plate with grease after passing through the toll plaza,” Rae Bareli SP Sushil Kumar Singh told TOI. The truck delivered a sand consignment at a construction material outlet at Sohrab in Rajghat area about 30km away before it headed for Fatehpur. “The driver might have put grease on the plate while returning to Fatehpur. The driver and cleaner have already been arrested. Now, the case is with Central Bureau of Investigation, they will uncover the truth,” Singh added. "
Lucknow,Uncle of Unnao rape survivor shifted to Tihar under CRPF cover,"LUCKNOW: A day after the Supreme Court directed the CBI to finish the investigation into the crash involving the Unnao rape survivor, her two aunts and their lawyer, the UP government on Friday evening transferred the rape survivor's uncle from Rae Bareli prison to the high-security Tihar jail in Delhi.  The survivor's uncle left Rae Bareli jail around 8.35pm under a two-layer security cover of CRPF and was expected to reach Tihar early on Saturday morning after a 10-hour journey. The security cordon, led by a sub-divisional magistrate, comprised six trucks of CRPF and a police vehicle. The outer security cordon comprised 15 CRPF personnel while six personnel were part of the inner cordon. DG (prisons) Anand Kumar told TOI that the transfer was done after the SC asked the UP government on Thursday whether the survivor's uncle should be moved out of Rae Bareli prison. The uncle, who had been lodged in Rae Bareli jail since February, had written several applications to authorities seeking transfer from the prison alleging threat to his life from rape-accused MLA Kuldeep Sengar and his henchmen.

Lucknow,A death unites feuding communities in Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW: Two Uttar Pradesh villages riven by a sedition FIR against 60 youths for allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans appeared to rediscover common ground on Friday after the father of one of the accused became so anxious about his son’s fate that he died of cardiac arrest. Saleh Nagar village, on the fringes of Lucknow, had been over the edge since Shashank Gehlot, a resident of the adjoining hamlet of Ruchi Khand, and two Bajrang Dal workers lodged the FIR at Aashiana police station against 21-year-old Akram Ali and 59 others from the neighbourhood. The complainants accused the group of raising pro-Pakistan slogans during an altercation last Tuesday over an incident as trivial as a motorbike’s modified silencer making too much noise. Sources said the village got divided along communal lines when police slapped Section 124A of the IPC, which deals with sedition, on the accused. A series of raids to arrest them followed, prompting those who had been named in the FIR to flee. Akram was among those who fled, leaving his elderly parents worrying about his safety. The father, Zakir Ali, became so anxious that he suffered a heart attack after midnight on Thursday and, with no one around to take him to hospital, he died around 3am, the family said. Holding the “false case” against Akram responsible for Ali’s death, 100-odd villagers started a sit-in around 6am on Friday and refused to bury the body. They relented only around 5pm after senior officials assured them a “counter FIR” would be lodged over Tuesday’s clash. News about the circumstances of Ali’s death appeared to not only calm frayed nerves but also prompted Hindu villagers of Ruchi Khand to troop to Saleh Nagar to stand by the family. Late on Friday, a cross FIR was filed against seven named and 25 unidentified persons in the sedition case by Zakir’s wife, who identified the rioters as Bajrang Dal and Bhagwa Raksha Vahini activists.

Lucknow,UP: Grandma gored to death by stray cow while saving boy,"LUCKNOW: A 70-year-old woman was gored to death by a stray cow while trying to save her 4-year-old grandson from the attack. The incident occurred when Vimla Singh, a resident of Rajajipuram, went for a walk with her grandson Vishnu around 10pm on Thursday. According to Vimla's son Raja, Vishu was playing on the street and his mother was sitting on a nearby staircase when a stray cow came running towards his four-year-old son. Vimla SinghSensing trouble, Vimla ran towards her grandson and took him in her arms. However, the cow repeatedly hit the septuagenarian, causing severe head injuries. Hearing her shrieks, neighbours rushed out of their houses and shoved the bovine away. A bleeding Vimla was rushed to a private hospital, where doctors referred her to KGMU trauma centre. However, she was declared brought dead due to excessive bleeding. This is the fourth death in stray cattle attack in the city in three months. More than 24 people have been injured in similar attacks. On January 3. the state government had ordered the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) to catch all stray cattle from roads and shift them to shelter homes. However, the civic body has failed to comply with the order even after seven months. Chief veterinary officer Arvind Rao said, ""We are conducting regular drives to catch stray animals. We will try to catch all the stray cattle in next two months."" "
Lucknow,Flare-up in Aashiana: Hindu neighbours junk sedition charge,"LUCKNOW: Hindu residents of Salehnagar village in Aashiana have come out in support of their Muslim neighbours, dubbing the sedition case against 60 minority community youths as fabricated and ""an attempt by right-wing groups"" to drive a wedge between two communities living peacefully in the area for decades. The show of solidarity has been spurred by the tragic death of Zakir Ali (55) whose 20-year-old son Akram is among the accused. Ali, allegedly humiliated by policemen during the raid following Tuesday's clash, succumbed to cardiac arrest in the small hours of Friday. Saurabh Kashyap, a friend of Akram, said they were childhood buddies. ""We grew up together. None of us ever made any derogatory remark against each other's religion. All the accused, including Akram, have been framed. I don't believe anyone from here will ever raise pro-Pakistan slogans,"" he said. Ajay Singh (48), a neighbour of Ali, underscored that Hindus and Muslims had peacefully coexisted in Salehnagar for generations. ""There have been fights, like it happens among youngsters everywhere, but these have always been resolved amicably,"" Singh said. ""An ego clash between youths of Salehnagar and adjoining Ruchi Khand is being given communal colour by right-wing outsiders,"" he added.  Ankur Lodhi, who is 18, echoed that right-wing people ""are trying to drive a wedge between Hindu and Muslim brothers. Fifty-year-old Dukhi Rawat couldn't agree more. ""Muslims and Hindus in Salehnagar have lived like family. They have been together in joy and sorrow. Zakir was a friend of mine. His death has left us all shocked and deeply saddened.""  Student Raman Soni, 22, said he had so long only heard about people being framed. ""Now, I know how it feels. Many of my Muslim friends are so terrified by the sedition charge itself that they are not going to police to explain their side of the story,"" he said. "

Lucknow,When brands find their conscience,"This week, Zomato became an unlikely spokesperson for constitutional values when it told Jabalpur resident Amit Shukla who complained about a ‘non-Hindu rider’ to take his ‘non-secular’ business elsewhere. It’s not that India is new to such biases. Sections of upper castes have for generations refused to eat food cooked by Dalits or even let them enter their kitchens. But with social media giving bigots a platform to air and amplify their opinions, companies face a new challenge — take a stance on social issues and risk the wrath of the Twitter mob or refuse to wade into any controversial issue. Corporate responses have varied. Last year, when an Ola customer from Lucknow tweeted that he had cancelled his cab because his driver had a “Muslim” name, the cab aggregator replied that it was a “secular platform” that did not discriminate against their drivers or customers on the basis of caste, religion, gender or creed. A few months later, when a woman refused to interact with a Muslim customer executive from Airtel and asked for a Hindu representative to be assigned, Shoaib was replaced by one Gaganjot. After some social media heat, the telecom company clarified that it did not “differentiate between customers, employees and partners on the basis of caste or religion”. Earlier in 2016, Snapdeal snapped its ties with brand ambassador Aamir Khan soon after he spoke up against intolerance. But was Zomato being heroic, or strategic? Marketing experts point out that brands are aligning themselves with progressive social causes in a bid to appeal to younger audiences. In fact, there’s a thin line between wokeness and virtue signaling but brands still want to tread that path even if purpose isn’t always profitable. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSSaudi's response on India's oil reserves 'undiplomatic': PradhanUnion minister for oil, petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday termed Saudi Arabia's response on India's strategic oil reserves as 'undiplomatic' and said that India is conscious about its interest.PM Modi invites 50 Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to visit IndiaAddressing Bangladesh's 50th Independence Day anniversary at the National Parade Square, Modi said: ""It is a happy coincidence that the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's liberation and the milestone of the 75th year of India's independence have arrived together.Internationally, Nike sales grew after its campaign featuring American footballer Colin Kaepernick, who kneeled during the US national anthem to protest racial injustice. However, a Gillette short film taking on toxic masculinity resulted in an $8billion hit on its bottomline. Despite the losses, Gillette CEO Gary Coombe told reporters this week that he didn’t regret the marketing campaign which replaced its slogan ‘the best a man can get’ with ‘the best a man can be’. “I don’t enjoy that some people were offended by the film and upset at the brand as a consequence. But I am absolutely of the view now that for the majority of people to fall more deeply in love with today’s brands you have to risk upsetting a small minority, and that’s what we’ve done,” Coombe said. For Zomato, too, the initial rush of laudatory tweets was soon overtaken by a viral boycott call. It is still important for companies such as Zomato and Ola to call out unfair demands from customers, says brand strategist M G Parameswaran. “Now because of social media, these biases and deep scars in society are coming out in the open. It is the time for big brands to stand up and say we won’t take this anymore. There will always be a fringe group that supports crazy demands but the company has to have the mettle to say it can’t support this,” he says. Indian customers seem to like brands with a conscience, as long as they stay out of religion and politics. In a recent study by YouGov India, 76% of respondents said it was important that the brands they liked had a point of view on issues related to society, a figure that was higher than the US and UK. Yet, while environment and gender equality were considered to be acceptable topics for a brand to address, religion (18%) and politics (24%) were the least accepted. Sometimes, there’s no choice but to wade in. “Social media being what it is, once somebody demands special treatment based on religious preferences, the brand has to respond,” says Sabyasachi Mitter of digital marketing agency Fulcro. “They need to be on the right side of the constitution and equality, and never succumb to anything discriminatory.” The approach differs — new-age brands such as Zomato are often more edgy and irreverent than established ones. “Sometimes it works for them, sometimes it doesn’t.” Latest CommentOOKTanushree SarkarSee All CommentsAdd commentFor example, Rahul Deorah, VP, Urbanclap, says they would have taken the same position as Zomato. “Service professionals who work so hard to ensure that consumers’ lives are convenient don’t deserve to be discriminated against,” he says. “Like Zomato, we would be happy to lose a few customers on the path to our values.” While it is rare for corporate India to speak out openly against bigotry, activist Harsh Mander, whose Karwan-e-Mohabbat initiative spotlighted incidents of violence across the country, says that it is important to call out discrimination and hate speech. “The crisis of the times we live in is that people are not calling this out in our daily life and interactions and remain silent,” he says. “It is important for young people and society to hear that this is wrong.” "
Lucknow,Lucknowites and their furry BFFs are setting new #friendshipgoals,"This Friendship Day is going to be about pooch love for some pet parents in the city who prefer to celebrate the day with their four-legged friends. And while most prefer a pedigree dog, there are some in Lucknow who shower all their love on strays, so often found abused and neglected on the streets. Today, on Friendship Day LT features a few of these pet parents who have given these strays a home and in turn have got a best friend. Chitra Singh, a salon owner, is an ardent animal lover and is often seen at animal rescue drives and helping abandoned animals getting adopted. A mother to several stray pooches, Chitra says, “When I see these beautiful creatures looking at me apprehensively, I instantly know they need me and that I need to be there for them. I have almost 5-6 rescue dogs with me and Krishnakali is my latest rescue who has now become my best friend. I got this cutie on January 28th.” Chitra Singh spending some loving moments with her best friends (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Chitra Singh spending some loving moments with her best friends (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) When asked about why a stray and not a pedigree dog for her, Chitra says, “Buying a dog is very different from adopting a stray and giving it a quality life. You just see a creature in need and extend help. Most people I know, who have rescued these lifelong companions, are very compassionate towards them.” Adding further she says, “Besides Indie strays are well-accustomed to the climate here; right from their hair to food to immunity to everything else. I feel Indians should get or rescue more of these Indies. If at all they are very fond of fancy western breeds, they can keep that along with one Indie. It’ll not only help a soul but also clear the streets of these homeless animals.” Shubhra with her “best friend” Tiger (BCCL/ Farhan Ahamd Siddiqui)  Shubhra with her “best friend” Tiger (BCCL/ Farhan Ahamd Siddiqui) Shubhra Lal, a Lucknowite, is often seen feeding strays around her house. It’s a sight to watch whenever Shubhra comes back home from somewhere as all the strays come running to welcome her back. “I love animals in general. Strays, however, have always been very close to my heart. There’s no one to look after them yet these cute little bundles of fur are so loving. They give all the possible love they can. I’ve never differentiated between my stray and my other breeds. I love them both equally as a mother and a best friend. Some people have questioned me why I got a stray home or sometimes they’re just like ‘Oh! He’s not good looking enough. You should get rid of him.’ Some people are okay with that but I get offended by something like this.” She goes on to add, “I adopted my best friend, Tiger (her stray dog) in November. I have seen this little baby grow in front of my eyes. When I got him home, he looked so frail. I was scared if he’ll survive. So I thought I’ll give him an empowering name like Tiger and to my surprise, he is living up to that name. Tiger is a wild child, but very intelligent indeed.” Caroline Borges Lamba is a mother and friend to several strays in the city (BCCL/ Farhan Ahamd Siddiqui)  Caroline Borges Lamba is a mother and friend to several strays in the city (BCCL/ Farhan Ahamd Siddiqui) A best friend is someone who never fails to make you smile and these dogs do just the same for these stray pet parents. “Recently one of my friends died very tragically. It left my friends and I devastated. We were shattered, especially since he was such a close friend. Just rescuing these cute little babies and trying to take care of them, it’s given me some kind of peace,” says Caroline Borges Lamba, a teacher at a school in the city and a mother and a friend to several strays. “It’s magical! It’s also scientifically proven how animals have the power to take people out of their depression. Anyone who wants a friend, rescue a dog or adopt a stray. They’re the best. The love is unconditional and selfless. Animals, especially dogs are my best friends,” says Caroline. Anisha Verma with her furry friend Bucky (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)  Anisha Verma with her furry friend Bucky (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Anisha Verma, a resident of Munshi Puliya, owns six dogs among which two of them are Indian breeds. She claims that Indian breeds comparatively tend to show more love towards their owners and make for very good friends, “Me and my dog Bucky we’re pretty close. He sleeps with me, plays with me and we’re just like best friends. In fact, I have two strays and they are trained by me. I have a number of other breeds too, I have a Labrador and a German Shepherd and if you’ll look at it that way, Indian breeds are always going to love you more. I’ve had them for one year and they always have had been a delight.” Eighteen and Gola are two Indie dogs who have been adopted by Eddie Lovie Samuel (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)  Eighteen and Gola are two Indie dogs who have been adopted by Eddie Lovie Samuel (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Eighteen and Gola are two Indie dogs who have been adopted by Eddie Lovie Samuel, who lives in India Nagar. Eddie shares the first time he met Eighteen on a street and how she became a special companion and a friend to his family. “Two years back, on a winter eve, we were returning from a New Year’s party and we saw Eighteen on the street. I tried to rescue her because she was not more than two-months old and I tried to hold her and started to comfort her. Then she didn’t leave my car so I brought her home. Next day we fed her and tried to let her go but she didn’t leave. Since that time she’s been with us at our place and we are very happy. She’s our companion and a dear friend now.” Cyrus Cowasji, who has rescued not just dogs, but monkeys, donkeys, horses and cats, among others, has several dogs too at his farm in Gomti Nagar. “I adopt strays because I, as an animal lover and activist, consider it my duty to give a homeless a home and keep them like all other animals. Everyone likes pedigree dogs and these poor guys are the toughest of all the dogs, they defend themselves on the road, they know how to deal with all sorts of weather. They are different from other pets because they are grateful and turn real loyal pets. I’m grateful to them as many of my strays, being healthy dogs have donated blood to dogs in need and saved lives. They have proven to be fast learners. They are tough, strong and can take on any task without thinking twice. They don’t get sick very fast and are an all-terrain pet. I brought home my first stray at the age of 3 when I saw her lying on the road homeless and ever since it has been 25 years and the stone hasn't stopped rolling. Now on a daily basis, I pick up strays which need a home desperately and they have become a part of my family. I have got 15 strays at the moment, and I hope to give shelter to more and more stray dogs and I proudly say that they are my Best Friends Forever,” says Cyrus as he cuddles and feeds three of them. — Saad Abbasi and Yashi Agarwal "
Lucknow,My best wishes are with Sengar: BJP MLA,"LUCKNOW: Two days after being expelled from his party for his alleged involvement in the Unnao rape case, Bangarmau MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar found support from BJP’s Bilgram-Mallanwan MLA Ashish Singh, who said Sengar was passing through “difficult times” and needed good wishes to come out of the crisis. The party disowned his comment. “Kathinaiyon ke daur se guzar rahe hum sab ke bhai aadarniya Kuldeep Singh Sengar-ji kinhi karanon se hum sabke beech yahan nahi hain. Samay ka kaal-chakra kahaan jayega, phir bhi hum sabki shubhkamnayein unke saath hain. (Our respected brother Sengar is passing through difficult times and is not with us here. But our best wishes are with him),” Singh said. MLA hopes Sengar represents people ‘again soon’, BJP calls it his ‘personal opinion’ Bilgram-Mallanwan MLA Ashish Singh sympathised with rape accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar while addressing a gathering at the swearing ceremony of Ganj Moradabad nagar panchayat chairman and members in Unnao on Friday. A video of Singh’s address has gone viral on social media. Singh, in the video, hoped Sengar represents the people “again soon”. The state BJP unit was quick to distance itself from his comments. “It must be his personal opinion about Sengar, who has already been sacked by party’s central leadership,” said Harish Chandra Srivastava, UP BJP spokesperson. Party sources said Singh may have made the comment since he was speaking in Unnao, where Sengar and his family wield considerable political influence. Singh could not be reached as his phone was switched off. "
Kanpur,‘Ensure cleanliness for nation’s progress’,"Kanpur: Minister for industrial development Satish Mahana said cleanliness is an essential element for progress and development of the country. Speaking at a event organised under the Swachcha Bharat Mission at Chandra Shekhar Azad Agriculture and Technical University auditorium here on Saturday, he called upon the people to focus more on cleanliness and water conservation. He asked the people to desist from over exploitation of underground water as it is a valuable asset. He called upon the gram pradhans to create awareness among villagers about water conservation and tell them not to waste it. He also asked the villagers to plant more and more saplings in barren land. On this occasion, the minister felicitated 10 gram pradhans, 6 panchayat secretaries, 10 beneficiaries and 5 sanitation workers for their work in the sphere of cleanliness. Abhijeet Sanga, MLA from Bithoor, said that after the Central and the state governments had adopted cleanliness as a mission, thousands of toilets were constructed in villages. Arun Pathak, MLC, said that cleanliness and water conservation were very important. ""We all must take a pledge to save water and observe cleanliness in our lives"", he said. "
Lucknow,"Lost tigers of UP: Over 6 years, 5 big cats have died of ‘unknown’ reasons","LUCKNOW: Over the past six years, more tigers have died in UP due to ‘unknown’ causes than have died due to unnatural causes. This means that in quite a few instances, UP is yet to decipher the reason behind a tiger’s death, each of which is considered a matter of national importance. Data compiled by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) on tiger mortalities in UP between 2012 and 2018 shows at least five deaths to be ‘under-scrutiny’ where the reason for the death has not been established. The total number of tiger deaths reported during the period is 31. This includes two unnatural and eight natural deaths, the data showed. Among the remaining, 10 deaths were due to poaching and six were caused by seizure, which means parts of its body were found from outside forest area—this is loosely related to poaching. For five deaths, however, no reason was found. In such cases, the body is found in the forest area but cause is unknown. The data did not give year-wise break-up. The reasons for unnatural deaths of tigers could be many, such as infighting, conflict with humans, rail or road accidents, electrocution or drowning. Whenever a tiger carcass is spotted in the forest area or outside, the field staff report it to the higher authorities. Many senior forest officers who have served as wildlife officers in protected areas said it is a challenge to establish the cause of the death of a tiger. “Many a times, the carcass is reported by villagers. By the time a forest team reaches the scene, it has already been disturbed,” said an officer. Besides, the field staff may not have an expert’s eye. Every tiger death is reported to the NTCA, a statutory body under the Union ministry of forests, environment and climate change. That makes every tiger death a matter of “extreme” importance. Data from Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), an organization that works closely with the government on wildlife crime control and investigation, showed that more tigers die due to reasons other than poaching in UP.

Lucknow,Realtor injured as BMW sprayed with bullets near Golf City home,"LUCKNOW: A 45-year-old real estate businessman was shot at and injured inside Golf City along Shaheed Path on Saturday morning, making it the second such crime in a VIP area of the state capital in four days and the fourteenth shooting in the city since January. Block C3 resident Sunil Singh, driving to work in his white BMW around 10am, ran into a volley of shots from both sides of the road near Block C1, barely 800 metres from home and a stone’s throw from Shaheed Path. Witnesses have told police that there were three assailants and they heard at least five gunshots. One bullet hit Singh below the chest and three drilled holes into his car’s bonnet, left front door and right rear door. The impact shattered windows on both sides. A fifth bullet possibly missed target. Despite being wounded, the businessman called his wife, Ranjana, who rushed in another car with their driver and took him to hospital. Doctors KGMU Trauma Centre said his condition was stable. Two private security guards, Anshu Nishad and Ankit Awasthi, who helped Ranjana take her injured husband to hospital told TOI they first thought someone was bursting firecrackers. “We realised something was wrong only when we saw three men zip past on a bike. We went near the car and found him (Singh) bleeding and trying to call someone on his phone,” Nishad said. Awasthi said they helped shift the victim to the other car. “He was first taken to a nearby private hospital, but referred to RML Institute of Medical Sciences. After first aid there, he was shifted to KGMU Trauma Centre.” Station house officer of PGI thana Ashok Kumar Saroj said the gunmen stood on both sides and the modus operandi indicated that they were aware of their target’s movements. “The three sped away only after the businessman slumped on the seat. They perhaps presumed him dead,” the officer said. SP north Sukirti Madhav said, “We have recovered CCTV footage from the area in which three suspect youths are seen speeding away on a bike.” “An attempt to murder FIR has been lodged against three unidentified persons on the complaint of the victim’s wife. We will record the statement of the victim and his family members,” SHO Saroj added. Trauma Centre in-charge and KGMU spokesperson Dr Sandeep Tiwari said an X-ray showed the bullet lodged below the left side of the patient’s chest. “His vitals are currently stable. He is under observation.” "
Lucknow,"Unnao rape survivor accident case: CBI, forensic experts visit crash site, recreate events","LUCKNOW: CBI investigators and Central Forensic Science Laboratory experts visited the crash site in Rae Bareli on Saturday and recreated the sequence of events of the accident that left the Unnao rape survivor and her lawyer critically injured on July 28. The CBI and forensic team tried to determine if the crash was caused by negligence and rash driving of the truck driver or there was a sinister design to target the rape survivor. A six-member team of CFSL experts took measurements at the crash site in Gurubakshganj, besides noting positions of the car and truck. The team tried to find out how the rear part of truck rammed the car. The crash marks on the truck chassis suggest there was no head-on collision. The CBI team established the sequence of events leading to the crash and will now take truck driver, Ashish Pal, and cleaner, Mohan, to the site to corroborate their findings. It measured and analysed the tyre-skid marks to determine the speeds of the two vehicles, the point and angle of impact and error on part of truck driver, if any. The FSL team picked clues to determine if grease was smeared on the truck’s number plate only after the accident since CCTV footage from Old Lalganj toll plaza, 20 km from the crash site, did not show any grease on the plate. CBI sleuths will trace truck’s movement to car crash sitePhotographs and preliminary investigation by FSL Lucknow team had revealed it was not a head-on collision as claimed by police, but the car had hit the rightside of truck. CBI team will also trace the truck’s movements after loading sand from Banda to the crash site and will question officials of the company that financed the truck. Talking to TOI, the financier said, the truck owner defaulted on instalments for a few months. The firm’s collection manager, Shashi Kumar, said Rs 1,62,000 was still pending, but clarified the company does not seize vehicles on loan default and follows due legal procedure. "
Lucknow,"UP: Patient dies, kin assault nurse; booked","LUCKNOW: Emergency services at Balrampur hospital were hit for an hour on Saturday as paramedical staff went on a flash strike to protest assault on a nurse by daughter of a patient who died. A 55-year-old patient suffering from kidney disease was brought to the emergency ward in morning. The woman died at around 7.30pm.

Lucknow,Cardiac emergency shifted from Lari Cardiology Centre to Trauma Centre,"LUCKNOW: King George’s Medical University has shifted cardiology emergency services from Lari Cardiology Centre to Trauma Centre but the new set-up lacks advanced lifesaving infrastructure and patients needing ICU and angioplasty are still being rushed back to the building across the road. As a result, heart patients needing instant help are first admitted to Trauma Centre and then sent to Lari Cardiology Centre in ambulance, wasting crucial time during an emergency. The section was shifted on Friday afternoon after resident doctors went on a flash strike when kin of a patient who was declared brought dead created ruckus. A similar incident had occurred on July 13. The resident doctors resumed work after the emergency wing was shifted to Trauma Centre where six beds were allotted for cardiac patients in the casualty ward. On Saturday, patients arriving at Lari Cardiology were directed to Trauma Centre where some were discharged after first aid, while the critical ones were sent back to cardiology department in ambulance. Lari Centre had 31 beds for emergency patients, besides ICU and angioplasty facility under one roof. The family of Shiv Devi, a cardiac patient, brought her to Lari Centre from Barabanki but had to face problems. Her attendant, Rajendra, told TOI, “We faced great difficulty and some anxious moments and carried her to Trauma Centre on a stretcher in hurry.” Cardiology department associate professor, Akshay Pradhan, said, “Almost all the equipment and machines required for basic cardiac emergency treatment are available at Trauma Centre.” KGMU spokesperson Prof Sudhir Singh said that total 28 emergency cardiac patients arrived at Trauma Centre on Saturday, of which 18 were sent to cardiology department for admission.

Kanpur,"Scolded for poor marks, Kanpur boy shoots self with dad’s gun","KANPUR: A Class 12 student whipped out his father’s licensed revolver and shot himself in the head on Saturday in city’s Govindnagar area after being reprimanded by his father for securing poor marks. Anshuman, 17, who committed suicide, was the son of a PWD contractor Yogendra Singh Sengar. Police said, preliminary findings show the teenager sank into depression after being slapped and scolded by his father for his poor academic record. Inspector, Govindnagar, Sanjivkant Mishra told TOI Anshuman’s body was found in the bushes near his house with a revolver next to him. Residents of Ratan Lal Nagar Gujaini heard a gunshot and found the teen’s blood-splattered body in the bushes. Police were alerted and forensic experts dispatched to the site. “Anshuman didn’t betray any emotion when his mother, Poonam, told him to accompany her to Harmilap School for a parent-teacher’s meeting at 8:30am. The boy quietly told his mother he would soon join her after refuelling his scooty. Instead of going to school, Anshuman went to the bushes behind a private guesthouse and shot himself with his father’s gun,” said inspector Mishra. The boy’s scooty was found parked nearby. The body has been sent for autopsy. "
Lucknow,Frothing Gomti raises spectre of contaminated groundwater,"LUCKNOW: A highly polluted Gomti may contaminate groundwater if urgent steps are not taken to sanitise the lifeline river. At several points, the riverbed is made of porous sediment, which may allow pollutants to seep into underground aquifer, experts have warned. The fresh alert comes after the Uttar Pradesh Solid Waste Management and Monitoring Committee (UPSWMMC), a panel constituted by the NGT, issuing an advisory against using Gomti’s water for bathing, washing and other purposes. Statistics show that out of 2.46 lakh litres of sewage produced daily in Lucknow, around 1.44 lakh litres are treated while the rest flows unprocessed into the river through 33 high drains. Besides, 180 small drains also discharge effluents and solid waste into the river. A recent study by professor Venkatesh Dutta, a noted environmentalist, has also found that the dissolved oxygen level of Gomti is zilch in many places against a normal of 8.5 mg/litre. “The froth blanketing the river near Gomti barrage and Kudiya Ghat and Pipraghat is a sign that the situation is alarming,” said professor Dhruv Sen Singh of Lucknow University based on initial observations of his ongoing study on water quality of Gomti. “Frothing means extreme pollution. It occurs when untreated sewage, chemical discharge from factories, solid waste and organic substances release compounds known as surfactants,” Prof Singh said. High level of heavy metal contamination is also indicated through frothing. “Pollutants include nickel, cobalt, arsenic and cadmium. Since the Gomti riverbed is made of sand and silt, which are porous and permeable, these pollutants can trickle down with water and contaminate groundwater,” the professor said. Singh pointed out that in some places, a clay-like layer could also be found on the riverbed. “The layer is formed because of pollutants like construction material, sewage and household waste. This layer is not permeable and thus, acts as a barrier against pollutants seeping in. But, at the same time, it does not allow natural recharge of groundwater,” he added. Polluted groundwater can lead to health issues, including skin allergies and water-borne diseases such as typhoid and jaundice. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: 2,000 cows still on loose even as toll climbs, LMC wobbles","LUCKNOW: An elderly woman in Rajajipuram died on Thursday trying to save her grandson from a rogue cow, taking the toll to four in three months, but the LMC is yet to rein in stray cattle in the city. In January, the state authorities had tasked the civic guardian with the job and issued a deadline of 100 days. Seven months, four deaths and 24 injured victims later, the LMC says it still needs two more months to tame the problem. Times ViewAs another life was lost because Lucknow Municipal Corporation did not act despite complaints about stary cattle from residents in various parts of the city, it is time for people to seriously consider suing the municipal corporation for not providing required services and security to them. In fact, the staff members responsible for lapses should be booked for criminal negligence. With more than a dozen incidents in just four months, how long will people wait for before taking any action?There were around 6,000 bovine animals roaming the city streets at the beginning of the year. So far, 4,000 have been caught and shifted to shelters. But, the rest are still unrestrained. Earlier, the LMC had a stock excuse about lack of space. However, in April, the capacity of Kanha Upvan — the largest cattle shelter — was increased from 5,500 to 7,000 while a new one, Radha Upvan, was opened with a capacity of 3,000. There are also eight Kanji houses with a total capacity of 4,000. In other words, the 10 shelters can host 14,000 bovine animals. The current occupancy is 10,300, which means there is still room for 3,900. Officials claim they are, on an average, catching 40 animals daily. At this pace, it will take LMC at least two more months to free the city of stray cattle menace. LMC chief veterinary officer Arvind Rao said, “We are running a regular drive.” He also said the LMC had to stop the crackdown for a while in April-May after several employees were injured during the operations. Residents in Jankipuram, Mahanagar, Telibagh, Sadar, Thakurganj, Raqabganj and Rajajipuram voiced their fears. “Our lives are at risk. We are afraid to step out of homes, especially with children. Yesterday (Friday), I saw a two-wheeler rider having a narrow escape after a stray bull chased him,” said Kunal Verma, a commuter in Sadar area. Naman Shukla, a resident of Raqabganj, said LMC officials had promised to catch stray cattle. “Yet, I have not seen its animal squad in days.” In Jankipuram, people said the stray animals were damaging gardens and lawns. Rajat Sinha, a resident of Sector-H, said: “We had planted saplings in front of our house, but a stray bull flattened them all. We have lodged a complaint at the LMC helpline.” "
Lucknow,Lucknow University over the moon but planetarium’s future in darkness,"Alumna and Chandrayaan II mission director Ritu Karidhal Srivastava may have put Lucknow University (LU) over the moon, but the state’s first planetarium at LU’s department of mathematics and astronomy is slowly and steadily sinking into oblivion. The sky theatre, with a seating capacity of 300, had last simulated the motions of the heavens in 1985, during the 72nd edition of the Indian Science Congress. It has been lying neglected since. According to astronomy professors, aspiring space scientists were once taught the best celestial navigation techniques at the planetarium, which can’t be taught using video tutorials. “The planetarium was built in 1950, following efforts of professor AN Singh, and was the first in the state and among the few in the country back then. It taught students to look, feel and learn how to calculate exact planetary positions and identify constellations,” said former head of department professor Sushil Datta. “By the time I joined in 1989, it was a ghost of its past self. I made several attempts to revive the planetarium, but funds crunch always came in the way,” Datta, now retired, added. Astronomy students said they wanted the LU to do what it takes to bring the historical sky theatre back to life. “An in-house planetarium will be a blessing for researchers and space science enthusiasts. They will have access round the clock and won’t have to waste time visiting planetariums at other institutes,” said Divya Singh. Former student and currently faculty member professor Alka Mishra recalled that a mechanical projector was used in those days. “The dome screen used special paper and bulbs to create the illusion of a starry night.” According to professor Mishra, the biggest challenge for renovation is that the technology used back then is no longer availa b l e . “The structure is nearly 70 years old. Today, advanced technologies are used to simulate movement of planets and stars. And, we don’t have sufficient funds to give it an all-new look,” she explained. Not just the state’s oldest sky theatre, the nearly 100-year-old astronomy department of LU too needs a fresh lease of life. “The UGC had sanctioned a reader’s post for the department, but the same was transferred by the authorities to another department. There are just two people to teach astronomy here,” Datta said, adding, “In the absence of faculty members, the papers of astrophysics, cosmology and space dynamics introduced in MSc in 1989 could not be continued.” Apart from Osmania University (Hyderabad), Andhra University and Punjab University, LU is the only other seat of higher learning that offers astronomy at UG level. “The astronomy department here has churned out space scientists who now work for Isro — like Mohd Hassan, Satyaprakash Ojha and NASA. Yet, the department is crying for upgrade,” professor Mishra said, pushing a demand for a separate department with better resources. LU old boys, who have seen the glorious days of the astronomy department, recalled how stargazing was a religion unto itself. “It was 1986. The year of Halley’s Comet, which is visible from Earth once in every 75-76 years. The department was crowded. Telescopes were installed on the roof. The whole of Luckow seemed to have trooped to the campus,” said professor Kamal Kishore Agarwal. Head of LU’s geology department professor Rameshwar Bali recalled how the astronomy department was always a star attraction among students. “The telescope was used by enthusiasts from all departments. I still remember seeing Halley ’s Comet,” he said. Reviving the planetarium may seem like a pie in the sky, but academics and alumni are keeping their fingers crossed for a miracle. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad school cab driver shot dead by lover’s husband,"GHAZIABAD: A 25-year-old cab driver was allegedly shot dead by his live-in partner’s husband in Masuri on Saturday morning, when he was on the way to pick up students. According to police, he has been identified as Jitendra, a resident of Ghaziabad. He used to work as a driver in a private school located in Ghaziabad’s Masuri area. Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, SP (rural), told TOI, the crime took place around 6.30am. Before he could pick up any student, two bike-borne assailants approached the school vehicle from behind and shot a bullet at its tyre. “When Jitendra stopped the vehicle, the accused fired three bullets at him. Two hit Jitendra’s head and one went into his chest,” Jadaun added. “Some eye-witnesses informed us about the crime and we took him to the nearest private hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead,” he said. The police said Jitendra was allegedly shot at by his lover’s husband. They added that he was in a “live-in relationship” with the woman for the past three years. “Jitendra had come to Ghaziabad looking for a job five years ago. His friend Rajeev supported him financially and helped him in getting a driver’s job. Soon after, Jitendra started staying with his friend’s wife. A year back, the woman got separated from her husband. When she started living with Jitendra, she also took her two children along,” said Naresh Kumar Singh, SHO, Masuri police station. An FIR has been registered against Rajeev and an unknown person under Section 302 (punishment of murder) of the IPC. "

I have been on social media since I was 14. I enjoy it. The good side is, me being an actor, I can reach out to a lot more people. I can interact with fans and give them an insight into my life, which they wouldn’t have got otherwise as it’s an unfiltered version that I am providing. I also follow a lot of people who I look up to and it also helps me to keep in touch with my friends. It just makes the world smaller.” Ananya however cautions that people only post filtered versions about their lives, which makes everything seem perfect on social media. “People don’t post their failures, but you should realise that not everything is perfect and you shouldn’t believe everything you see. I provide the most real version of myself because I don’t want to set unrealistic expectations for young girls following me. I know how easy it is get carried away. If I am following someone, and I see a bag or a certain look that I want, I start feeling insecure about my appearance. Now, since I am an actor, I have a responsibility. I want to inspire those who are following me, and make them feel that we are real and normal.” Ananya posing for selfies with the girls (IBCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Ananya posing for selfies with the girls (IBCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Ananya at IT College (IBCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Ananya at IT College (IBCCL/ Aditya Yadav) And it wasn't just Ananya speaking at the event.

Lucknow,How Kuldeep Sengar’s clout increased with every state election,"LUCKNOW: The BJP may have sacked Bangarmau MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar on charges of rape and for his role in the recent truck-car collision in which the rape survivor has been critically injured, but there has been no let-up in the Rajput leader’s clout in Unnao. In fact, the vote share of the four-time MLA has witnessed a dramatic upswing since he made his electoral foray — from 24% in 2002 to 43% in the last assembly elections in 2017. In 2002, Sengar was one of the few Rajputs to get a BSP ticket and he didn’t disappoint his benefactor either. According to Election Commission data, he won Unnao with a vote share of over 24% while the BSP bagged three out of the five seats in Unnao district. This was also the first time that BSP won the Unnao Sadar seat. Sengar’s vote share increased to 28% when he won Bangarmau in 2007 assembly polls on an SP ticket. Four of the five seats — Unnao, Bhagwantnagar, Purwa, Safipur and Bangarmau — went to SP that year. In 2012, the MLA once again contested on an SP ticket and won from Bhagwantnagar with a 33% vote share. The SP bagged five of the six assembly seats in Unnao, as by then, Mohan had also become a part of Unnao parliamentary seat. Finally, in 2017, Sengar joined the BJP and won Bangarmau with an overwhelming 43% votes. The BJP bagged all the six assembly seats. Not surprisingly, his clout among voters in the district made Sakshi Maharaj, the BJP MP from the constituency, visit him at Sitapur jail where he has been lodged for a year and a half on charges of rape of a minor and death of her father in police custody. CM Yogi too shared dais with Sengar’s wife Sangeeta during a campaign in the Lok Sabha polls. The Sengar family has a strong political background. Sangeeta happens to be the chairperson of Unnao zila panchayat while Sengar’s younger brother Atul’s wife Archana is the gram pradhan of Makhi. “He (Sengar) has been a four-time MLA in succession. He can win an election from any assembly seat in Unnao,” said a senior BJP leader. Though the SP and the BSP have been turning vocal against Sengar amid the current controversy, they have also enjoyed his clout in Unnao, an expert added. "

Ghaziabad,"Sanjay Nagar, Knowledge Park air was worst this week","NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: The Knowledge Park V area in Greater Noida and Sanjay Nagar area in Ghaziabad have emerged as the most polluted spots, reveals a study. Track the pollution level in your cityThe Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has collected air quality data from several stations in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. It had installed new AQI machines in January with the help of CPCB funding. TOI curated data from the stations over five days — from July 31 to August 4. It found that Knowledge Park V in Greater Noida was in moderate category with AQI consistently above 100. Sanjay Nagar in Ghaziabad also displayed moderate AQI for one day, but showers ensured it improved to satisfactory. Officers at UPPCB blamed Knowledge Park V’s poor AQI on low rainfall. “It has been a trend for Greater Noida that it receives less rainfall than Noida. It can be because of a wind pattern locally which bypasses parts of the city. While AQI for most of Noida has reduced, parts of Greater Noida continue to be in the higher range of pollution,” Utsav Sharma, environmental engineer with UPPCB, Greater Noida, said. While AQI in Knowledge Park V area was 138 on July 31, it reduced to 104 on August 4, showing some sign of improvement since last week. Knowledge Park III area in Greater Noida also displayed high AQI over the last few days, starting with 96 on July 31, and reducing to 62 on August 4. Overall, Greater Noida’s AQI improved by an average 30 points during rains in the last few days. Meanwhile, Noida’s pollution levels in certain pockets seem to have risen over the last five days. The most polluted areas are sectors 1 and 62. While Sector 1 is at the intersection of Noida and Delhi, and regular traffic congestion in the area is a contributing factor to the air quality, Sector 62 is an industrial area. "
Lucknow,It took a lot of time and effort to convince my mother that I am not dating Mallika: Sumedh,"Making their debut visit to Lucknow, Sumedh Mudgalkar and Mallika Singh seemed completely in awe of the city. ""There are some places that you wish to visit and have been longing to, and Lucknow happens to be one of them for me!"" shared Sumedh, who was last seen in the serial 'Chakravartin Ashoka Samrat'. He adds, ""I am really happy to see so much greenery in the city. There’s a different kind of peace here altogether. It has very humble abodes and some beautiful buildings. I saw the Ambedkar Park here and was in complete awe of it. It is very pleasing to see the simplicity of this city."" Sumedh’s co-actress on the show 'RadhaKrishn', Mallika also loved Lucknow. ""Lucknow is a beautiful city. I’ve heard many praises for the food and places here. Since I have especially turned vegetarian for the show that I’m working on, I won’t be able to try the non-vegetarian food here but I’m sure it’s delicious, I’ve been hearing about it all along."" Not knowing much about the city though, Sumedh said, ""If it wasn’t for the time constraint, I would love to see the city properly."" Playing Radha in her debut serial, the 18-year-old actress, revealed that she has turned vegetarian just to get into the skin of her character. ""I know when actors and actresses these days do mythological shows they do not make any changes in their real life. I mean so many actors have retained their personalities and the way of dressing while playing gods and goddesses, but I didn’t want to eat non-vegetarian. Just realising the sentiments and feelings of the people who probably look up to us as gods, fans who come to us and literally worship us with so much love and aspiration makes me want to give up non-vegetarian. I feel I owe it to them,"" says she, adding, ""Before doing this show, I was very lethargic. I would sleep a lot, but then I didn’t realize how much I’ll have to slog for this show. We work day and night. We hardly get four hours of sleep. There are times when I fall sick too, but work goes on. It has been a learning experience though. The show has really helped me grow as a person. When I look back at the journey from when I started, it has been nothing less than wonderful.""

I always wanted to act. At the age of 15, just like everyone else, I came into this industry to become a hero. But my destiny was such that I was given the role of a villain instead. I obviously couldn’t have refused to play the role as the show was a big one. So, I convinced myself to play the role of the villain just as well as I would play the role of a hero. That’s when I understood that it wasn’t about playing a hero or a villain, but playing your character well, that’s the objective, to play your part well, whatever that may be. The deeper you feel your character, the better it will come out,"" he shares. Ask Sumedh, who plays Krishna, if he has tried to copy any of the actors who have played the character previously and he says, “I watched the work of all the actors who have played the role of Krishna, to help me build my character for the show. Right from Nitish Bharadwaj ji to to Saurabh Jain, I would notice how all these actors have played Krishna so beautifully."" Known for their on-screen chemistry on the show, Sumedh and Mallika are rumoured to be dating each other in real life too. In fact, the couple was recently offered to participate in a dance reality show which they turned down. “We are really happy that the audience has loved our on-screen chemistry. We’re playing the lead characters on a show, so but obviously, out of five scenes, three scenes involve our presence. And in turn, the bond will naturally show on screen. But we’re not dating,” says Sumedh, to which Mallika adds, ""A lot of work has actually gone behind building this kind of chemistry since we’re portraying the eternal love story of the iconic Radha Krishna. We have known each other for four years now, done so many workshops together. Our bond has been built over time. Sumedh is a close friend of mine. Besides I’m just concentrating on work right now, haven’t really given dating him or anyone a thought as of yet,"" said the actress. But the linkup rumours do affect Sumedh’s family, the actor revealed. ""My mother, who lives in Pune, got worried and asked about the rumours she had been reading in newspapers about our affair. Now imagine, I’ve been away from my mother for so many years. She, although understands how often these kinds of things are said about artistes, but she actually got worried. It took a lot of time and effort to convince my mother that I am not dating Mallika,"" says Sumedh. Ask the two about their future projects and Mallika shares, ""I feel scared honestly about what the future holds. I don’t know what kind of work I will get after this. I’m personally interested in mythology and fantasy a lot. I, however, hope I get a role in a mythological, historical or fantasy show after this show."" Sumedh, on the other hand, has worked in three Marathi films previously, one of which, titled 'Ventilator', had superstar Priyanka Chopra as a producer on board along with a short cameo by the global icon. ""I’ve recently finished shooting for another Marathi film, other than that I’m concentrating on RadhaKrishn for now."" – Akash.Wadhwa@timesgroup.com and Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,Lucknow akhada where religious rift bites dust,"LUCKNOW: Amid loud chants of ‘Jai Bajrangbali’ and ‘Ali Baba ki Jai’, the akhada at Chowk’s Mahanarayan Bagh came alive on Monday as 20-odd pehelwans (wrestlers) showcased their dangal (grappling) skills to mark the occasion of Nag Panchami. While most wrestling rings in the city have made way for swanky gymnasiums, this akhada that embodies Lucknow’s Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb has stood the test of time. It is a symbol of communal harmony and, most importantly, a place where the shrines of both Bajrangbali and Hazrat Ali are found. Aptly known as Ali-Mahabali akhada, the ring has been in existence for 61 years and on every Nag Panchami, it puts to test the skills of both Hindu and Muslim wrestlers. Prayers are offered to Bajrangbali or Hanuman — the guardian deity of rural grapplers — as well as Hazrat Imam Ali, the first Shia imam and the fourth Islamic caliph, before every duel. Traditional akhadas here began gaining ground around the 18th century during the period of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, the fourth Nawab Wazir of Awadh. The Ali-Mahabali akhada wrestling hub was started by Lucknow resident Gomti Prasad in 1958. Prasad believed in solidarity and had respect for both communities, recalls head priest Kamala Shankar Awasthi. The two shrines were built to celebrate the Sanskrit phrase, ‘Vasudhaiva kutumbakam (the world is one family)’, he said. “Our Awadhi tradition is a reflection of syncretism; in other words, a fusion of Hindu and Muslim cultures. When the two shrines share a common yard, it means we do not believe in discrimination. For wrestlers who come here, the chant of Bajrangbali and Ali hold equal significance,” said the priest who has been co-ordinating the dangal matches for 55 years now. The akhada today is an incubation centre for aspiring wrestlers. The famous Dara Singh is said to have flaunted his skills here on a certain Nag Panchami. “This is the only traditional akhada in the city, apart from the one in Ganeshganj. It is run by our association and also receives some financial support from the state government,” said Anurag Mishra, one of the organisers. Historian Yogesh Praveen said the “ritual of kushti or wrestling” was patronised by the nawabs. “If you go back in history, you will find that the tradition is only prevalent in the region.” "
Kanpur,How Mookerjee’s push against Art 370 became an article of faith for BJP,"If the scrapping of Article 370 has all along been among the BJP’s top priorities, it is because of the sharp spotlight cast on the contentious topic by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, founder of the BJP’s political precursor, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Mookerjee not only launched an agitation against a separate Sadr-e-Riyasat (head of state), a separate flag and a State Constitution for J&amp;K in 1952 but popularized the slogan Ek desh mein do vidhan (two Constitutions), do nishan (two flags) aur do pradhan (two heads of state) nahin chalenge.’ Son of a famous Calcutta high court judge, Mookerjee entered the Bengal legislative council in his 20s and became vice-chancellor of Calcutta University at age 33. When he met V D Savarkar at N C Chatterji’s home in 1939, he decided to join the Hindu Mahasabha, later succeeded Savarkar as its chief and in 1947 became one of three non-Congress nominees in free India’s first Cabinet. As industries minister in the Nehru regime and after he quit the ministry in 1950, Mookerjee received a slew of complaints from the Hindus of J&amp;K, who drew his attention to “violation of civil rights” by the Kashmir government led by Sheikh Abdullah and to alleged separatist tendencies fomented by the state’s leadership. On forming his own party, Jana Sangh, in 1951, Mookerjee said that Article 370, which gave the Centre powers in J&amp;K only in terms of defence, foreign affairs and communications, placed serious limits on the state’s accession to India and urged that provisions of the Indian Constitution such as those on fundamental rights, citizenship and other key matters be extended to the state.

Lucknow,"Rs 22 lakh exotic goats for Eid, Lucknow trader makes a killing","LUCKNOW: City-based trader Abdul Kareem hit a jackpot last weekend when he received Rs 22 lakh for three Sojat goats, an exotic breed from Rajasthan that he groomed in his farm in Kakori. While a Bhopal businessman bought a pair for Rs 15 lakh for sacrifice this Bakrid on August 12, the third one was purchased by another customer for Rs 7 lakh. Found in the arid region of Rajasthan, the Sojat goats are reared mainly for their meat because their milk yield is low. Kareem bought the three for Rs 70,000 each around 18 months ago and made special arrangements to raise them. The goats were fed meals comprising wheat, barley, chick peas, oats and gram, all prescribed by vets; their hair was periodically trimmed; and they were given daily massage that was followed by two hours of nap. “When we brought the animals here, they were around four months old and weighed around 17-18kg. Their weight increased to 210-220kg following the special grooming. Three persons were hired for the purpose,” Kareem said. The trader added, “Each goat consumes 5kg of cattle feed at a time. Liver tonic was given after every meal for better digestion. This breed was raised in Lucknow for the first time because it demands special attention.” In the past, Kareem has reared other exotic breeds such as Alvar, Babri, Barbari, Totapari and Ajmeri. They, however, are low-maintenance compared to the Sojat. A Barbari weighs around 80-90kg and is sold at Rs 1.6 lakh while the Alvar, Totapari and Ajmeri fetch anything between Rs 1.7 lakh and Rs 2 lakh. "
Lucknow,Green corridors &amp; airlift get Unnao survivor to AIIMS,"NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: The Unnao rape survivor who had been battling for life in the trauma centre of King George’s Medical University was flown from Lucknow to Delhi in an air ambulance on Monday evening for treatment in AIIMS following a directive by the Supreme Court earlier in the day. Two green corridors were created in Lucknow and Delhi to ensure speedy transfer of the survivor, who was critically injured along with her lawyer in an accident on July 28 when her car was hit by a truck in the Rae Bareli district. The air ambulance landed in Delhi from Lucknow airport at 9pm. By 9.18pm, the survivor had reached AIIMS, where she was taken to the ICU in the trauma centre. In Lucknow, it took 39 minutes to transport the survivor from the trauma centre to Chaudhary Charan Singh airport. Over 150 cops were deployed to create the green corridor through 22 crossings. “An ASP, two COs, six SHOs, four traffic inspectors and 142 constables were deployed for the exercise,” Lucknow district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said. He added that the survivor’s lawyer would be shifted to AIIMS on Tuesday. Earlier, a Supreme Court bench of justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose ordered that the survivor be airlifted from Lucknow to Delhi after her lawyer D Ramakrishna Reddy said that the family members had agreed to the apex court’s suggestion that she be shifted to AIIMS for better treatment. The bench in the morning deferred the hearing for Friday after no one appeared for her and her family but later Reddy appeared and told the bench that her family wanted her to be shifted to AIIMS as she continued to be critical. Before the survivor left KGMU, a medical bulletin said her condition had improved. She opened her eyes and is following commands. The lawyer has been taken off ventilator, but is still in coma.

Officials later opened it and found Madhuri Singh’s Aadhaar card. “It was an incredibly lucky day for us. We were carrying the money to deposit it in the bank. My wife forgot to collect the bag after security check and we realised it was missing only after boarding the train to Indiranagar,” said Arun Kumar. The couple profusely thanked the LMRC for its prompt help. “Officials contacted us without delay and told us to reach Munshipulia station. After necessary formalities, the bag was returned to us,” Kumar added. "
Lucknow,Third jolt for Samajwadi Party: Sanjay Seth quits RS,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party MP Sanjay Seth resigned from the Rajya Sabha on Monday. Seth is the third SP MP to quit the Upper House since July 15. While SP MP Neeraj Shekhar had resigned from the Rajya Sabha on July 15, another MP, Surendra Nagar, quit on August 2. Like Neeraj, who has joined the BJP, Surendra and Sanjay, too, are expected to enter the saffron fold soon. While Surendra is a leading milk and ghee businessman of west UP, Sanjay Seth is a top builder of UP. The resignations are being seen as a blow to the SP as the three MPs had their own standing in the party. While Neeraj Shekhar, son of former PM Chandrashekhar, is popular in Ballia, Surendra Nagar is an influential Gujjar leader of west UP. Besides handling the financial matters of SP as the national treasurer, Sanjay Seth is considered close to the Yadav clan. With Seth's exit, SP is now left with just 10 members in the Rajya Sabha. House chairman Venkaiah Naidu informed the House about the resignations of Seth and Nagar on Monday. Naidu added that he had accepted the resignations with immediate effect after verifying their handwriting and statements that there was no rethinking on their part on the issue. Naidu also informed the House about the resignation of Congress chief whip, Bhubaneshwar Kalita, from the House. Kalita is the second Congress MP to have resigned from the Upper House after Sanjay Sinh. "
Ghaziabad,"Two Ghaziabad men catch fleeing robbers, shot","GHAZIABAD: Two persons were killed and another is battling for life in hospital after being shot by a gang of robbers that had barged into a house in Tronica City early on Monday morning. The 3am robbery took place in the single-storey house of Dharamveer in Pooja Colony. Dharamveer, who suffered three bullet injuries, died on the spot. He had moved to Ghaziabad in 2008 from his hometown in Badaun and had been living there with his wife and three children. Neighbours said Dharamveer had been sleeping outside his house ever since the shutter of his shop started malfunctioning a few days ago. Dharamveer had turned the front portion of his house into a grocery store and it led to the rooms inside. On Monday, he was sleeping on a cot as usual when two men woke him up and asked for water to drink. After hesitating initially, Dharamveer went inside to fetch a glass of water and at least eight men barged into the house, wielding guns. A few others stood guard outside. “Dharamveer’s wife and children woke up in the commotion. The gang ransacked the house for about 30 minutes, pointing a gun at the family members all the while. When they were about to leave, Dharamveer caught one of the robbers, who fired at him,” SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said. The officer said Dharamveer was hit by two bullets in the neck and one in the chest. He died before being taken to the hospital. The gunshots woke up brothers Sonu and Babu Verma in the adjacent building, and they rushed out of their house to see what had happened. As the gang started running towards the main road, Sonu caught one of the robbers by the nape. The gang fired a few shots at the two brothers. Sonu was hit twice in the chest and succumbed to injuries on the way to GTB Hospital in Delhi. His younger brother Babu, who suffered a bullet injury in the stomach, is admitted in the ICU of the hospital. “The bodies of Dharamveer and Sonu have been sent for autopsy and the reports are awaited,” Jadaun said. On the basis of a complaint by Dharamveer’s wife, an FIR has been registered against unknown persons under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 457 (house trespass or house breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the IPC at Tronica City police station. Police said preliminary investigation suggested that the gang had prior knowledge of the area and knew there are no CCTV cameras there. “They did not even bother to cover their faces. We are checking footage from cameras installed in a nearby petrol pump and along the roads,” the SP (rural) said. Four teams have been formed to nab the accused. Dharamveer’s family claimed that the gang took away Rs 30,000 in cash and jewellery worth Rs 1.3 lakh. Sonu, one of the brothers who died, is survived by his wife and a 1-year-old son. He worked as a clerk in a plastic manufacturing company in Ghaziabad. His younger brother Babu runs a mobile phone shop in the area. Residents complained of rising instances of crime. Ranjana Singh, a neighbour of Dharamveer, said robberies had become quite common in the colony and accused police of slack patrolling. “Police have not been able to control the crime rate in the area. They are not even patrolling on all days. We have made repeated requests to the police to intensify vigil, but to no avail. The latest robbery is the fallout of slack policing,” she said. "

The CM set a deadline of October 31 for the completion of projects, failing which not only will the corporation be blacklisted, but its officials will also be jailed. While reviewing the working of the medical education department on Monday, Yogi also expressed displeasure with construction and design services wing of the UP Jal Nigam. He also rapped the power department for “poor quality of work” in electrification of the medical colleges. “Those lines where losses are being reported should be given to private companies. The government will carry out an investigation into charges of corruption against some engineers,” he said. Yogi further said officials on key posts should not be transferred frequently and accountability should be fixed. “Those deployed on important positions should be allowed to continue for full term. Project managers should also be at their place of posting, not in Lucknow,” the CM said. Five medical colleges coming up with central aid and are part of the first phase of implementation.

Lucknow,Hima Das should compete with good athletes and improve her timing to win an Olympic medal: PT Usha in Lucknow,"PT Usha needs no introduction. The woman who reigned over the tracks for more than two decades and was popularly called the queen of Indian track and field was in the city to attend a private event. In an exclusive chat with us, Padma Shri PT Usha talked about India’s chances in 2020 Tokyo Olympics, advise for Hima Das to improve her performance, her biopic and her connect with the city. Talking about her Lucknow connect, the golden girl shares she has been to the city many times before. Reminiscing her days in the city, she says, ""I love Lucknow! I love the people here and like to be here. I used to often come here back in the 80s and 90s and I still have many friends here. I remember staying in Guru Gobind Singh Sports College for a couple of months and doing training with the boys there, under Bhatia sir."" After winning five gold medals in various races in Europe last month, Hima Das is being pitched as one of the strong contenders in the Olympics next year. Also known as Payyoli Express, PT Usha has a word of caution for the Dhing Express, ""If she wants a better performance next year, then she should start participating in some big championships, as the championships she has participated in so far are, in the lower rungs on the World Championship ranking points system. Competing only against Indian in these championships is not going to improve her performance. Instead, she should run with international athletes to not only asses her performance but also improve on the lacunae. A lot of money is being spent on them for their training outside the country but when it comes to the list of athletes participating in foreign championships, out of 8, 7 are Indian. So, that is not good. If she improves, she has strong chances of winning an Olympic medal."" Still pinning her hopes on Hima Das and Neeraj Chopra (former World Junior Javelin Champion) in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, PT Usha, despite being skeptical, feels India has fair chances of winning gold medals next year. ""Lot of time is still there, we can’t asses now because Neeraj Chopra was doing well, he has an injury now, Hima Das did well by clocking 50 plus timing but she has not qualified for Olympics yet. So, we should wait for some more time and I am hopeful that India will deliver good performance in the Olympics next year,"" she says. PT Usha (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)  PT Usha (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Ask her about, what potential UP has when it comes to athletics and she is quick to respond, ""Sudha (Singh) is doing well and there have been many good athletes in the past also. So, I think the state has a lot of potential."" Quiz her about a UP athlete winning gold in Olympics in the near future and she replies, ""I think the younger generation has the talent to deliver good performance at the highest level."" PT Usha, in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics missed the bronze medal in the 400m finals by 1/100th of a second. Ask her how athletics has changed since then, and she shares, “Not much. The best timings of the athletes over the years are nearly the same as they were 35 years back. But the facilities have very much improved as compared to our time. Today, they get training abroad also and attend several camps outside the country. I saw the synthetic track when I went to Moscow and at that time only three synthetic tracks were there in India. But today, I think every state has it.” She feels that despite so much improvement in the infrastructure and facilities, the performance of players over the years have remained the same. Pointing out what more needs to be done, she says, ""We need more Indian coaches to come up instead of only foreign coaches. We should encourage them and support them facility wise so that they hone the skills of Indian players in a better way. There are many world records held by American players, so if you really want to get a foreign coach then get a good one or if they are not ready to send them, send the players to the US. Since 1999, we have been having foreign coaches, especially for athletics, but how many medals we have won, none! In our time we had no foreign coach but still, we reached near the big medal."" The Kerala athlete is now training 19 youngsters at her academy back in the state. Quiz her about the government support to athletes and she replies in a rather dismal way, ""If you compare to our time, then yes the government is supporting sportspersons. But not all are getting equal facilities in athletics, you can say some 400 relay teams and maybe Javelin teams are getting all the facilities and not others. Take the example of Jisna Mathews, who was the youngest girl after me to participate in the Olympics. She not only participated in many big championships but won gold medals also and she ranks fourth currently after Hima Das and VK Vismaya. That girl is not in TOP (Target Olympic Podium) scheme nor Khelo India scheme for youngsters. Like her, many deserving players will be there. So, it means worthy players are not getting the benefit of these government schemes. There is some fault in the system."" With so many sports biopics being made, a film on her life was also very much expected. Being directed by Revathy S Varmah, the film is all set to go on floors. ""I think most of the things have been finalized and the shoot will start very soon,"" says Usha. On being quizzed on whom she would like to play her role in the biopic, she candidly replies, ""I don’t have any particular actress in mind but copying my running style and all will be very difficult. She should have done some creditable work before and her attitude should be like mine. And then, of course, she will have to be sincere and be able to put in a lot of hard work in it because my journey was very tough. I want other athletes to get inspired by my story and win Olympic medals."" "

In the oncology department, Virendra Kumar Verma (64), who had come with his son Ajay Kumar (39), said, “My son had an appointment for chemotherapy today but after waiting for six hours, I am going back.” Rambhajan (47), waiting outside the OPD building with his daughter Aarti (22), said, “I came from Kushinagar four days ago with Rs 5,500 to get my daughter treated for paralysis. KGMU trauma centre asked me to shift Aarti to RMLIMS but doctors here are on strike. Now, I am going to Civil hospital. Every time, the ambulance charges around Rs 500. How will we survive if our savings are spent on shifting hospitals?” TimesViewWhile grievances of doctors and medical staff are concerning, such strikes affect patients the most. Many of these patients travel for hours and spend money to reach these government hospitals. If a strike is planned in advance, the hospital must work on a mechanism to make an announcement well in time so that patients can make alternative arrangements and avoid situations like protests.Most of the patients waiting outside had come from other districts in the hope of better treatment. Kripa Shankar (35), who had come with his mother Usha Devi (61) from Jaunpur, said, “Doctors said my mother has an infection in multiple organs. However, there is no doctor to admit her now. We are going back to Jaunpur to admit her there.” Director RMLIMS AK Tripathi said, “We convinced the staff to call off the strike around 3pm. No casualty was reported during the strike.” "

He said if Article 370 was responsible for poor development of Jammu and Kashmir, then the Centre should explain the backwardness of Uttar Pradesh. “I will be happy if Jammu and Kashmir develops, but I want to know if UP has been cheated despite the Prime Minister, President, Governor, you (Speaker) being from there, how can one say Kashmir won’t meet a similar fate,” Akhilesh Yadav asked in Lok Sabha. “You say no development happened in Kashmir in 70 years since independence. That means you are including 11 years that you (BJP) were in power,” he added. He also cornered the government for only focusing on Kashmir’s special status. “The government must answer the status of Pak-occupied Kashmir. And why we have not been able to fill 24 seats (from PoK) still vacant in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly? Can the home minister assure us these seats will be filled,” he said. "
Lucknow,CRRI experts assist CBI in crash probe,"LUCKNOW: Following the Supreme Court directive to complete the Rae Bareli car crash probe within a week, the CBI has roped in experts from the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) for assistance in investigation. A four-member team of experts from CRRI’s traffic safety division reached Rae Bareli on Monday and inspected the crash site in Gurubakshganj area along with the CBI team to uncover the truth behind the July 28 collision between the car carrying Unnao rape survivor and the truck. CRRI, a premier institute engaged in research and development on design, construction and maintenance of roads, traffic and transportation, had also assisted Delhi Police in investigation of then Union minister Gopinath Munde’s death in a car crash in New Delhi in 2014. A senior officer privy to the probe said, “The experts took measurements at the accident site to determine whether the location where the crash took place is a ‘black spot’. The team of experts will also take note of the behavioural pattern of driver.” One of the CRRI experts, on condition of anonymity, told TOI, “Several dimensions are involved in an accident like this one in Rae Bareli. We have taken note of geometrical dimensions of the roads. Now, the driving skills of the driver would be tested in similar conditions.” “We will also check the braking speed of the vehicles, and the air-pressure in tyres of the truck in given weather conditions before arriving at a conclusion. The sequence of events after the accident and any such accidents of past on the same stretch will also be examined,” the expert added. A CBI officer in the probe team said, “The findings of CRRI would be matched with the report of CFSL to conclude whether it was an ‘accident’ or planned attack.” The CFSL has already collected and analysed evidence, including damage to the car, truck and tyre marks.

Lucknow,"Forced to leave without chemo session, rues patient at KGMU","LUCKNOW: Services in the new out-patient department (OPD) of King George’s Medical University (KGMU) were disrupted for at least two hours on Tuesday morning due to a strike by resident doctors and employees. The doctors and paramedic staff of KGMU went on strike demanding salaries on a par with that in SGPGI. Patients queued up in the OPDAccording to officials, on an average, 4,000 patients come to KGMU OPD daily. Of these, around 1,200 are new registrations and the rest are follow-ups. Hundreds of patients coming from far-off places went through a harrowing day waiting for the resident doctors and employees to get back on work. When TOI visited KGMU on Tuesday, long queues were seen at the OPD registration counters. As patients got to know about the strike, many had no option but to return. Some patients, however, took shelter on the floor in front of registration counters. Anoop Shukla, a patient from Sitapur, said, “I came here at 6am and have been waiting in front of the registration counter. It has been three hours but no one has come here.” Many, however, said they did not have the luxury of coming back a day later. Rahul Pal, a patient from Balrampur, said, “I came here for chemotherapy which was scheduled for this week. I have spent a lot of money in travelling to Lucknow and being away from work. Now, I am only sitting here disappointed.” The president of the employees’ association at KGMU Vikas Singh said, “We had stopped our work for just two hours. All employees and resident doctors went back to work after getting assurance from the chief superintendent that authorities will look into the matter.” "

Lucknow,Police on hunt for rape accused spark Ganj high drama,"LUCKNOW: Shooting outside a lounge still fresh in memory, Hazratganj was in for another shock on Tuesday evening when commuters spotted a group holding a man ‘hostage’ and training guns at him and his wife. What seemed like a case of kidnapping or at least criminal intimidation turned out to be one of routine policing when one among the group flashed an ID, much to the relief of the terrified crowd that had gathered around. The armed men were actually plainclothes policemen from Kannauj who were arresting a man wanted for rape. They were soon joined by a team from Hazratganj police station. The accused was taken into custody, but not before a video clip went viral. Hazratganj SHO Radha Raman Singh said the Kannauj police team came to Lucknow to arrest Dinesh Gupta, the owner of a school wanted for raping a minor student. He had been on the run for weeks and police were tracking his mobile phone. On Tuesday, Gupta’s phone location showed Hazratganj and cops in civvies followed him there. He came out of his four-wheeler and was about to board another car when they caught him. His wife started screaming kidnap, prompting the policemen to bring out their service pistols to stop Gupta from escaping. Kannauj SP Amrendra Singh confirmed the covert operation. He told TOI that Gupta was on the run since June after a rape FIR was lodged against him at Saurikh police station. A non-bailable warrant was also issued. Saurikh SHO Raj Kumar Singh told TOI that Gupta had last November, asked the school maid to bring the girl to his room, where he allegedly raped her. He targeted her again in January and April . "
Lucknow,"Invest in LMC public bonds for Lucknow facelift, earn interest","LUCKNOW: Come October, you can invest in the city’s development and earn good money at the same time. The Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) has decided to raise Rs 200 crore for various projects in the city by issuing public bonds. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said they had received the go-ahead from the state government, and terms and conditions of the scheme were being finalised. “We have got the nod and work is on to finalise the scheme.” The bonds are expected to be issued from mid-October and can be purchased only from the LMC’s head office in Lalbagh. The money will be used to develop parking lots, make advertising slots and raise residential and commercial projects. “These projects will bring revenue through rent or sale, which will then be shared with investors. The model is based on a scheme implemented by Pune Municipal Corporation,” an LMC official said. An individual can invest up to Rs 50 lakh. The civic body will create two accounts for every investor. The principal money will come to the first account in equal monthly instalments while the interest will be deposited in the second account. Interest at a rate of at least 2% on the principal amount is likely to be paid only after the LMC starts generating Rs 19 crore revenue a month. This may take around a year, officials said. The fine points and modalities of the scheme will be finalised at an LMC executive committee meeting scheduled in September. "
Kanpur,IIT Kanpur to provide AI-based tech for the protection and conservation of UP wildlife,"BAREILLY: IIT Kanpur and the UP forest department have joined hands for technological solutions to protect and conserve forest, wildlife and bio-diversity in Uttar Pradesh. A team of 3D LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) mapping and artificial intelligence experts from IITK paid a visit to have a first-hand feel of constraints faced by frontline staff. Feedback was collected from staff and prototypes of new technology were demonstrated for their benefit. LiDAR is a remote sensing survey method that measures distance to a target by illuminating it with laser light, and measuring the reflected light with a sensor. This included demonstration of ‘tree stock’ mapping using LiDAR in Sonaripur range of Dudhwa national park, which can detect the amount of biomass and wood, illegal actions and fire in forests. This technology can also be helpful for modelling moving objects in the forest. Divulging details about the brief stay of IIT experts at Dudhwa, field director Sanjay Pathak said, “The experts arrived earlier this week and spent a few days at the reserve meeting officials and collecting information about challenges they face. Professor Salil Goel and his team demonstrated the use of 3D LiDAR in the mapping of forest and recording various parameters of trees, such as density, diameter, height and numbers.” “Professor Nishchal K Verma and his research students demonstrated advanced algorithms for AI-based event-triggered machine vision technology for animals, using thermal and vision cameras in day and night, for timely assistance. This technology is helpful for identification and counting of animals, behavioural study and analysis, generation of alerts for timely assistance to rescue injured animals, and intelligent data analysis for knowledge generation. The technology was demonstrated in Salukapur campus under South Sonaripur Range, in the presence of deputy directors and range officers,” he added. Pathak further said, “The experts have returned to Kanpur with a realistic view of constraints we face and first-hand experience, based on which they would be able to suggest suitable technological solutions. If everything goes right, Dudhwa will soon have AI-based monitoring system.” Deputy director (buffer) Anil Patel said, “The biggest challenge in buffer areas is the risk of man-animal conflict. We’ve asked the IIT experts to help us in developing a system that will alert us, whenever a wild animal strays out of the forest. If we are alerted in time, it would minimise our response time and help in initiating their rescue at the earliest.” "
Ghaziabad,"UP-NCR, Gurugram have a tough time","NOIDA/GHAZIABAD/GURUGRAM: Three hours of rainfall on Tuesday brought life to a standstill in Ghaziabad and severely affected mobility in Noida and Greater Noida. The rain claimed at least four lives in Noida and Greater Noida and injured 13 people as parts of buildings collapsed in two areas. In Dubli village in Rabupura, a family was fast asleep on the first floor of their house when the ceiling came crashing on them at 9.30pm. Two children were crushed under iron beams and chunks from the ceiling. They died on the spot. The rest of the 10 members were sleeping on the same floor and were injured. The nightmare was repeated in Sirsa village of Greater Noida, where two people, including a seven-year-old boy died and a 50-year-old woman was severely injured when a part of a vacant house collapsed on them. In both Noida and Ghaziabad, the basements of many highrises were flooded with rainwater and several cave-ins were reported. In Indirapuram's Ahinsa Khand 2, a wall caved in around 11am. Other affected areas were Vaishali, Shyam Park and Kavinagar. Commuters faced snarls on Hapur-Meerut road, Mohan Nagar, GT Road and Ghantaghar Road. Rakesh Sharma, a resident of Indirapuram, said, ""I reach my office in Sihani Gate in 30 minutes but it took me over an hour to reach today.""  In Noida Extension, a major tragedy was averted when a large portion of the service road near Ekmurti roundabout caved in at 1pm where Saya SouthX mall is being constructed. ""Deep excavation work was being done by Saya group that damaged the service road in front of their plot. We have filed a complaint against the builder and penalised them for Rs 8 lakh,"" said KK Gupta, additional chief executive officer, GNIDA.

Ghaziabad,GDA set to list charges against 40 engineers,"GHAZIABAD: The probe report of a land allotment scam in which some government officials managed to transfer plots in a housing scheme floated by the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) in their names has named 40 people, all engineers with GDA departments posted between 2005 and 2017. The report, which is in the nature of a charge sheet and is being prepared by the GDA, will be submitted to the state government this month. Of the 40 officials named, three are executive engineers, 15 assistant engineers and 22 junior engineers. The investigation relates to the Swarn Jayanti Puram housing scheme that was launched by GDA in 1998. A total of Rs 1,553 plots (sizes of 200 square metres, 150 sqm, 112 sqm and 90 sqm) were carved out and put up for sale. But 139 allotments were cancelled as the investors defaulted on payment of EMIs. However, some officials, in connivance with middlemen and property dealers, got the allotments restored between 2005 and 2007 on behalf of the original allottees by asking them to pay a small amount. Later, the officials got the plots transferred in their own names. The plots were restored at the prevailing sector rate in 1998, which was between Rs 2,575 per sqm and Rs 2,820 per sqm. The rates were around rS 12,000 per sqm between the years 2005 and 2007. In 2007, Rajendra Tyagi, the councillor, first raised the issue. In 2011, he filed a public interest litigation in the Allahabad high court after GDA failed to take any action. In November 2017, the court directed the government to form a committee for a new investigation. A four-member panel formed under Moradabad commissioner RK Singh later submitted a report before court, indicting 19 people, including then GDA officials. GDA found 40 officials, who were posted here between 2005 and 2017, guilty and sent a report to the state government, which in turn issued show-cause notices to the accused officials. Not satisfied with the replies given by the officials, the government asked the GDA to prepare charge sheets and submit them. "

Lucknow,Won't provide info on 'kalpanik' RTI queries: UP government,"LUCKNOW: The government on Tuesday cleared amendments to the UP Right to Information Act 2015 and said it would not respond to any kalpanik queries. The government said it would only respond to questions, the details of which are in its records. ""We are bound to share only that information which is present in our files.

How can we share information, which is not mentioned in a file,"" government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said.

However, the use of the word kalpanik has raised doubts about what the government believes is fanciful or imaginary. RTI activists said it's understandable that an information which is not there can't be shared but the move should not be an attempt to conceal information. "
Lucknow,Lucknow Metro is keen to attract filmmakers: MD LMRC,"It was the first time ever that Bollywood celebrities got to go for a ride in the Lucknow Metro ever since it started in the city two years ago. Actors Gulshan Grover, Mahima Chaudhry and filmmaker Rahul Mittra took a ride in the Lucknow Metro on Saturday afternoon and giving them company was Kumar Keshav, Managing Director, Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation (LMRC).

It was really a very good gesture from their side. We had asked them a day before they were scheduled to visit Lucknow, if they would they like to ride in the Lucknow Metro to which they readily agreed. They were very appreciative and were mighty impressed by the artwork at the Hazratganj Metro station. It’s just the beginning and soon many stars will visit us.

And if someone feels he needs anything extra, we will be more than willing to help,"" said Kumar Keshav. He also added, ""I also want young stars who are quite popular today like Ayushmann Khurrana, Varun Dhawan to shoot in Lucknow Metro as they inspire many to achieve something big in life."" In the past, producer Amul Mohan had wanted to shoot portions of his film 'Behen Hogi Teri' with actors Rajkummar Rao and Shruti Hassan in the Lucknow Metro, but at that time he wasn’t granted permission for it. ""It’s been close to two years since the Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation (LMRC) released its first film policy for shooting at LMRC’s premises, including the stations and trains. But unfortunately, it has failed to find any takers,"" rues Keshav. ""Earlier we had only eight stations but now we have 21 stations, and the most beautifully designed section was inaugurated just four months back. So, I am hopeful that filmmakers will soon approach us. Till now, maybe the script of the films being shot in the city didn’t have such a scene to can in a Metro or else they would have approached us."" Keshav further informed us that the fees for shooting at the LMRC premises and properties is also quite nominal and is only for the actual time of the shooting.

Moderate rainfall for an hour turned roads into rivers in several parts of the state capital on Wednesday, reminding the civic authorities once more the urgent need to revamp the city's poor drainage system. Met officials have predicted similar weather until Sunday and commuters will do good to brush up their wading skills. Heavy waterlogging was witnessed in prominent areas like Hazratganj, Charbagh, Parivartan Chowk, Gomtinagar, Mahanagar, Nishatganj and Aliganj. In some pockets, the water was ankle-deep.

On August 3, 62-year-old Singh’s credit card transaction at a petrol bunk failed, but the money was anyway debited from his account. He tweeted a complaint along with his phone number and tagged his bank. On August 5, Singh received a call purportedly from an employee of the bank. The caller asked him to install an app and lodge his complaint afresh. Singh did as told and also shared his login ID with the caller before entering credit card details in the complaint box on the app. After sometime, he received an OTP and within a few hours, Rs 1.08 lakh was withdrawn from his bank savings account in six instalments. “I was a banker myself and I know that the OTP should not be shared with anyone. Here, I did not share the OTP and yet my money was gone,” the victim told TOI, adding that he had lodged a complaint with police cyber cell and the bank. Cyber cell in-charge Rahul Singh Rathore said while people were becoming aware about OTP safekeeping, conmen were innovating their modus operandi. “Cyber crooks are using commonly available remote login apps through which one can gain access to a person’s phone. People facing transaction problems through payment apps or credit/debit cards are soft targets. The conmen call them posing as bank employees or digital wallet company representative and swindle them out of money,” Rathore explained. Computer operator in a private firm, 32-year-old Srivastava was conned out of Rs 61,500 after he lodged a complaint at the customer care centre of an e-wallet company following transaction issues during phone bill payment. The money was deducted from his digital wallet, but did not reach the phone service provider. “A few minutes after I lodged the complaint, I received a call from a man who identified himself as a representative of the e-wallet company. He asked me to install an app and share the login ID. Within minutes, I lost the money from my account,” Srivastava told TOI. Rathore warned that the remote login allows a cyber crook to access all other app installed on a target’s phone. “He may see/send messages from WhatsApp or have access to social media accounts. However, we have not received any such complaint.” "
Lucknow,"Curbing stray dog count in Lucknow: Now, help to come from US","LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Municipal Corporation has decided to entrust a US-based nonprofit with the task to neuter or spay stray dogs in the city at LMC’s new sterilisation centre in Gomtinagar. The centre is equipped to conduct the procedures on 1,500 dogs every month. Currently, only 60 are covered a month while the LMC complaint cell, on an average, receives 35 calls about dog bites or accidents because of strays. While the civic authorities are sanguine that the initiative will curb the burgeoning canine population, the task is a Herculean one given that Lucknow has 60,000 stray dogs at the moment. Even if the new centre works non-stop, it will be another three years and four months before all the animals are either neutered or spayed. According to the agreement inked between the LMC and the US outfit, the latter will sterilise around 18,000 dogs a year for which the civic body will pay around Rs 60 lakh per annum. The NGO will also treat stray dogs injured in road accidents or those that are ill. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said the LMC would provide the NGO required infrastructure and vans to catch dogs. “It will have to bring its own manpower and equipment for sterilisation. We hope to see some difference in a year,” Tripathi added. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad abolishes circle rates in green belts, standardises it for parking","GHAZIABAD: For the third year in a row, the district administration has decided not to hike circle rates. Some anomalies, though, have been rectified — circle rates in green belts have been abolished and those for parking areas have been standardised across the district. Circle rate is the minimum value at which sale or transfer of property takes place. “The circle rates for 2019-20 will come into effect from Thursday and this time again they have not been hiked. They remain unchanged across the district,” KK Mishra, AIG, stamp and registration department, said, adding, “We found a few discrepancies which we have done away with this time.” In Ghaziabad, the circle rate of parking space is usually 3% of the area’s circle rate. “But in areas like Sadiq Nagar in Raj Nagar Extension, Rajender Nagar and a few others, we were charging 4%. It was putting unnecessary burden on buyers,” said Mishra. In areas like Sahibabad, Indirapuram, Vaishali, Ramprastha and Jawahar Park, which are under the jurisdiction of sub registrar 3, there was a provision under which circle rates of green belts were fixed at Rs 10,000/sqm. However, sale or purchase of property in green belts is not permitted. “Fixing circle rate in green belt was illogical as no one is allowed to buy property there as per an NGT order. We have removed this,” said Mishra. Circle rate in Kaushambi residential area will be between Rs 72,500/sqm and Rs 79,700/sqm. Rates under commercial head will vary from Rs 1,26,000/sqm to Rs 1,38,000/sqm. In Indirapuram, residential rates will be between Rs 66,500/sqm and Rs 73,100/sqm and commercial rates will be Rs 96,000/sqm to Rs 1,86,000/sqm. In Vasundhara, the rates under residential category are between Rs 56,500/sqm and Rs 62,100/sqm and between Rs 96000/sqm to Rs 1,20,000/sqm under commercial category. The revenue target set by the government from stamp duty for 2019-20 is Rs 1,626 crore as against Rs 1,442 crore in 2018-19. “In 2018-19, we were able to achieve about 88% of the target,” said Mishra.

Lucknow,DM seeks meeting with airlines as flights from Hindon stare at delay,"GHAZIABAD: The district administration on Wednesday held a meeting with Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials over the delay in starting commercial flight operations from the Hindon air force base. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey sought a meeting with three private airline operators. Pandey also urged AAI officials to include Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi and Gorakhpur among connecting cities. “We had hoped flight operations would begin from the Hindon terminal in August but that seems unlikely, so we held a meeting with AAI officials to know the reasons behind delay,” said Pandey. “The feeling that we got in the meeting was that private airline operators are somewhat wary of starting operations due to some reason. So I have sought meeting with at least three operators so that we can allay their apprehensions,” added Pandey. “We have also requested AAI to include four more cities Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi and Gorakhpur in the list of cities to where we want to start operations from Hindon domestic terminal,” Pandey said. As of now, there are eight cities — Hubli, Jamnagar, Faizabad, Pithoragarh, Shimla, Kalburgi, Kannur and Nashik — to where AAI has given a green signal for flight operations under the government’s subsidised regional air connectivity scheme, UDAN. In March this year, Prime Minister Narender Modi had inaugurated the civil terminal at Hindon IAF base. Flight operations were initially supposed to start by April, but were delayed. The AAI had earlier refused permission for flight operations at night out of safety concerns since the terminal is not properly fenced, due to which nilgai and other animals often stray into the airstrip. The administration has now secured the perimeter by fencing it. "

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Fix cracks in Crossings towers for completion papers, builder told","GHAZIABAD: Worried over cracks appearing in the pillars of all nine towers in the society, residents of GH-7 highrise apartments in Crossings Republik on Wednesday met Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) officials and raised the issue. GDA officer on special duty Sushil Kumar Choubey said the completion certificate will be issued to the society only after structural faults are rectified and other requisite norms fulfilled. He said the developer has assured the authority of getting the structural inspection done by IIT Roorkee and the faults rectified at the earliest. “The residents and the developer were both heard during the meeting. The developer has been asked to submit a time-frame under which it plans to get the inspection done by IIT Roorkee and faults rectified,” Choubey said. There are 1,980 flats in nine towers of the society, and nearly all of these have been occupied after possession first started in 2010-11. A resident claimed that the cracks first started appearing after an earthquake in 2012. Rohit Chaudhary, president of the GH-7 RWA, said, “For the past several years, we have been pursuing this matter with the Crossings Infra Private Ltd (CIPL), a group of private developers that provides and maintains basic amenities in the township for a monthly payment.” He added that in April, they were not informed about excavation of pits near tower 4, following which they had sought a clarification from CIPL. “We suspected that the work was related to retrofitting to strengthen the structure but we were not given any intimation by the consortium,” Chaudhary said. In June, a clarification was once again sought from CIPL through a letter by Crossings Republik Infrastructure Apartment Owners Association. It was stated that residents of the society were worried as the work, it seemed, was not part of regular maintenance, but a structural retrofitting. The association also sought to know the details of the agencies appointed to carry out the work. However, when they did not get a reply from CIPL, the residents complained to GDA. When contacted, Ishwar Tyagi, CIPL vice-president, said, “We have agreed to the directions and will submit the report in the stipulated time period. The concerns of the residents will be addressed.” "
Ghaziabad,‘Ban outsiders in society shopping complex’,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has issued a final notice to developers of four group housing societies in Raj Nagar Extension that have given outsiders access to shopping complexes meant for residents. Officials said these developers have been asked to start construction of a wall on the front side of their respective shopping complex within a week, else the licences of the societies will be cancelled for violation of building plans. In the notice, the GDA has made it clear that under the norms of the map approval, convenience shops are meant for the residents only. However, in violation of the terms of the map approval, no boundary wall has been built in front of the shopping complexes and they are being misused for commercial purpose. At present, a large number of people from nearby localities visit these complexes and in the absence of proper parking spaces, the visitors park their vehicles on the roadside causing traffic jams, the letter said. The GDA officials said that the convenience shops are meant to fulfil the daily needs of residents and according to the norms, one shop is sanctioned for every 200 residents. Using convenience shops for commercial purpose is a violation of land use, they said, adding the notices were issued to the developers in May and June this year, but no action was taken by them. "

The city will become a model for harvesting rainwater in the coming years."" "
Lucknow,When Sushma Swaraj played Cupid in cross-border marriages,"LUCKNOW: Pakistani national Sadia says she will remain indebted to Sushma Swaraj all her life. It was due to the late foreign minister’s prompt intervention that Sadia could marry her Lucknow-based lover and settle in India. Swaraj’s sudden demise has shattered Sadia.

Lucknow boy weds Pakistan girl finally, couple thanks Sushma SwarajLike her, many across the border and in UP thank the then foreign minister who repsonded to their pleas about a visa or even a passport. It was because of her intervention, mostly through Twitter, that they could be united with their loved ones. Sadia, 27, added, “I am in India because of Sushma ma’am. She was very ill when Shariq (my husband) and I tweeted to her about my visa problem. We did not get a reply as she was not active on social media at the time. But we got a call from the Indian high commission in Islamabad which swung into action on her perusal.” Minister who helped Lucknow boy marry Pakistani girl“The high commission helped settle my visa issue because she pushed it,” said Sadia, who has been happily living in Lucknow for the past two years. “Even then home minister Rajnath Singh had urged Sushma ma’am to expedite my visa process so that I could get married on the date fixed,” she said. “She was a person who considered many of us as her children. I am now scared about what would happen to my stay in India after her demise,” added Sadia. In another case, Swaraj played the Cupid when she helped Lucknow boy Naqi Ali Khan in tying the knot with his Pakistani fiancee Sabahat. Swaraj welcomed the girl as the “daughter-in-law” of India. “She was a brave woman who helped a lot of people like us. She was genuine in her concerns. India has lost a diamond,” said Naqi.

Lucknow,The so-called distinct villain that we had in older days has disappeared from films: Gulshan Grover,"Gulshan Grover, being one of the most versatile actors in the Indian film fraternity, is also one of the first few actors to have successfully transitioned from Bollywood to Hollywood. Having worked in more than 400 films in India, the actor has earned a name in the industry (for his villainous roles) as the Bad Man of Bollywood. During his recent visit to Lucknow, Gulshan took a ride in the Lucknow Metro and spoke about it at length, ""Two of my friends, along with myself, travelled in the Lucknow Metro this time. It was very enjoyable. The stations looked spectacular with different themes. I just hope people maintain it properly and keep it clean. The metro is beautiful and it should definitely ease out the traffic on the roads."" Cinema has greatly evolved over the last couple of years with films like Padman, Badhaai Ho, Uri-The Surgical Strike, etc. doing so well at the Box office. Gulshan, who has witnessed this evolution upfront, said, ""Our cinema has emerged, I feel. Our scripts aren’t that long any more. Our fraternity is promoting better scripts, better storylines. There are newer kind of stories. There’s a cutting-edge cinema that deals with very hard subjects, then there’s smaller cinema dealing with short simple stories like Bareilly ki Barfi or Behen Hogi Teri... falana dhimkana. The content is so different with films like Shubh Mangal Saavdhan. Then there is a larger cinema and biopics which wasn’t there earlier. What’s interesting is that the different kinds of cinema are co-existing and doing so well, which was very difficult earlier. Bollywood has evolved in many ways for the better."" Gulshan Grover (BCCL)Gulshan Grover (BCCL) Speaking of how the image of villains has changed in the course of time, Grover who played villainous roles in films like Ram Lakhan, Sadak and Mohra, states, ""Writers and directors normally take inspiration from real life and translate it on reel. The so-called distinct villain that we had in older days has disappeared from society, the villain is now hidden. He might look like a nice person in the beginning and turn out to become a bad person or villain later or vice-versa. The writing and screen presence of the villain has gone through a lot of change. But the iconic villain is being missed, I can tell you that for sure. Ab Bollywood mein koi villain bacha hi kahan hai."" Having a lot of friends in the industry, Gulshan takes pride in having a special one in actor Shah Rukh Khan. The Behen Hogi Teri actor is extremely grateful to have him as a friend and gives much credit for his Hollywood career to the Badshaah. ""Shah Rukh Khan and I were working in director Aziz Mirza’s movie 'Yes Boss' (1997). That time, I had got selected for a Hollywood movie, 'The Second Jungle Book: Mowgli &amp; Baloo' (1997), to play the main antagonist. It was the final call for me to come to Hollywood and sign the film. I was in a big dilemma and Shah Rukh insisted I take the first flight to Hollywood. I remember clearly he said, ‘My friend go fly, make us proud’."" Shah Rukh committed to having Gulshan’s back and the actor successfully managed to sign the film. Since then there has been no turning back for the actor. Not just Bollywood or Hollywood, Gulshan goes on to list the different languages he has done films in including Polish, Iranian, Malay, French, Australian, German and Italian. Saying that it’s not so easy to be successful in Hollywood either, Gulshan opens about it, ""It is very difficult to get parts in Hollywood, considering they have notions like we tend to do loud acting, our stars break into a dance every five minutes, and other things like that. What they don’t understand is that it is eventually done for home consumption. That doesn’t mean we aren’t capable of international world-class acting. I’m glad that artists from our industry are getting roles there. It makes me so happy."" Gulshan further adds, ""We make multiple films, we do multitasking. We work in hard circumstances using obsolete types of equipment with no food in our stomach. We can do anything. In the West, their industry works in a very systematic way. The tasks allotted are very specific with specific information and enough resources, then you’re just expected to deliver it in a certain way."" Despite having made a mark for himself in Hollywood, Gulshan says it wasn’t without its insecurities and him being afraid of losing it all in Bollywood. ""The only time I was scared honestly was when I had 20 films waiting here, and there in Hollywood, I was struggling with photographs and I’d keep hearing ‘Who are you? We don’t know you. We haven’t seen any of your work.’ No one over there recognizes you or takes your autograph. Whereas as soon as you land in India, five producers will be standing there asking you to first read their scripts and then go home,"" he says, adding, ""That was honestly saddening and frightening when people ask who you are. You start to wonder why you’re doing what you’re doing. Why can’t you continue doing what the others are doing? The questions start to surround the mind. But then you hear a voice telling you that you have to do it, just as someone else does it too. This was the only sorrowful and confusing time, when I started to wonder why I’m trying to attempt something like this (venturing into Hollywood). But that fear was soon allayed and I managed some good projects there."" On the work front, Gulshan is happy to be playing the antagonist once again in blockbusters. ""Right now, I am working on three mega films. One of them is Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi. It is going to be a huge film. Rohit (Shetty) is one of the most wonderful directors I have worked within my career. Then there’s 'Sadak 2' with my favourite director Mahesh Bhatt saab. He is directing a film after so many years. I play the villain in that film as well. Lastly, there’s Mumbai Saga with the stylish director Sanjay Gupta who made Kaante and other wonderful films. Apart from me, the film also stars John Abraham, Emraan Hashmi and my dear friends Jackie Shroff and Suniel Shetty. It’s exciting to be a part of such big films,"" says Gulshan. — Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,"UP: Surprise checks find 10 DMs missing at ‘janta durbars’, govt mulls action","LUCKNOW: The government on Thursday launched a surveillance drive on top bureaucrats, who often skip the 9am ‘janta durbar’ and found 10 of the 75 district magistrates missing on Thursday. Showcause notices will be slapped on these DMs as well as six SSPs and SPs, who too were found absent when random calls were made to check attendance. The surprise check followed two notices issued by the chief minister to DMs, SSPs and SPs in June, directing them to be in office by 9am every day and attend to people’s grievances. Those guilty of violating the order would face strict action, including a pay cut, government sources told TOI. Late Wednesday, the chief minister asked the home department to carry out a surprise check on officers. On Thursday morning, nine officers were assigned to make calls on landlines of all the 75 DMs, SSPs and SPs. A senior official said the calls were made between 9.30 am and 10 am. Ten DMs and six SSPs and SPs were not present for the janta durbar, said a top government official. Talking to TOI, he said, “the CM had made it clear that he would not brook indiscipline, but he kept receiving complaints about officers missing at janta darbar,” said a senior official. While the absentee list of SSPs and SPs has been sent to the director general of police, action against 10 DMs is on the anvil. A senior officer said perpetual offenders were likely to face very strict action. “This was also not a one-off inspection. To ensure discipline in the bureaucracy, more surprise checks will be carried out,” said the officer. "
Lucknow,"Independence Day: UP govt tells madrassas to ensure national anthem singing, flag hoisting","LUCKNOW: The state government has asked all madrassas to hoist the national flag and sing the national anthem when they celebrate Independence Day on Thursday. The advisory, which was also sent out in 2017 and 2018, has been issued to all 19,125 registered madrassas in the state. Of these, 13,336 madrassas are currently operational. The advisory states that the madrassas have to submit a compliance report of the event within a week’s time. The circular has been issued by the registrar of UP Board of Madrassa Education (UPBME). It states that on August 15, madrassas must ensure that the national anthem is sung, the tricolour is hoisted, tribute are paid to freedom fighters and information on and importance of freedom fighters and Independence Day is told to madrassa students. It also calls for tree plantation and cultural performance on the premises on the day. The aim, said board registrar Shesh Nath Pandey, is to inculcate a feeling of national integration among madrassa students. “With this, we want madrassa students to participate in such celebrations which bring about a sentiment of national integration. Earlier, only a few madrassas would do this on their own,” Pandey said. The Islamic Madrassa Modernization Teacher’s Association of India, however, refuted the board’s claim. “Since the inception of most madrassas, national events like Republic Day and Independence Day were celebrated with great fervour. The government has started sending out an advisory so that it is perceived that Muslims did not celebrate national holidays, which is completely false,” said national president of the association Ajaz Ahamd. The advisory, when first sent out in 2017, had raked up a controversy as it was claimed that the UP government was forcing the singing of the national anthem and flag hoisting in madrassas. That year, madrassas were asked to submit video footage of compliance that further aggravated the issue. The next year, the video footage clause was removed. "
Lucknow,UP: Ex-DGP booked on complaint of former minister’s son,"LUCKNOW: Former Union minister Balram Singh Yadav’s son Vijay Yadav filed a complaint against former UP director general of police Jagmohan Yadav and his 65 aides at Gosainganj police station on Thursday. They were booked for criminal trespassing of land, rioting, armed with deadly weapons, provoking breach of peace, cheating by impersonation, cheating and dishonesty. The former DGP, however, denied the charges. Police lodged an FIR on the complaint of Vijay Yadav in a case of land dispute. He alleged in complaint that former DGP and his 65 aides started construction on his land on Tuesday and issued death threats to him. Yadav said that he had purchased 2 acre land in Haripur village of Bijnore pargana in Sarojininagar tehshil from one Gudda in 2010 for Rs 1.20 crore, but his land is now being encroached by Binni Infratech. “Director of Binni Infratech, Bacchu Kapoor, has prepared forged documents and is now staking claim on the western part of my land. Kapoor bought land in Muzaffarpur Ghuswal village opposite to my property from Aravali Builders in 2012 and got it registered,” said Yadav. They fudged documents and are now laying claim on my land, he added. He further alleged that the fraud was done with consent of the former DGP. Speaking to TOI, Vijay said, “The fraud can be gauged from the fact that the land was shown sold for Rs 60 lakh in 2012 in records though its registry value was Rs 90 lakh.” The ex-DGP denied all the charges and told TOI, “The FIR is baseless.” Refuting all charges in the complaint, he stated that he was following the order of SDM court.

Lucknow,UPPCL curtails power supply to tube wells by 8 hours,"LUCKNOW: The UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has decided to reduce power supply to tube wells from 18 hours to 10 hours, drawing ire of the consumers’ body. The development in the midst of kharif crop season follows separation of tube well feeders from the ones providing electricity to rural habitations where the state government promised at least 18 hours of supply. UPPCL has issued an order to all control rooms directing restriction of power supply to tube wells from 7am to 5pm. “After 5pm, the power supply to tube wells will get automatically snapped,” it says. When contacted, principal secretary (energy) Alok Kumar said that the 10-hour power supply to tube wells was good enough. “Separation of tube well feeders from rural ones will reduce the load and help in uninterrupted power supply to both tube wells as well as rural households,” he told TOI. Significantly, the development comes close on the heels of the government proposing a hike in power tariff for tube wells from Rs 150/horse power to Rs 170 per horse power. Earlier, when there was no feeder separation, there was 18 hours of power supply to tube wells. President of UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhogta Parishad said, “Reducing supply hours to tube wells must be accompanied by tariff reduction, else it would be an anti-farmers stance on the part of government.” The issue will now be taken up by UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC), which is taking petitions and holding public hearings in the state before announcing a fresh power tariff order, probably by the first week of September.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad gets land for waste plant, finally","GHAZIABAD: Efforts to build a waste-to-energy plant at Galand have received a major boost as the Ghaziabad Development Authority finally has the 14 acres of land it needed. Twelve farmers have agreed to part with their land at a mutually agreed upon rate, officials said. Last year, an NGT committee on solid waste management had barred the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation from dumping waste at Pratap Vihar. Now, with the GDA having got the land, work on the plant is likely to start soon, officials said.  “After a long hunt, we have managed to find the rest of the land that is required for setting up the waste to energy plant in Galand,” said Kanchan Verma, the GDA vice-chairperson. “Of the 35 acres required, we were already in possession of 18 acres and now, we have managed to convince 12 farmers to part with 14 acres. The remaining three acres will be provided by builders from integrated townships,” Verma added. Earlier, a rate committee had been set up to decide on the price at which the 14 acres would be acquired from farmers. “The panel had fixed a rate of Rs 2,550/sqm and the price had been agreed upon by the farmers. I have given administrative and financial clearance for it,” said Verma. Now, GDA will have to shell out close to Rs 16.5 crore for acquiring the land. Officials said they were hopeful that the registry of the land in the name of GMC would be done within a week. The state government had earlier selected a Netherland-based company, GC International, for developing the Galand waste to energy plant. Once the 35 acres is handed over to the company, it will go about making a DPR and it will take around two years to develop the plant, officials said. The civic body has been struggling to dispose about 1,000 metric tonnes of waste that the city generates daily. Currently, the GMC is dumping waste in Philikhwa and at a defunct brick kiln land taken on lease. Officials are hopeful that once the plant becomes operational, waste management would become easier.

Ghaziabad,Cash-strapped GDA hopes to raise Rs 300 crore by selling land for RRTS station,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) plans to sell 24,017 sqm, or nearly 6 acres, of land for Rs 328 crore near New Bus Stand to the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for construction of a station under the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project. The move is expected to give a big boost to GDA, which is facing a financial crunch and hasn’t been able to pay the salaries of the previous month till now to nearly 900 employees. Officials said the state government has given the go-ahead to GDA for the plan and a proposal in this regard will be sent to NCRTC for consideration. Along with the station, the space will also be used for commercial development. The rate has been fixed at Rs 1.10 lakh per sqm in accordance with the district administration’s circle rate. Besides that, an additional charge at the rate of 22% under the head of corner charge, lease rent and freehold will be imposed. At present, a tourism department-run Hindon Motel is present at the site. GDA chief engineer VN Singh said altogether 31,000 sqm of land was given to the tourism department on lease for 30 years in 1981, but the contract lapsed in 2011 and was not renewed. Of 31,000 sqm, 7,000 sqm was earlier used for the construction of a road and a roundabout. Apart from the land where Hindon Motel exists, a request for 8.5 acres near the elevated road at Vasundhara has also been made by NCRTC. A segment of the RRTS corridor, from Sahibabad to Duhai, is set to become operational by March 2023. The deadline for the entire corridor — Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Modipuram in Meerut — is March 2024. "

District administration officials had found maintenance of the elevated road unsatisfactory during chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s visit on Wednesday. The officials who have been given notices are executive engineer RP Singh, junior engineers Manoj Kumar Garg and Jagmohan Deori and assistant engineer RK Singh. “Officials have been asked to submit their replies within three days, explaining the reasons as to why action should not be taken against them. The private firm has also been directed to carry out frequent inspections on the stretch,” said the GDA secretary. According to sources, Rs 8 lakh is paid to the private firm every month for the cleaning and upkeep of the elevated road, and it takes just 10 minutes to the cover the entire stretch on one side. They said that filth had accumulated at the UP Gate side and the district administrative officials had a hard time dealing with the situation. They subsequently informed the GDA about it and sought immediate action against the erring officials. Ever since the opening of the elevated road in March last year, it is used by VVIPs and dignitaries to reach Delhi after touching down at Hindon air base. The GDA also plans to write to Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation, National Highways Authority of India, Noida Authority as well as Municipal Corporation of Delhi to ensure cleanliness on the stretch falling under their jurisdiction. On Thursday, a cleanliness drive was taken by the firm under the GDA officials’ watch. After the Lok Sabha polls, Adityanath had written to every district to ensure proper cleanliness on roads, besides proper implementation of plastic ban. "

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Road squatters to be removed from Raj Nagar Extension,"GHAZIABAD: Officials of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) have been pulled up its vice-chairman over rampant encroachments on both sides of Meerut bypass in Raj Nagar Extension. Junior engineers have been directed to take immediate action and also ensure that the encroachers, especially food and vegetable vendors, do not return, sources said. “During a plantation drive in Raj Nagar Extension area on August 3, GDA VC Kanchan Verma expressed her displeasure over the encroachments and directed officials concerned to initiate action against the squatters. This is because roads in Raj Nagar Extension will be developed as ‘model roads’ and the squatters are responsible for traffic jams in the area,” a source said. Officials have been directed to make public announcements asking violators to remove encroachments on their own. Moreover, they are required to prepare a list of people who have made permanent encroachments and initiate legal action against them under the provisions of the Urban Planning and Development Act. “GDA officials have also been directed to coordinate with the traffic police and ensure their presence between 3 pm and 6 pm on the road every day. Two cranes have been given at their disposal to tow away vehicles parked illegally on roadsides,” sources said. Residents said in absence of proper monitoring, encroachers do not pay much heed and start setting up shops on roadsides within a few days of their removal. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation has issued notices to recover parking charges from 14 establishments, mainly automobile showrooms, furniture showrooms, and a cinema hall in Sahibabad Site 4 and Link Road. Recently, GMC commissioner Dinesh Chandra had got a survey done in the area. Chief taxation officer Sanjeev Kumar Sinha said the penalty will be recovered from the shop owners on the basis of the space and number of vehicles parked in front of their establishments. The penalty is in the range of Rs 80,000 to Rs 6 lakh. "

Ghaziabad,CBI court issues warrant against sacked tax officer,"NEW DELHI: A CBI court in Ghaziabad has issued a production warrant against former revenue service officer Sanjay Kumar Srivastava, who was compulsorily retired recently, for failing to appear before it. Srivastava, who had filed multiple cases, was accused of deciding on 13 cases as commissioner for income tax appeals, which were outside his jurisdiction. While deciding 104 appeals, he uploaded some orders in June 2019 and allegedly backdated them to December 2018. In the dispatch records, he is accused of manipulating the orders to show that they were dispatched on June 7, 2019 when they were actually dispatched on 14 June, 2019, four days after his dismissal order.

In its chargesheet before compulsory retirement, the tax department had accused Srivastava of making “scandalous” allegations against colleagues apart from “an abuse of the process of” the court and intended to embarrass them. The government relied on seven charges dealing with court displeasure regarding ca-ses filed by him. In one case, the Delhi High Court had ordered 15 day imprisonment for violating court orders. "

Sharpshooter Shiv Prakash Tiwari, alias Dhoni, a native of Basti and wanted in at least six murders across the state, was carrying a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head. His accomplices, Manish Kesarwani and Anjani Singh of Allahabad, are named in two murders and several dacoities. According to SSP (STF) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj, they received a tip-off that Dhoni and his men were on their way to Chandauli district to kill MLA Singh at the behest of Bihar gangster Amarnath Chaubey. It is not immediately clear why Chaubey wanted the MLA dead. “A team of six chased the three, who were on two bikes, for 2km before intercepting them near Taktakpur gas agency under Cantonment police station area of the city (Varanasi),” SSP (STF) Pankaj said. Three countrymade pistols and nearly a dozen live cartridges were found on the trio. STF officers said Dhoni was named in six murders, including that of VHP state organiser BD Ojha in 2011 and two inmates in Basti jail in 2012. The shooter is also an accused in several cases of attempted murder, loot and dacoity. Manish and Anjani, accused in two murders, were champion bike racers, the officers said. “Dhoni came to know gangster Chaubey through Bihar cop-turned-criminal Abhishek, alias Bunty. After the murder of a lawyer in Allahabad in December 2018 and killing the latter’s brother in February this year, Dhoni and Manish had fled to gangster Chaubey’s safehouse in Siwan, Bihar,” SSP Pankaj said. The Bihar don hired the sharpshooter for Rs 12 lakh to eliminate a rival in Siwan in March. But, the target survived. Nevertheless, Chaubey took a fancy for Dhoni and the latter became his right-hand man. STF officers said they were grilling Dhoni and the others to know why the Bihar don wanted the BJP MLA from Chandauli dead. "
Lucknow,Health ATMs to buffer doctor crisis in UP’s remote areas,"LUCKNOW: To overcome the shortage of doctors in the rural hinterland, the state government has decided to introduce automated medicine dispensing machines on the lines of ATMs. Being started on a pilot basis, the authorities plan to install 500 such machines — nicknamed health ATMs — in remote areas where people have limited or no access to medical attention owing to distance from health centres. “These smart machines will be able to diagnose a medical condition in 16 minutes and dispense pills for free,” state health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said on Friday while addressing private players at a summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries here. No doctors in 22% PHCs in state, claims govt dataThe health ATMs are a part of the government’s ePHC (electronic primary health centre) project that integrates telemedicine with free drug distribution. Being rolled out by the National Health Mission, UP, with help from State Innovations in Family Planning Services Project Agency (SIFPSA), the project aims to address the issue of doctor crunch. According to government data, over 22% of PHCs in the state have no doctors. The project also aims to check pilferage of free drugs provided under various national programmes. “Most doctors do not want to serve in far-flung areas. But, they (people) cannot be left to fate. Technology will bridge this gap,” the minister said. Mission director, NHM, Pankaj Kumar said the project would be rolled out in 10 districts, including Varanasi and Gorakhpur, and eight aspirational districts listed by NITI Aayog. General manager (strategic consulting and expansions), DocOnline, Aritra Kundu said, “The medicine ATMs will have long-term implications on public health. The list of benefits includes saving people from quacks and saving the time lost in transportation.” Dr BK Jain of SIFPSA who is coordinating the project said many states had already successfully tested the ePHC and automatic medicine dispensing machines.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Teen afloat in Indira Canal, kin blame school principal","LUCKNOW: The body of an 18-year-old boy missing for two days was found in Indira Canal on Friday. The family of the boy, a class XI student, has filed a case of abetment to suicide against his school manager-cum-principal. Ashutosh Yadav, a resident of Chinhat, was missing since Wednesday. He had gone to school for registration in class XI but never returned home. On Thursday evening, his clothes were found near Indira Canal. Police roped in divers who located the decomposed body 1.5km away from the spot on Friday. In the FIR lodged at Chinhat police station, the boy's father Virendra Yadav (42), a farmer, has alleged that mental harassment caused by the school principal forced the boy to take the extreme step. He claimed that when the boy reached school on Wednesday morning, he was sent back by the principal with instructions to bring a photograph for filling the form for registration. ""Ashutosh came home, took the photograph and rushed back to school, but the principal told him that the registration time is over. This apparently led to depression that he would lose a year and forced my son to commit suicide,"" Virendra said in the FIR. He said that the boy was fine when he left home. Ashutosh had completed class X from another school and taken admission in the new school in the commerce stream about 15 days ago. While his mother was inconsolable, his elder brother Mohit told reporters that the school was responsible for Ashutosh's death. School manager Irshad Ahmad Siddiqui, who also serves as principal, said that the boy used to come late to school daily. ""While school starts at 8am, he used to come at 8.30am. On Wednesday, he came after 9am. We asked him to go back and come the next day on time because the school cannot relax rules for a student,"" he said, rubbishing allegations of mental torture. He also said that the registration process for class XI was ongoing and the question of the school denying it to an admitted student does not arise. "
Lucknow,"UP: Corruption buzz in stamps department, Yogi Adityanath nixes 300 transfers","LUCKNOW: Following allegations of irregularities in more than 300 transfers in the stamps and registration department, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has cancelled all the transfers. The move came after a delegation of employees met the CM and raised concerns about the large-scale transfers which have taken place in the department since June 1 this year. This is not the first instance when the CM has intervened in a department which is not directly under him, leading to disgruntled murmurs in the party and among bureaucrats. The minister for the stamps and registration department is Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’. However, sources say that the CM was “forced” to intervene because the minister was not taking appropriate action. Similar action was taken by him in the health department some weeks earlier, which is under Sidharth Nath Singh and the education department headed by Anupama Jaiswal. The CM has also ordered an inquiry into tenders issued by the PWD headed by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya. “When employees are directly meeting the CM, he will have to take action,” said an official in CM’s office about the latest move. For the other examples, he added, “If a particular minister is not working properly, the CM will have to intervene as he is concerned with all matters.” Earlier this week, Yogi had ordered an inquiry into e-tenders for projects worth Rs 6,000 crore issued by PWD over the past two years after receiving complaints that cartels had been formed to seize most of the projects. PWD officials refused to respond to questions about the inquiry, saying they should be directed to CM’s office. In the basic education department, sources said, an example of how the minister in-charge was being bypassed was the recent suspension of a basic shiksha adhikari from Unnao. “The order came directly from the CM’s office,” said a senior official.

Lucknow,This Lilliput ‘Mullaji’ from Kashmir grabbing eyeballs,"LUCKNOW: He may be barely a feet tall, but ‘Mullaji’ is nevertheless the talking point in Old City in the run-up to Bakrid Monday. The goat of a rare Kashmiri breed called Lilliput is the star attraction in the narrow lanes of Chaupatiyan evidently for its petite frame. Stunted limbs and a stubby body make even an adult Lilliput look as adorable as a baby goat. ‘Mullaji’s’ master Mohammed Taha, a graduation student, bought him from Kashmir through a vendor in Mumbai a year and a half ago. “I bought him for Rs 40,000. He was then only nine months old. Even as he grew older, he didn’t grow in size. His long goatee earned him the name ‘Mullaji’,” Taha said, adding, “He is currently 25cm tall and measures 45cm from head to tail.” Ever since Mullaji, the Lilliput goat, made Lucknow his home, he has grabbed eyeballs. “People stop and stare at him. He is rarely ever tied and follows orders like a dog. He is fond of biscuits, gram, spinach and radish leaves,” Taha said. At the goat market at Mehdi Ghat, Taha was offered Rs 50,000 for Mullaji. However, the student sold him to a Mumbai-based maternal uncle who paid Rs 75,000. “I now want to buy a female of the Lilliput breed,” Taha added. "
Lucknow,Ownership documents lost in ’82 dacoity: Akhara,"LUCKNOW: When Nirmohi Akhara staked ownership to the entire 2.77 acre disputed land in Ayodhya during day-to-day hearings in Supreme Court, it based its claims on a bundle of documents dating back to 1940, which the Akhara claimed to have lost in a dacoity in February 1982. When the counsel for Nirmohi Akhara placed its claim before the apex court on Wednesday, he said original documents on possession of disputed land were lost in a dacoity by at least 30 men at Ram Chabootra.

They tossed some documents into the well and torched remaining papers. When retrieved, the smudged, washed-out documents were rendered useless and later destroyed as trash,” Verma said. He claimed documents referred to the appointment of Mahant Raghunath Das as head of Nirmohi Akhara and attachment of the Babri mosque to the akhara. They also failed to furnish revenue records or any other proof of ownership in the apex court. “For 36 hours, dacoits ran amok on Ram Chabootra, but nobody dared to intervene because of their muscle power. An FIR named three people, Ram Balak, Ram Lakhan and Dharam Das and 30 unidentified persons under Section 395 of IPC for dacoity. Mahant Dharam Das also spent two months in jail,” said Verma's son, Tarun Jeet, who is assisting his father in the title suit. “The dacoity case was quashed by court as the sole eyewitness, a shopkeeper, at the Ram Chabootra gate, and the petitioner were intimidated by the accused. During an identification parade, Mahant Dharam Das assaulted Siya Ragho Saran before the police. And later, a compromise was hammered out,” said Verma. "

Ghaziabad,GDA withholds pay of 17 for failing to recover dues,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has withheld two months’ salary of 17 officials for failing to recover dues under different heads. The move comes at a time coffers of the development agency are drying up and it is facing difficulty in funding projects. GDA vice-chairperson Kanchan Verma said she had also fixed a monthly target for officials of the enforcement wing. If they fail to recover the amount specified by the VC, their salaries, too, will be held back. The development agency had been faced with dues amounting to Rs 720 crore under heads like development, compounding and property charges. “In the current financial year, we managed to recover a little over Rs 200 crore. But this is way short of the total pending dues,” said Verma. “Our enforcement wing is clearly not doing enough to recover the dues. So, I have withheld two months’ salary of 17 officials. This is affecting the funding of projects,” she added. There are three builders who owe the GDA Rs 250 crore in total. “These builders have filed cases in courts as they feel we have not calculated their dues properly. Until the court decides on the matter, we can’t do anything about it. This has worsened our financial woes,” Verma said. The VC has asked enforcement officials to recover Rs 60 crore a month in dues. “If they fail to meet the target, their salaries will be withheld,” she said.GDA’s financial woes have been compounded by the fact that it is facing difficulty in finding takers for its housing projects, which have been built at a cost of Rs 1,600 crore. The agency also has to pay installments for a loan taken for the Hindon elevated road and to farmers whose land it has acquired for the Madhuban-Bapudham housing scheme. Earlier too, the GDA VC had held back the salary of 17 junior engineers for failing to address complaints on the agency’s portal. Verma had herself held back her salary of 10 days as work piled up. The GDA has recently introduced a single window system in its attempt to bring transparency and accountability. The single window system was created to attend to public queries and complaints and keep track on the progress of work of different departments. "

Lucknow,"17 Lucknow cops went rogue in a year, got the boot","LUCKNOW: Suspended police constable Alok Singh has been named in the FIR lodged for the murderous July 30 attack on realtor brothers Shahid and Namvar Jafri in Hazratganj. Benched since 2006 when his name figured in a loot case, Singh is not the only policeman who has left the force red in the face. From August last year till now, 17 city cops have been either arrested or booked for their alleged role in various criminal activities, ranging from extortion and nexus with dons to dacoity and loot. A trader had accused Singh of looting gold worth Rs 5 lakh in Naka in 2006. Based on the FIR, the constable was booked, but charges against him could not be proved and he was sent back to the lines. Singh’s name figured once more in a loot near Jail Road in 2008 and departmental action was ordered. He was later transferred to Unnao district. Local intelligence report suggest he has links with a don in Jaunpur. The matter is under investigation. In 2017, sub-inspector Dhirendra Shukla and two constables had arrested four youths and booked them for hatching a conspiracy to kill gangster Aquil Ansari allegedly at the behest of trader Srawan Sahu. The case was transferred to a special unit when parents of the youths met the SSP and accused the sub-inspector of framing their children. Investigations later revealed that Shukla was in touch with Ansari and had indeed framed the four to implicate Sahu. Don Ansari was in jail for the murder of trader Sahu’s son, Ayush, and wanted to prevent the father from deposing before court. Sub-inspector Shukla, caught aiding the don, was on the run since. He was arrested four months ago. In yet another case of lawkeepers gone rogue, an officer of DSP-rank posted in the Special Task Force (STF) was booked in April this year, along with an inspector, for robbing a Delhi-based businessman. The cops had slapped false charges on the businessman, accusing him of running a hawala racket. In March this year, sub-inspectors Pawan Mishra and Ashish Tiwari in uniform and constables Pradeep Bhadauria and Anand Yadav in plain clothes raided the flat of a businessman in Gosainganj and looted Rs 1.86 crore. They were arrested based on CCTV camera footage. 10 cops booked for robbing Agra-based jeweller in DecemberAs many as 10 policemen were booked in December 2018 for robbing an Agra-based jeweller in Madiaon on the pretext of routine checking. In his complaint to the SSP, the victim said the cops took away jewellery worth Rs 15 lakh from him. They were suspended and the matter is being probed by the Crime Branch. Former state police chief Sulkhan Singh told TOI that supervisory officers must be held responsible for such incidents. “It is the job of the supervisory officers to see that inspectors, sub-inspectors and constables have rotational duty,” the former DGP said. Retired DIG Rajesh Rathore conceded dearth of self-control and discipline among men in uniform. “There should be a mechanism to keep routine vigil on cops too like it happens in developed countries,” he suggested.

Lucknow,"Come November, Wi-Fi campus for LU students","LUCKNOW: Students of Lucknow University can look forward to a Wi-Fi campus before their alma mater turns 100 in three months from now. More than 80% of the wireless fidelity project, pending for five years, has been completed and the university is aiming to join a growing league of tech-savvy campuses before it hits a century on November 25. While the main project has been undertaken by the Lucknow University Data Resource Centre, a separate Wi-Fi network is also being made available by an industry giant under its corporate social responsibility. “The technical team has connected almost all the departments and the Tagore Library. The university hopes to become a Wi-Fi campus before completion of its 100 years on November 25,” said vice-chancellor SP Singh. Director of the data resource centre professor Anil Mishra said in the first phase of the project, they would provide free Wi-Fi access only on the academic campus and later extend the same to hostels. “Only LU students and faculty members will be given user names and passwords for access. The usage will be unlimited at a speed of 10 Gbps,” he added. Mishra said the biggest advantage of the university making Wi-Fi available on its own and not through a third party vendor was that students could easily access the Information and Library Network (INFLIBNET) using the facility. INFLIBNET is an autonomous Inter-University Centre (IUC) of the University Grants Commission (UGC) that allows sharing of library and information resources and services among academic and research institutions. The separate Wi-Fi service being provided by the corporate giant will have as many as 186 access points, covering the LU campus and boys’ and girls’ hostels. "

As a result, Ganga water supply will be affected in Indirapuram and at other paces till August 15. “On both sides of the highway, two 12.5km water pipelines run from Masuri to Vijay Nagar. We are in the process of shifting the pipes,” said Singh. A GDA official said Indirapuram residents will receive water only once in the day. "

The newborn girl, who was found abandoned along a road in Mohanlalganj in early July with maggots crawling all over her body, was discharged on Saturday night from the private hospital she was being treated here in the city. Childline has sent the infant to a shelter on Prag Narain Road. A month hence, she will be put under Central Adoption Resource Authority so that she finds her forever home, said child welfare committee member Sangeeta Sharma. While the baby girl is off medication and is said to be responding well to oral feeding, her treating doctor said a CT scan of her head showed signs of ""certain irregularities"", which can be diagnosed better only after she grows up a bit. ""We found her reflexes to be a little slow. Hence, the CT scan was done. We did notice some changes in her brain, which could be a result of the limited oxygen that reached it during the initial 24-48 hours of birth, since she was dumped in a bush,"" said Dr Waqar Beg. In strict medical parlance, her condition may be called hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or HIE. ""Fortunately, as of now, there are no manifestations of it in her development. However, she will need proper care and support. Check-up will be necessary once she is three months old and again, at six months,"" the doctor added. The baby was found in a thicket in neighbouring Mohanlalganj on July 13. Doctors, who found at least 35 maggots in her private parts, insect bites on her face and limbs and treated her for blood infection, anaemia and jaundice, today deservedly call her god's miracle. "
Lucknow,Will Lucknow civic body stop the rot and bring cheer this Bakrid?,"LUCKNOW: Unattended garbage and carcass remains may get your goat next week, as 1,000-odd sanitation workers of Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) are expected to be on leave on Monday for Bakrid celebrations. The city has an army of 10,000 sanitation workers. Of the 9,000 who will hopefully be on duty, around 6,000 are permanent employees and the rest are contractual workers. While the LMC claims it has made adequate arrangements to buffer the worker crunch, residents remain sceptical. Times ViewGarbage piles are a common sight after festivals and every time LMC cites absence of sanitary workers due to holiday as an excuse, but this year the Municipal Commissioner has assured better services by deploying adequate hands for door-to-door garbage collection and placing extra bins in congested localities. However, what the commissioner will have to keep in mind is that more waste is generated in festivals, compared to normal days, hence senior officers will have to keep strict vigil so that the efforts made by the corporation are visible on the ground.Last year, around 700 metric tonne of waste was generated on Bakrid. This year, the LMC expects around 900 metric tonne. So, it has increased the number of vats from 32 to 50 across the city. Also, the number of trucks for door-to-door collection has been increased from 25 to 35. But, how it will manage solid waste in the absence of 1,000 employees remains the question. The challenge is likely to be more for residents in the Old City, which is congested and arguably more neglected. Residents said the LMC had promised arrangements during Bakrid in the past too, but no one came to collect trash from their homes while garbage vats were few and far between. ""Last year, we kept waiting for the LMC vehicle to come and collect the animal remains. It didn't. We dumped the carcass near our house. Even two days later, it was lying there and rotting, as LMC workers didn't come,"" said Anab Rizvi, a resident of Maulviganj. Nadeem Siddique of Nakkhas dubbed LMC promises hollow. ""Most people in my area were forced to dumped animal remains on a vacant plot and stray dogs made a mess of the place,"" he said. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said they had taken lessons from the past and made ""foolproof arrangements"" this year. Around 50 vats are being installed in prominent areas like Maulviganj, Nakkhas, Aminabad, Raqabganj, Yahiyaganj, Chowk and Thakurganj while a fleet of 35 trucks will ensure door-to-door carcass collection. ""We will float a helpline number where residents can lodge their complaints if waste is not collected. We have made around 17 big pits on the outskirts of the city where animal remains collected from households will be buried,"" Tripathi added. "

Lucknow,"Border tensions soar, but Indo-Pak peace legacy continues in Barabanki","LUCKNOW: At a time when India and Pakistan are again locked in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation over Kashmir after the scrapping of Article 370, the legacy of peace that began 55 years ago at Barabanki, 1,500km from ground zero, will continue on Tuesday with the hosting of the 55th conference of India-Pak-Bangla Federation. And veteran socialist Rajnath Sharma has invited freedom fighters, Left leaders and advocates of the federation from across the borders to join the peace initiative. The Indo-Pakistan federation was the brainchild of socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia and Jan Sangh ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay in 1964, when the two countries were on the verge of war. And the first conference was held that year in Barabanki. The agenda was clear - Since both India and Pakistan were battling poverty and illiteracy, there was no point in waging war, instead a mechanism should be in place to maintain peace. Rajnath Sharma, a follower of Lohia, lit the spark for peace and since then the conference has been regularly organised and attended by prominent personalities from India and Pakistan. Sharma has been writing to different embassies to mobilise support for his campaign. After Bangladesh was created, the federation invited the new neighbour and renamed the forum as Indo-Pakistan-Bangladesh Federation. Talking to TOI, Sharma recalled during Emergency when he was in Naini prison with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, even the BJP patriarch favoured setting up the federation. Sharma said since the three countries had similar socio-economic conditions and faced discrimination from West, they should come under one umbrella and march together for peace and prosperity. ""If East and West Germany can demolish the Berlin Wall and turn into one country, why can't the beginning be made with this federation,"" said Rajnath Sharma, 75, who was supported in his mission by Ram Manohar Lohia, Captain Abbas Ali, MA Halim, Raghu Thakur, Sagir Ahmed and veteran journalists, Ram Bahadur Rai, Hemant Sharma and later by former PM Chandra Shekhar, former Union minister George Fernandes. Former prime minister Nawaj Sharif had also written to Rajnath Sharma and acknowledged his efforts. "

Lucknow,"Not rescued after accident, delivery man dies in drain","LUCKNOW: A food delivery executive who met with a road accident in Vibhuti Khand on Monday succumbed to his injuries allegedly because of tardy police response which, in turn, delayed medical attention. The body of Alok Kumar Dubey (26) was retrieved from a nullah four hours after his bike plunged into the drain following a collision with an SUV. Oddly, the driver and four passengers of the SUV, which had fallen into the same nullah, were rescued within 10 minutes and sent to hospital. Alok Kumar Dubey (deceased)An autopsy has revealed that Alok died of ante-mortem injuries, suffered in the accident, and not drowning. Police, in their defence, have said neither the other injured nor eyewitnesses had mentioned anything about a bike being involved in the accident. According to the FIR lodged by father Devendra Kumar Dubey, Alok was returning after a delivery when the speeding SUV — ferrying passengers from Bahraich — hit his bike from behind near Kathauta Crossing around 1.20am. Alok lost control and fell into the nullah. The SUV followed. Local residents informed police. The SUV driver and passengers were rescued and taken to RML Hospital from where they were discharged after first aid. The young food delivery guy, buried under his bike, missed everyone’s attention until a crane pulled out the SUV. “Around 5am, we were informed about a body in the nullah where the accident had taken place a few hours ago. We rushed to the spot and removed the SUV with a crane. The body was found under the bike. That is when we figured out that the accident involved two vehicles. The SUV occupants had not said anything about a biker,” said Vibhuti Khand SHO Rajiv Dwivedi. Police have registered a case of rash driving and causing death by negligence against unidentified persons. Asked why the SUV driver had not been named in the case, Dwivedi said the matter was under investigation. “Name/s will be added as and when things become clearer,” he added.

Ghaziabad,"Two flyovers, an underpass to ease traffic from northeast Delhi to Ghaziabad","NEW DELHI: Lakhs of commuters can look forward to an easier ride to the east of the city with the Public Works Department planning two flyovers and an underpass in northeast Delhi en route to Ghaziabad. The facilities should be ready in two years’ time, officials said on Tuesday. This project, estimated to cost Rs 800 crore, is meant to ease traffic movement at three major intersections. While it has been passed by Delhi’s transport infrastructure overseer Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre, or UTTIPEC, it is yet to be approved by Delhi government. The construction phase will begin as soon as that clearance is acquired. The two flyovers will be the first of their kind, being double-deck structure, with the first level to be used by cars and the second for the Delhi Metro Phase IV corridor. “There needs to be some gap obviously between the two surfaces, so the vehicular level will be constructed 5.5 metres above the ground and the metro line will be made a further 5.5 metres above that,” disclosed a PWD official. The first flyover, 1.5-km long, will be erected a hundred metres ahead of the existing flyover at Khajuri Khas. This will ease the way for commuters who regularly get stuck at the Khajuri Khas intersection. An underpass will be constructed at the Loni intersection and this will be followed by the second 1.5-km-long flyover starting at Gagan Cinema in Nand Nagri area. Officials said the two flyovers will have six lanes each, while the underpass will have four lanes. The construction of these flyovers and underpass will unravel the traffic knots at the Bhajanpura and Ghonda junctions. The construction activity is not expected to affect the existing vehicular movement. “When the construction work begins, half of the road on either side will be occupied by rubble. To ensure traffic does not need to halt, the median between the main road and the service lane will be removed, giving us more space to use for traffic,” the official said. The official also disclosed that the original budget of Rs 350 crore for the first flyover and Rs 390 crore collectively for the underpass and the second flyover is likely to come down now that Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has decided to add a metro track on the second decks of the structures and so share some of the costs.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Kid brushes against car, man shoots at neighbour","LUCKNOW: A minor argument between neighbours took a nasty turn when one opened fire and injured a domestic help of the other late on Monday. The incident in Indiranagar took place in front of two policemen who had come to resolve the dispute. While the key accused is on the run, police have arrested his brother and accomplice for assault and attempt to murder. According to the FIR, an argument broke out between Sector 12 resident Abhishek Srivastava, an executive with a private firm, and his neighbour and businessman Atul Yadvendra after Abhishek’s six-year-old son enjoying a stroll with his parents unwittingly touched Atul’s car, setting off the alarm. The angry businessman, his brother Shekhar and three others allegedly hurled abuses at the couple. When Abhishek’s wife Deepika protested, Atul reportedly fired at her. Domestic help of the Srivastavas, Ajay Gupta, suffered a bullet wound trying to save her. “We first rushed Ajay to hospital and then lodged a complaint at Indiranagar police station,” Abhishek said, stressing that the group also assaulted his wife. The incident, according to Abhishek, took place around 11.30pm. “My son playfully touched the car, but our neighbour became abusive. He and his men used expletives and also assaulted my wife. Two cops who were on patrol stopped to see what happened. But before anyone realised what my neighbour was upto, he brought a gun and fired. Ajay came in the way and saved my wife,” the private firm executive said. Ghazipur circle officer said a police party searched the house of the accused on being informed by the patrol team and found two .32-bore bullets that are generally used in licensed firearms. “The accused (Atul) was not present and we were also not able to recover the gun. We have registered a case of assault and attempt to murder against him and his brother (Shekhar). The latter has been arrested,” the officer added. Atul’s family has, however, denied all allegations. His wife contended that they were on the terrace when they saw Ajay, the domestic help, trying to damage their car. “We shouted at him to stop, but Abhishek and Deepika came out in his support and started abusing us. We called the cops on Dial 100. Abhishek mobilised 10-15 people in the meantime and created ruckus in front of our house,” she said, but remained tight-lipped about the firing. "
Ghaziabad,56 dangerous spots in Loni waterbodies,"GHAZIABAD: The city has been a witness to a number of drowning death cases in the recent past. After several incidents of children downing in ponds and pits, the Ghaziabad administration had ordered police to carry out a survey of such dangerous spots in the Loni area. The cops, meanwhile, have identified 56 such places. The list includes dried up wells, canals, ponds and pits, mainly near defunct brick kiln spots, where drains for rainwater have filled up. The administration, meanwhile, has asked the revenue department to secure such dangerous water bodies by fencing them and putting up warning signs. “On June 28, three children had drowned in an illegal open pit in Loni’s Bharat City area following which, the administration had ordered police to conduct a survey,” said N K Jadon, SP (rural). “Under Loni border police station, there are 21 unsafe ponds/pits while under Loni police station, the count is 26.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Burglars party on booze before bagging Rs 23 lakh booty at dead army doctor’s home,"LUCKNOW: Burglars with perhaps a hedonistic bent of mind partied on expensive liquor and dry fruits before cleaning out cash and jewellery worth Rs 23 lakh from a house in Aashiana. The break-in came to light on August 8 when the owners returned after a two-week vacation. An FIR was lodged against an unspecified number of unidentified persons on August 9. Police are looking for clues in CCTV camera footage. The two-storey house belongs to colonel (retired) Pooran Chandra Sharma, a doctor in the Army Medical Corps who passed away on July 10. His wife Kamini Sharma (64) and daughters Meenakshi (34) and Nupur (30) were away visiting his son, Dr Mohit Sharma (40), in Gurugram. The women had left town on July 29 and returned last Thursday to find the lower half of the main door cut open. Inside, all the rooms — including the puja chamber — were ransacked and valuables missing. Dry fruits littered the floor while three empty bottles of expensive whiskey, brandy and gin stood on the table along with used glasses — all taken out from the mini-bar once maintained by the retired colonel. “The intruders had also taken out fruit juice and ice cubes from the fridge in our kitchen. It shows they were professionals who had done a recce and were aware of our absence,” Nupur said. The family said the burglars had taken away Rs 3 lakh in cash, besides jewellery, designer clothes and shoes worth Rs 20 lakh. “We found our car and scooter keys on the corridor of the house, which means they tried to take the vehicles away too, but perhaps dropped the idea when they failed to open the main gate,” Nupur said. The family has expressed disappointment with the pace of investigation. “Though we have given a list of suspects, no concrete action has been taken yet,” Nupur added. Aashiana SHO Vishwajeet Singh said they were scanning CCTV camera footage available for the period when family was out of station. “The burglary seems to have been carried out by 3-5 persons,” the officer said.

GDA vice-chairperson Kanchan Verma has sent a letter to the agencies asking them to depute officials to ensure cleanliness near the entrance. The two civic agencies have been asked to carry out a cleanliness drive. The VC said, apart from the general public, the road is also used by VVIPs. The letter stated that CM Yogi Adityanath, after getting down at Hindon airbase, takes this road to go to Delhi. It further stated that the NHAI has been carrying out road-widening work for many years near the entrance, because of which, sludge remains deposited on the down ramp. In monsoon, the situation worsens, the letter said. On Thursday, GDA secretary Santosh Kumar Rai had served a show-case notice to an executive engineer, two junior engineers, an assistant engineer as well as the private company, which has been given the contract to maintain Hindon elevated road, for the shoddy upkeep of the road. District administration officials had found maintenance of the elevated road unsatisfactory during the CM’s visit last Wednesday. Meanwhile, sources said GDA is yet to receive reply from the private firm, which is paid Rs 8 lakh per month for the upkeep of the elevated road. Sources also added that a letter was sent to the NHAI in the past to carry out their work while maintaining cleanliness near the road. "

Police are also probing the role of two contractual staffers of the department that issues arms licences in the district in the scam. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said the scam came to light after his office received applications requesting transfer of gun licences from Shahjahanpur to addresses in Ghaziabad. When the unique identification number (UIN) on one of the licences was found to be invalid, an investigation was launched.

Lucknow,Signalling change: Police to track every move of yours on Lucknow roads,"LUCKNOW: It would no longer be easy for commuters to hoodwink traffic cops if they flout the rules. Reason being the much-awaited Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS), which uses artificial intelligence to manage traffic, will be launched on August 15. The project was conceived under the Smart City plan for Lucknow. Initially, it will become functional in only four out of 105 crossings shortlisted for the project because 60% work of installing infrastructure for the system is not complete yet, despite the deadline extended twice this year. Moreover, the control room in the Smart City Command Centre, which will monitor all the crossings, will be fully ready only after three months. The command centre has been built in Lalbagh. While first floor has been dedicated for civic services, the second floor will have the set up for ITMS. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said though the project was announced in 2016, work began only in December 2018 because of the lengthy paperwork and tendering process. General manager, Smart City project Lucknow, Farid Zaidi said the entire ITMS will be completed by October 15 this year. ASP (traffic) Poornendu Singh claimed that ITMS will effect a major change in the city's traffic scenario. “It will not only end long traffic snarls but also make traffic more disciplined, and lead to better policing,” said Singh. Later, more features like parking sensors and location of hospitals and petrol pumps will be also displayed on crossings for the convenience of commuters, ASP added. "
Ghaziabad,Private agency to design two crossings in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: Under its new traffic mobility plan to decongest two crossings on Hapur road and GT Road, the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has decided to get the designs prepared by a private firm at a cost of Rs 2.75 lakh each. Officials said the Choudhary mor (junction) and a crossing near the District Collectorate have been chosen for the pilot project. The GDA had recently roped in Urban Mass Transit Company (UMTC), a transport consultance firm, to prepare the designs of crossings that fall on the 5-km Hapur road and 3-km GT road stretches. The corridors were suggested by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) as part of the traffic mobility. The Hapur road stretch will extend from the GDA office in Navyug Market to NDRF office, and the GT Road stretch from Thakurdwara to Opulent Mall through Choudhary Mor. The private firm will also coordinate with Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC), traffic police and Public Works Department (PWD) till the construction of roads are complete. The CRRI in its report had suggested changes on the five most congested corridors, and after an inspection, the GDA had chosen the two crossings to ease vehicular movement. "

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Three Bawaria gang members held for Tronica City murders,"GHAZIABAD: Police on Tuesday arrested three members of the notorious Bawaria gang for allegedly killing two persons during a robbery in Ghaziabad’s Tronica city last Monday. According to the cops, the accused have been identified as Jogender (46) and his son Bhupender (20), both from Masuri area of Ghaziabad, and Ankush (28) from Hapur. On August 5, two persons were killed while one received bullet injuries after being shot by a gang of robbers that had barged into a house in Tronica City. The 3am robbery took place in the single-storey house of Dharamveer, one of the deceased, in Pooja Colony. Dharamveer, who suffered three bullet injuries, had died on the spot. He had been sleeping outside his house ever since the shutter of his shop started malfunctioning a few days ago. He had turned the front portion of his house into a grocery store and it led to the rooms inside. Two neighbours of Dharamveer had come for help but they were also shot at by the accused, in which Babu was killed and his brother was injured. Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, SP (rural) told TOI that the accused didn't want to kill anybody during the robbery. “Dharamveer’s wife had managed to get out of the house and started shouting for help, after which they men tried to flee. The entry and exit points of the house were narrow, due to which one of them fell on the ground and Dharmaveer caught one of them. The other gang members entered the house again to free him when one of the accused shot at the shopkeeper,” he added. On July 31, the gang also robbed a house in Hapur. “There are 15 members in the gang. One of the members, used to check where the CCTV cameras are installed near the house. Police traced the face of him in a CCTV footage. The cops also identified nine members who were caught in the CCTV footage of nearby areas. During the investigation, it came to light that some of the accused also ran vegetable and fruit shops near the house, while others work as labours and in restaurants,” the SP said. “On August 7, one of the gang members – Pradeep – had surrendered in a theft case in Hapur. Police are trying to nab the other members,” Jadaun said. "
Ghaziabad,Builders protest GDA drive to seal projects,"GHAZIABAD: Small developers under the banner of Ghaziabad builders’ welfare association on Tuesday protested outside the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) office, alleging that the Authority is acting in an arbitrary manner when comes to sealing projects. The move came after the GDA’s recent crackdown on illegal constructions and lodging of FIRs against errant builders at Indirapuram township. “There are over 300 illegal colonies in the district as per GDA’s own admission. The authority has failed to act against those colonies while small developers are being singled out by the GDA,” said Rajiv Sharma, president of the association. “In the past fortnight or so, the GDA has sealed several single unit flats and lodged nine FIRs. Every now and then, we are being harassed by GDA officials on one pretext or the other. Some officials are also demanding bribe,” Sharma said. On Tuesday, the protesters submitted a memorandum to GDA officials and demanded a meeting with the vice-chairperson. “Barring few instances, the GDA has never acted against big builders although there are violations,” Sharma said. Santosh Rai, the secretary, GDA, said: “GDA is justified in taking action against any violation without making distinctions between big or small developers and that is exactly we are doing.” "
Ghaziabad,Booster on cards for Ghaziabad Ganga water lines,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) plans to spend over Rs 84 crore on re-laying of pipelines to supply Ganga water to the Indirapuram township. Officials said the project had been prepared keeping in mind the water requirement in Indirapuram for the next 30 years and would be executed in seven phases. And in the first phase, around 90km of pipeline will be laid in Indirapuram by 2022. The next six phases have been divided into five years each and work like installations of tubewells and pumping stations will be carried out in accordance with the increase in population, the officials said. “The Rs 84.07 crore project has been sent to the state government for its approval. The government has to decide if it wants to execute the scheme under the Union government’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. There is also a plan in place to handover the township to the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation,” VN Singh, GDA’s chief engineer, told TOI on Tuesday. Nearly 80% of water pipeline and 35% of sewage pipeline in Indirapuram need replacement due to population boom in the township, officials said. Spread in an area of 1,222 acres, the existing water, sewer and drainage network was laid in Indirapuram in 1990. The GDA had then planned the township to be a low-population density area, but over the years, it had increased the floor area ratio (FAR) amid a real estate boom as it became an ideal destination for those who came to NCR with jobs and affordable homes. Due to various other policies of the government, more and more societies began coming up in Indirapuram, leading to an increase in population but at the same time rendering the existing infrastructure redundant. Besides laying of the pipeline, provisions have also been made for installing tubewells and pumping stations. For installing tubewells, the authority will seek a no-objection certificate from the National Green Tribunal. “ While Rs 70.78 crore would be spent on re-laying of pipelines with bigger diameter to solve low-water pressure problem, the remaining money would be spent in the next 30 years,” another official said. At present, Ganga jal is supplied to the township by the irrigation department. After the monsoon, when the irrigation department carries out the de-siltation work, water is supplied through tubewells. Ganga water is channelled through a 185km upper Ganga canal from Haridwar to Dasna in Ghaziabad. From there, through a 19km pipeline, it is brought to Pratap Vihar Ganga jal treatment plant where it is processed and 360 MLD is supplied to parts of Ghaziabad and Noida. "
Lucknow,Lesson for UP: Punjab's battle against narcotics,"LUCKNOW: An effective crackdown on the narcotics menace in Punjab has triggered worries in Uttar Pradesh, with officials suspecting that most drug dealers have already crossed the border and are targeting colleges and hostels in western UP. To buffer an anticipated crisis, a team is being sent to Chandigarh on August 20 to study the enforcement mechanism in Punjab so that the same can be implemented in UP. ""The Centre held a meeting with state officials where it raised concerns about drugs becoming more easily available in western UP, especially in government and private colleges. We are formulating a policy to control the situation,"" said Manoj Singh, principal secretary, social welfare. Two officers from the prohibition department will visit Chandigarh, study the enforcement mechanism and submit a report to the social welfare department. Punjab was in the tight grip of a drug problem until recently. The state government took stringent measures like appointing an ADG exclusively for curbing drug use. As a result, much of the trade has moved into neighbouring states, say experts. Sources in the government said western UP had provided ""ideal conditions"" for the illegal trade and supply of drugs owing to its proximity to the national capital and Punjab. Cash transactions are also easier, as the region is industrially sound and agriculturally rich.  ""There has been a mushrooming of colleges in Noida and Greater Noida areas. Many of these, especially private colleges, have become preying ground. We do not have formal complaints yet, but there are several reports on how drug use has become rampant in the area, particularly in colleges,"" said a senior government official. The UP government is planning to work on two levels. First, an enforcement plan will be proposed to curb sale, distribution and use of drugs. This action will be supported by involvement of NGOs who will help identify problem pockets and offer counselling. "
Lucknow,"Conman dares victim: 'I commit online frauds, do whatever you can'","LUCKNOW: A 29-year-old merchant navy officer, who was recently swindled out of Rs 9,000 online, was stumped more by an open challenge issued to him than the con itself. “Main online fraudkarta hoon. Jo ban paaye kar lo (I commit online frauds. Do whatever you can),” the man on the phone had snapped at Gaurav Mishra when the latter had said he would lodge a police complaint. “I told him I would call the cops on him, but he was so brazen... He was not afraid of being caught and punished,” Mishra recalled as he lodged an FIR at Chinhat police station on Tuesday, detailing how the man posed as a buyer on a sale-and-purchase website and took him for a ride. A resident of Vigyan Khand in Gomtinagar, the merchant navy officer had posted an online ad to sell two beds. A caller offered to pay him Rs 9,000 in advance through an app. On his request, Mishra installed the app and linked it to his bank account. Next, the caller sent Mishra a link on WhatsApp and asked him to click on the same for money transfer. As soon as Mishra clicked on the link and entered the six digit PIN, Rs 9,000 was debited from his bank account. Most phone fraudsters still elusive, admit copsThe merchant navy officer called the purported buyer and asked him to return the money. The man sent two more links with the promise that clicking on them would transfer the money back. Mishrarefused to follow his instructions any further and threatened to go to police. “That is when the buyer showed his real self and challenged me to do whatever I could,” Mishra said. An advocate in Indiranagar has also been tricked in a similar fashion. Puneet Tripathi (27) wanted to sell a sofa online. A buyer offered him Rs 8,500 for it and said the payment would be made through an e-wallet. He sent a QR code (matrix or two-dimensional barcode) to Tripathi’s cellphone. The advocate scanned the code and followed the instructions. But, instead of receiving the payment, he lost Rs 70,000 in multiple transactions. While the police claim they are tracking the numbers from which the victims received calls, records show that most vishing (fraud though phone calls) cases in the city are still unresolved. Abhay Mishra, nodal officer of Lucknow police cyber cell, conceded that they had busted card cloning gangs, but phone fraudsters were elusive. “No arrest has been made in any vishing case because culprits tend to operate from other states and keep changing their locations,” he said. The officer, however, maintained that the money could be recovered by requesting banks to stop transactions, provided victims reported the matter within 24 hours. In 2018, out of 385 vishingincidents, money was recovered in 85% cases, he added. "

Lucknow,Rs 3.5 crore: What home owners did not pay LMC over four years,"LUCKNOW: After Gomtinagar and Gomtinagar Extension, hundreds of houses in localities like Indiranagar, Mahanagar and Vikasnagar in zone 7 of Lucknow Municipal Corporation have been found to be paying undervalued house tax for the past four years. This has resulted in a loss of Rs 3.5 crore to the civic body for the duration. There are a total of 35,000 houses in zone 7. The Geographic Information Service (GIS) survey conducted by a private agency covered 20,000 houses in the first phase. Of these, 1,000 houses were found to be paying house tax less than their floor area since 2014. The rest of the houses in the zone will be surveyed this month. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said, “House tax is based on self-assessment of floor area. The owners misinformed us about the actual floor area of the house, which automatically reduced the tax.” A similar survey in zone 4, which includes Gomtinagar and Gomtinagar Extension, had found that of a total 40,000 households, nearly 7,000 were paying less house tax, resulting in a loss of Rs 15 crore since 2014. TOI had reported this on August 1. LMC is conducting a GIS survey across all eight zones in the city to get an estimate of the number of households and property tax paid by them. “After finding a huge difference between the estimated amount and the actual house tax amount collected in zone 4, we decided to conduct a survey. After surveying just two zones, a lot of irregularities came to the fore. We will continue the survey in the remaining six zones as well,” Tripathi added. After covering the entire city, data base of all households will be maintained at the newly constructed Smart City Command Centre for assessment and tax collection in future. "

Ghaziabad,"CISF road submerges after rain, halts traffic","GHAZIABAD: The CISF road, running parallel to the STP belonging to UP Jal Nigam, in Indirapuram is completely inundated after the overnight rains. It is not only inhibiting traffic movement but has also become impossible for pedestrians to walk without wading through knee deep water. The presence of STP is the main reason behind such a mess and the GDA has so far failed to find a durable solution for it. Sarjit sat huddled in his hutment in the midst of knee deep water along CISF road. “This is not new as it happens every time it rains and also when it doesn’t,” said Sarjit, adding, “I am forced to stay here as I cannot just go elsewhere along with my shop. I am quite used to it.” When asked about the reason behind this issue, he said water discharged by the STP through uncovered drain spills over the roads. “There is so much water and with clogged drain it gets accumulated for about 500 metres, resembling a lake” said Sarjit. Alok Kumar, president of Fed AOA, said that no matter how many times they have written to the GDA, no concrete action has been taken by the authority. He added that the CISF road is a major arterial road and with the ongoing work at the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, the entire stretch remains in traffic jam and with stagnant water the situation only gets worse. “If you sit with an open window in your car, chances are that you will be drenched from the splash of passing vehicles,” said Kumar. On the other hand, GDA chief engineer VN Singh claimed that a lasting solution to the problem have been found. “We would replace the uncovered drain with pipes as a result of which water will not spill over and it would be channelised into the drain,” said Singh. “The work of laying the pipeline may well begin next month,” he added.

Lucknow,Arts College courses hit semester mode,"LUCKNOW: In an academic reform that promises to improve the quality of education at the 107-year-old Arts College, a semester system will be adopted from this academic session in all the four undergraduate and as many postgraduate courses. The decision was taken at the academic council meeting held on Wednesday. It is after almost five decades that a reform is being introduced in the college that has been facing acute financial crisis. The Arts College under LU will not only change its teaching pattern, but will also revise its syllabus on the lines of Visva-Bharati in Santiniketan while switching from annual exam to semester mode. “Last year, the semester system was introduced on trial basis at the undergraduate level. Based on the success, the decision to completely switch to semester mode has been taken for both UG and PG courses. The proposal was passed by the faculty board and now has been approved by the academic council,” said principal Sanjeev Kumar Gautam. Prof Gautam conceded that it had been decades since the Arts College had witnessed any major academic reform and the change would help the century-old college to be on a par with top fine arts institutions under other central and state universities. The syllabus, the principal said, will be divided into four units while internal assessments and assignments will be given to students every semester. He said the college would also seek NAAC tag. “Adopting a teaching pattern practised at other colleges across India will bring uniformity in the education system and make it easier for students to enrol elsewhere for higher education,” said LU vice-chancellor S P Singh.

Syed Raza Husain Zaidi, a member of Awadh Queer Pride, urged fellow citizens to free themselves from hatred and violence, and celebrate the country’s rich diversity. “The world has changed, but its needs have not. Are we really free? The country needs love, communication and a strong network of individuals to end violence,” the activist said. English student Soumya Nayyar, pursuing a BA programme at Delhi University, said for her, true freedom meant the azadi to go anywhere alone, without being judged or harassed. Travel bloggers Vishu and Saumya couldn’t agree more. They swore by the ‘live and let live’ mantra. “Freedom from fear is important. If you live in constant fear of being harmed — emotionally, physically or financially — are you free? We don’t think so. The day every man, woman and child can step out of home without fear and return safe, that day India will be truly independent,” Saumya spoke for both. Vasvi Verma, a TOI follower on Instagram, harped on broadening our horizons. Freedom will remain a distant dream if one has a narrow outlook, she said. “We need to open our minds. Mob lynchings must stop; freedom of speech and expression enshrined in our Constitution must be honoured; and people should get the liberty to choose how they wish to spend their lives. The day we attain these goals, we will be truly independent,” she added. "

I gave a proposal that they have land and we have manpower and if you start mechanised farming, the land can be used better. We can promote food processing and contract farming using Indian technology and manpower,” he said, adding that Russia had a huge scope to develop renewable energy as well, given how much unoccupied land it had.

Lucknow,I can’t stand beside a woman in a TV show like a property: Aniruddh Dave in Lucknow,"Aniruddh Dave was recently in the city to promote his on-air show. However, playing a father figure to a teenage girl in the show, Aniruddh says he is happy to get a meaty in a woman-dominated industry. ""I don’t mind playing a middle-aged man or playing a father figure to a teenage girl,"" says the actor, who’s enjoying the success of his latest stint on TV as Hanuman Singh in the serial 'Patiala Babes'. Reason? ""Well, because at least the storyline is focused on me. Male actors in television rarely get good roles in comparison to actresses. There are only a handful of male-centric shows on TV. Otherwise, in a typical fiction drama, a man is either standing beside a mother or a mother-in-law or his sister or wife or some other woman just like a property. And main aisa nahi kar sakta hoon, kahin na kahin mera jo craft hai and meri jo acting skill hai woh logon ko na dikhe toh mujhe bura lagta hai. I can’t stand beside a woman in a TV show like a property. It is then not worth acting. So, I always strive to do content in which I can showcase my craft. I’m fortunate ki mujhe bhar-bhar ke mauka mil raha hai which I’m very thankful for,"" adds he.

""Television is and will continue to remain women dominated in years to come. The reason behind it is the percentage of female viewers which is far more than the men. The female audience supersedes the male audience. And they search for themselves in the characters of the show and so that is why the sisters, mothers and wives of a show are more hit than the brothers, fathers and husbands."" And when the actor doesn’t get the role of his choice in films and serials, he says he always turns to his first love – theatre. ""I have been doing plays on and off. Idhar kuchh time se I am not able to give much time to the platform but otherwise theatre has always had a special place in my heart. In fact, even now I am practicing for a play which will be staged soon in Delhi,"" says he. Aniruddh Dave (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Aniruddh Dave (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Ask him about the theatre scene in the country and he says, ""If you talk about Lucknow, the city has a very good scene in terms of theatre; kaafi veteran log hain yahan se. Bhartendu Natya Akademi ke kaafi log Mumbai mein aaj bhi aate hain. Un actors mein itna confidence hota hai ke woh batate baad me hain ke woh BNA se hain usse pahle woh unki acting mein theatre background dikh jata hai. I must appreciate this. I’ve heard Surya Mohan Kulshreshtha and Anil Rastogi’s name a lot from Lucknow theatre. Surya Mohan sir ke toh bohut saare students aate hain idhar and no doubt unke craft mein jaan hai,” says he adding, “Jab tak corporate world aur commercial theatre bada nahi hoga...usmein bohut bade faces nahi honge tab tak thoda sa mushkil hai theatre ka survival. Jo payment karta hai and paise deta hai, jisse artiste ka pet bharta hai, toh woh uske tarike se kaam karta hai. And it is a very good sign ki corporates ki entry badh rahi hai theatre mein."" Aniruddh rode in the Lucknow Metro for the first time. Surprised by the work done by the Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation, he said he enjoyed the ride very much. The actor appreciated the artwork and graphics decorating the walls of the metro stations and loved them. ""The Lucknow Metro stations are so neat and clean. Plus the artistic approach towards building the stations is awesome. I was amazed to see that the stations' name were written in Urdu also. I am a frequent traveller of the metro in Jaipur, but Lucknow Metro is one of the best metros in India and now I just hope that Lucknowites maintain it. I am sure once all the phases of the metro in Lucknow are over and it is well connected, Lucknowites are going to use it. It was the need of the hour to have a metro in Lucknow because of the traffic scene all over the country. Even in Lucknow I have faced traffic congestion several times,"" he says.

Sengar, however, is yet to be proved guilty of rape and murder,” Tripathi said, while speaking to TOI. Sengar was expelled by BJP on August 1, amid nationwide outrage after the Unnao rape survivor, her lawyer and two aunts met with an accident on National Highway-31 in Rae Bareli on July 28, when their car crashed into a truck.

Lucknow,Sitapur jail warder under CBI lens for aiding Kuldeep Sengar,"LUCKNOW: The warder of Sitapur prison is under CBI scanner for allegedly allowing sacked BJP MLA and rape accused Kuldeep Sengar to smuggle cell phones into his barrack to call his henchmen in Makhi village. CBI is picking up clues on how Sengar’s aides would then receive orders to threaten the Unnao rape survivor’s family. Call records of jail warder Amar Singh reveal he was in touch with the expelled BJP MLA. The agency also stumbled upon 10 suspicious numbers from which calls were made from inside prison. CBI scanned details of 1,000 visitors to Sitapur jail, before zeroing in on the jail warder, who too is an Unnao native and was transferred to Sitapur jail last year. A senior CBI officer disclosed that a team would not only question the warder, but also launch searches on those whose names are registered against the 10 suspicious numbers. Two Sitapur jail warders, Mahendra Kumar Yadav and Satya Prakash Verma, were earlier transferred by the prisons department after a video went viral in which a panchayat member from Unnao came to meet Sengar in prison and a warder told him to visit after a fortnight. In his complaint to the police, Unnao rape survivor’s uncle alleged Sengar and his associates would hand out life threats to them at their residence in Makhi and also asked them to change their statements in court or hammer out a compromise.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Minutes after phone call, cop shoots self","GHAZIABAD: A 45-year-old senior sub-inspector allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with his service revolver on Friday morning, moments after he had shouted at a person over the phone. Madhup Singh’s wife said she was preparing breakfast at their home in Kavi Nagar when her husband got a call and started shouting at a person on the other end. His wife said she had asked him about the matter, but he declined to speak. Singh, originally from Allahabad, was posted at Baleni police station in Baghpat. He is survived by his second wife Abha and two children — son Raghav (7) and daughter Shakshi (12). Singh had lost his first wife to cancer nine years ago, and had married her cousin. Santosh Dixit, a family friend, said Singh had visited his house around 6.30am from Bagpath while he was on his way to drop his son to school. “Around 7.30am, he returned home and took a shower. A few minutes later, just before committing suicide, he got a call and was shouting over the phone,” he said. Though Singh’s wife asked him repeatedly the reason for his anger, he declined to speak about it. The police officer instead locked himself up in another room. “After a few seconds, a gunshot could be heard,” Dixit said. Neighbours broke open the door and found Singh lying on the floor, oozing blood. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said the alleged suicide took place around 8am, when Singh was getting ready for work. The officer did not leave behind any note. “The reason for the suicide was personal. However, investigations are underway. The body was sent for autopsy and the reports are awaited,” Kumar said. He added that the cops were trying to find out who Singh was talking to. Singh had joined UP Police as a constable in 2004 after his father, who was a sub-inspector, died. Singh had served in several police outposts in Ghaziabad. When he was posted in the GRP in Chandausi in 2015, his service revolver was stolen and an inquiry was conducted against him for alleged misconduct. His family believes Singh was denied a promotion because of this. In October 2018, Vijay Kumar, a sub-inspector posted in Kavi Nagar police station, had committed suicide in his quarters by shooting himself in the head with his service pistol. "
Lucknow,Historic Hazratganj crossing renamed after Atal Bihari Vajpayee,"LUCKNOW: The iconic Hazratganj intersection, set up by Nawab Amjad Ali Shah in 1842, was renamed ‘Atal Chowk’ on the first death anniversary of former Prime Minister and Lucknow MP Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The proposal to rename the intersection had been cleared by the executive committee of Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) last year. The LMC is also planning to install an idol of the statesman at Jhandiwala Park in Lalbagh. “Since Hazratganj crossing is the busiest and the most important in the city, it has been unanimously decided by executive body members to rename it Atal Chowk,” mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said. According to experts, Hazratganj is not just a prominent intersection, but also has historical significance. “The GPO crossing with the park was known as Badshah Chowk. GPO was the pavilion of George V of England, during the reign of Queen Victoria, who was his grandmother,” said historian Yogesh Praveen. “Given its rich legacy, naming it after a former Prime Minister is a welcome move,” he added.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Shelter kid dies in hospital, autopsy finds head injuries","LUCKNOW: An 18-month-old boy who lived at the state-run shelter on Prag Narain Road died at SPM Civil Hospital under mysterious circumstances on Wednesday night. While officials of Rajkiya Bal Grih claim the toddler was being treated for dehydration, police say the autopsy mentions internal head injury that resulted in coma. The district child welfare committee — a quasi-judicial body formed under the Juvenile Justice (Care &amp; Protection of Children) Act, 2015 — has ordered probe into the matter. According to shelter superintendent Manju Verma, the child had been living in the home for a year. He was found with his mentally unstable and pregnant mother in the streets. The woman delivered a baby girl who is now four months old. The siblings were housed in the Rajkiya Bal Grih while the mother was sent to a government shelter for women. Verma said the boy took ill on Wednesday morning. A doctor from Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) checked him around 7.30am. The doctor said he was suffering from dehydration and his condition was critical. He was rushed to RML hospital and from there referred to SPM Civil Hospital, where he died during treatment around 8.30pm (Wednesday), Verma maintained. Following protocol, the shelter reported the matter to police and the body was sent for post mortem. Station House Officer, Hazratganj, Radha Raman Singh said, “Autopsy has found internal head injuries, which resulted in coma and finally death.” Singh added that no case had been registered because police had not received any formal complaint. “We are waiting for the recommendation of the district administration, which is probing the matter.” Child welfare committee member Sangeeta Sharma told TOI that they were probing if there was any negligence on part of the shelter officials, which resulted in the untimely death of the toddler.

Lucknow,Day one: Flagship ITMS hits technical roadblock,"LUCKNOW: The ambitious Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS), inaugurated on Thursday, failed to take off on Day One. A TOI reality check on Friday revealed that CCTV cameras had been installed as promised at four major intersections — Hazratganj crossing, Indira Gandhi Pratishthan, Polytechnic on Faizabad Road and 1090 crossing. But, there was no live feed from these locations to the command centre. Also, the ITMS control room on the second floor of the command centre was still under construction and lying vacant. Workers said it would take some more time before the control room was fully equipped and operational. Conceptualised three years ago, the integrated system is meant to cover 152 crossings in the city. It is aimed at streamlining vehicular flow and enforcing traffic rules using CCTV cameras equipped with artificial intelligence. These cameras are expected to capture photographs of offenders and send it to the control room at the command centre, where staff can fish out details of the person using the registration number database and issue e-challans. In the first phase, the system was to be made effective at the four major crossings. As of now, a temporary set-up has been made on the command centre’s first floor that houses the Master System Integration (MSI) being used by Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) for single-window grievance redress. Three desktop terminals are in place for ITMS trials, but there is no one to operate them. Traffic police sub-inspector RK Singh, deputed for issuing challans, waited in vain for the system to be up and running. He left dejected around 1.30pm. Engineers at the site told TOI that there was some “connectivity problem” owing to which operations could not begin. Traffic ASP Purnendu Singh said at present they were conducting trials at four crossings, but conceded that it would take at least a month and a half to make the system fully operational. “There are some teething problems. These will be sorted out soon. Once the system is in place at the four crossings, we will cover the rest of the city in a phased manner,” he added. "
Lucknow,KGMU re-exam slotted before leak probe report,"LUCKNOW: King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has fixed August 21 as the re-examination date to select residents for the oral pathology and microbiology department. The scheduled has been announced without waiting for completion of an inquiry ordered into the alleged paper leak that had led to cancellation of the exam. The probe committee, asked to submit its report within a week, has not been able to finish the inquiry even three weeks later. The original test to select residents was held on July 21, but revoked four days later after the department head wrote to the vice-chancellor accusing a senior faculty member of engineering question paper leak. Some teachers were of the view that the university should wait for the probe report to ascertain if any candidate was guilty. Nevertheless, KGMU has slated the re-exam for August 21. All candidates who took the previous test can reappear. Controller of examination professor AK Singh said extra precautions had been taken to prevent another leak. On the status of the probe, KGMU spokesperson Sudhir Singh said statements of all parties had been recorded and evidence submitted by them were being analysed. "
Kanpur,Class 11 girl dies after stalkers drive bike over her head,"Lucknow: After the Unnao horror and suicide by Kanpur rape survivor last week, the chilling sequel of police apathy in Uttar Pradesh continued in neighbouring Sultanpur district, where cops kept their eyes wide shut for four days while a Class 11 girl student with a smashed skull died in hospital after stalkers allegedly drove their bike over her. The girl was returning home on a bicycle after school hours when she was stopped and assaulted by bike-borne molesters in Lambhua area of Sultanpur on August 8. The 16-year-old raised an alarm when the youths passed lewd remarks. Her screams drew a crowd and the bikers fled, said her family members. But hardly had the girl peddled 500m, when she was again intercepted by her stalkers, who pinned her to the ground and drove their bike over her head. Bystanders took her to the district hospital and informed her family. Talking to TOI, the girl’s grandfather said, “I shuttled between home and police station and pleaded with cops to register an FIR, but the Lambhua SHO paid no heed.” “On August 11, when the girl began to sink, she was referred to KGMU Trauma Centre in Lucknow. Here too, the doctors refused to treat her. We were forced to rush her to a private hospital, where she died on the night of August 14. Police took cognizance of my complaint on August 11, only after doctors at Sultanpur district said her condition was critical,” he said. The KGMU media in charge Sandeep Tiwari told TOI that the doctor on duty on the fateful night is on leave and sought time to clarify. “Don’t know why the three youths killed her, what was her fault. My grand-daughter was a brilliant student and never skipped school,” said the inconsolable grandfather. The doctor of a private hospital, who treated the school girl, said the girl suffered deep fractures on left side of the skull and multiple fractures on the body. “Such fractures happen when a bike or heavy vehicle runs over the body,” he told TOI on condition of anonymity. Talking to TOI, Sultanpur SP, Himanshu Kumar, said a senior IPS officer is probing the case. Kumar defended his force and said police acted on time. "

Lucknow,"Murder? SUV hit youths in third try, after 3km chase in Lucknow","LUCKNOW: Police investigation into Wednesday’s hit-and-run case, which left two youths dead and a third critically injured in Indiranagar, is veering away from accident and towards murder. After scanning footage from over 40 CCTV cameras, police have more or less formed the opinion that the SUV deliberately knocked down the three youths on a scooter. While Pawan Singh (22) and Tushar Singh (23) died on the spot, their friend Himanshu (24) is battling for life in hospital. Gazipur circle officer Deepak Singh on Saturday told TOI that the SUV was chasing the scooter from Munshipulia and was successful in hitting target in its third attempt. Findings of the preliminary probe corroborate suspicions of Pawan’s family who lodged a murder FIR, saying a group had attacked the youth with an iron rod on August 8, over a dispute involving a girl, and its members might have orchestrated the road accident. Police investigations have revealed that Pawan left his house with Tushar around 6.30pm on Wednesday. They were seen at a food corner in Munshipulia around 7.30pm. They left 30 minutes later, but returned around 9pm along with Himanshu. Around 9.15pm, Pawan’s mother called him and he told her he would be home soon. Fifteen minutes later, the three left the hangout and bought liquor from a nearby store. It is from there that the SUV began following the scooter. The hit-and-run took place near Aurobindo Park, some 3km away, around 10pm. “Footage from one camera shows the victims speeding on the wrong lane. It indicates they knew they were being followed. They were trying to get the SUV off their tail,” circle officer Singh said. Read this story in Bengali“The SUV tried to hit the scooter twice. On one occasion, a girl on a scooter came in front of the SUV and hence, it had to slow down. The SUV managed to hit the scooter in the third attempt,” the officer said. Police are scanning CCTV cameras installed near the liquor store to check if the victims were involved in a brawl. “The other possibility is that the attack was the fallout of an earlier dispute. We are waiting for Himanshu to make a statement and shed light on the matter,” Singh added. "

Lucknow,Lucknow: Newborn boy washes up in Kakori pond,"LUCKNOW: A baby boy, with the umbilical cord still attached, floated up dead in a pond near Dubagga Chowki in Kakori early on Saturday. Local residents informed police on Dial 100 after which a team fished out the body and sent it for postmortem. Kakori station house officer Pramod Kumar Mishra said it was not immediately clear if the baby died after being thrown into the pond or before that. Mishra , however, did not rule out the possibility of an unwed mother or her relative drowning the newborn. ""The baby was abandoned in the night. The umbilical cord was found attached, which means the baby was thrown into the water just hours after birth. The condition of the body suggests the baby boy was in water for 10-12 hours,"" the officer said, adding that decomposition had started and identification would be very difficult now. Police contacted nearby hospitals to inquire about births in the past couple of days, but did not get any ""useful information"" that could help them identify the newborn's parents or at least the mother.

Another local resident, Lokesh Rawat, said he had heard about people abandoning newborn daughters, but this was the first time he came to know about someone abandoning and throwing a baby boy into a pond.

Lucknow,Contaminated water puts over 1 lakh at risk: Survey,"LUCKNOW: Over one lakh residents living in seven localities are being supplied contaminated water putting them at the risk of an outbreak of water-borne diseases, shows a joint survey conducted by Jal Sansthan and the district health department. The team collected 70 samples from different parts of the city over the last 10 days, of which seven from Gomtinagar, Ravindrapalli, Lalbagh, Kadra, City Station and Indiranagar did not meet chlorination standards. The Jal Sansthan standard mandates that 0.2-0.4 microgram per litre chlorine be added to make water potable. Some of the samples even contained sand particles. “The lack of adequate chlorine indicates that either the disinfectant wasn’t added to the water before it was released from Jal Sansthan’s pumping stations or there were leakages in the pipelines,” said a senior health department officials. “In both cases, the water supply would have been contaminated with harmful microorganisms, which might lead to indigestion, diarrhoea, typhoid and various fungal infections,” said additional chief medical officer KP Tripathi. Jal Sansthan officials said that pumping stations have been instructed to ensure that adequate chlorine is added to the water supply. Besides, the agency also plans to launch a drive to spot leakages in pipelines and fix them. Meanwhile, residents of these areas said that they have been receiving contaminated water since mid-July. Narendra Kashyap, who lives on Jagat Narain Road in City Station area said that many residents in the locality had fallen ill due to jaundice and diarrhoea. “My sister too is suffering from jaundice since the past seven days and the doctor told us that it might be due to drinking contaminated water. We have started using alum (aluminium sulphate) to disinfect water or boil it before drinking,” he added. "

Lucknow,"Exploring love on the net, the queer way","Is cupid playing his role for his queer followers as he does for the straight ones? Looking at the number of dating apps burgeoning for the LGBTQ community, the answer seems to be ‘yes’. With Grindr, Blued, Tinder and Delta, among others, the window to diverse dating experiences has opened like never before. Lucknow boy Shubham, 26, was lucky to find his same-sex partner four years ago on a dating app designed for the LGBTQ community and the couple has been going strong since. “Just when I thought I had no chance at having a perfect partner, a mobile phone application exclusively for the LGBTQ community opened floodgates for me. I found my perfect match,” says Shubham, who now plans to adopt a child with his partner. Twenty two-year-old Yash, meanwhile, is still exploring the field. An active user of several of these apps, he says that each has a different purpose and following. “My experience tells me that one app is for more serious relationships while another is used mostly for casual sex. This isn’t to say that people are not looking for love or long-term alliances on it but they seem to be exploring all angles since it is an entirely new treasure,” he adds. What Yash is most thankful for is that there is finally a place for him to meet like-minded people without being judged. Ritu, a 20-year-old queer resident of Lucknow, however, had a relatively unpleasant experience on one of the apps. She signed up a year ago in the hope of a stable relationship but was disappointed. “Stability and love are not what these apps offer. I met people who made me feel unsafe...It was not a good place to be in,” she says, choosing not to elaborate but suggesting caution. Ritwik, 22, a queer activist who is also the founder of KHWAAB Foundation, a community-based organization that works for the welfare of LGBTQ community, says, “It is extremely disappointing to see how these apps are being used for the wrong reasons. They are serving as a medium for body shaming and blackmailing people.” Another Lucknowite, Lovepreet, has a practical outlook towards these apps. He says that it is foolish to expect “true love” on these as they mostly serve as a platform for casual relationships. He advises the queer community to join these apps for the fun of it and have their share of experiences without getting too attached. Whatever the case may be, these dating apps are leading to a sea of experiences and emotions for a community which was made to feel isolated until not very long ago. While there is still a long way to go, one is bound to reflect on the expanding inclusiveness of our city and its effort in making room for the LGBTQ community. "
Kanpur,Lucknow-Unnao may be seventh node on defence corridor,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow-Unnao could be notified as the seventh node in the UP defence corridor. Officials have sent a proposal to this effect to UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) and have also identified around 55 hectare land in Hasanganj tehsil of Unnao. “Currently, there are six nodes and we believe that a seventh one in Lucknow-Unnao should also be notified. We have identified land for it in Hasanganj tehsil, and have submitted a proposal to UPEIDA,” said Jagatraj Tripathi, adviser to UP government on defence corridor. The already notified nodes include Agra, Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, Kanpur and Jalaun. Land acquisition has already started in these nodes and more than 90% has already been acquired in Jhansi and Chitrakoot. Sources said that land allocation is expected to start in September, once the existing defence and aerospace manufacturing policy is revised. Officials said that efforts are on to bring the policy at par with that of Tamil Nadu, the second state where a defence corridor is proposed. The modified policy aims to push development of defence and aerospace parks in the state. It proposes a capital subsidy for development of these parks at 10% of eligible fixed assets, subject to a maximum of Rs 10 crore, provided that the park is developed in a minimum area of 50 acres. An additional capital subsidy of 50% will be given for parks being set up in Bundelkhand. “The proposed changes are in line with Tamil Nadu policy. The government will be giving options to investors to either set up a single unit or a park, like the existing IT Parks. Ancillary units like MSMEs manufacturing defence-related parts, operating and maintenance units and tier I-III manufacturing units can be set up,” said an official. So far, the government has not set any targets for single units or defence parks, he added. The defence parks are high capital intensive and hence UP would have to ensure that its policy is like or better than Tamil Nadu’s to make it attractive for investors, the official said. Under the existing policy, the incentives for defence parks are same as for setting up private industrial parks and there is no capital subsidy. "

Ancillary units like MSMEs manufacturing defence-related parts, operating and maintenance units and tier I-III manufacturing units can be set up,” said an official. So far, the government has not set any targets for single units or defence parks, he added. The defence parks are high capital intensive and hence UP would have to ensure that its policy is like or better than Tamil Nadu’s to make it attractive for investors, the official said. Under the existing policy, the incentives for defence parks are same as for setting up private industrial parks and there is no capital subsidy. "
Lucknow,"OMR sheet fudge: More Rajasthan, Bihar jobs under lens","LUCKNOW: Two more Rajasthan Subordinate and Ministerial Services Selection Board (RSMSSB) recruitment exams that were to be conducted have come under the scanner of UP Police’s special task force (STF) which arrested two employees of a Gomtinagar-based firm who promised selections in lieu of bribe. The same firm has also bagged the tender to conduct Bihar police constable recruitment and one more exam of Rajasthan state subordinate services. STF sleuths had on Friday arrested Vinod Kumar Gaur, Shadan Khan and their three aides, and seized Rs 62 lakhs in cash and OMR sheets from them. STF sleuths are now probing whether the accused also tried to rig other competitive exams. Additional superintendent of police (STF) Neeraj Pandey told TOI, “During interrogation, Gaur and Khan revealed that the firm they worked in was also conducting recruitment exams for Bihar Police constables and Rajasthan state subordinate services.” “We are writing to both states to verify if the accused were indulging in similar malpractices there also,” added Pandey. Senior STF officers have written to Rajasthan government to provide details of all candidates shortlisted in the examination. Investigations revealed that more candidates paid bribes for selection. All the exams conducted by the firm in past 101 years will be probed by STF, he added. The candidates paying bribes submitted blank OMR sheets to invigilators after examination. Khan took out the OMR sheets and gave them to Gaur who filled them up before being sent for evaluation. "
Lucknow,"Kashmir in their hearts, they made Awadh home","Seventy-year-old Akhlaq Haider has been reading the newspapers diligently for as many years as he can remember. But these days, the headlines from Kashmir are closer to his home in Lucknow’s Wazirganj area. For Haider and all other Kashmiris settled in Lucknow for generations, the connect between Kashmir and Lucknow is one that is as old as the city of Nawabs itself. Back in 1775, when Nawab of Awadh Asaf-ud-Daulah shifted base from Faizabad to Lucknow and made the city his capital, it is said that he got along with him a large group of Kashmiris—both Hindu and Muslims—and had them settled in Lucknow. From impressionists and storytellers who were called Kashmiri Bhaands, to carpet weavers, army generals and even ministers, Kashmiris had a place in all forays in the court of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah. Sharga Park in Kashmiri Mohalla“Our forefathers had come to Lucknow at the turn of the 18th century and settled around the area of Maqbara Alia Begum in Golaganj. In the early 1900s, they formed a group called Dast-e-Kashmiri Wazirganj, which mourned the events of Karbala and of Imam Husain and his family in a unique way, which is still popular in Lucknow and is a living tradition,” said Haider, a descendant of the first few Kashmiri Shias who made Lucknow their home. The group Haider referred to is allowed to take out a mourning procession in the name of Karbala on two occasions in the Islamic month of Muharram every year. “On the tenth day—Ashura—and the fortieth—Chehellum—our group performs the special matam which appears to be uniquely similar to the tribal people’s. We form a circle and holding on to each other’s waist, the matam is performed in unison,” he says. When Kashmiri Pandits accompanying Nawab Asafud-Daulah migrated to Lucknow with him, they settled together in what came to be known as and is still known as the Kashmiri Mohalla. Surrounded by beautiful gardens and water bodies, the Kashmiri Mohalla still houses the historic Kashmiri havelis occupied by descendants of the first Kashmiri Pandits to set foot on Lucknow’s soil. Two brothers, Laxmi Narayan Kaul Sharga and Niranjan Das Kaul Sharga, employed in the Mughal army, were taken to Faizabad from Delhi by Nawab Asafud-Daulah’s father Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah, when Faizabad was the Nawabi capital of Awadh. The valour of the brothers who fought in the battle of Buxar in 1764 against the British forces was rewarded in the form of royal wasika of 200 silver coins each per month to uphold their social status. With Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, their descendants moved to Lucknow and it was Durga Prasad Sharga, the son of Laxmi Narain, who is said to have taught Persian and Urdu to King Wajid Ali Shah. A scion of the family, BN Sharga, who wrote at least six volumes on the history of Kashmiri Pandits in Lucknow, mentions in his books how Lucknow played an important role in the many movements of the Kashmiri Pandits outside of the valley between the 18th and the 19th century. In one such volume, he writes about the historical Kashmiri shrine, ‘Bada Shivala’ built in Lucknow and located in Rani Katra area of old Lucknow. The temple, now famous as ‘Sankata Devi ka Mandir’ was, as Sharga wrote, built by Pandit Jwala Prasad Kaul Tankha, who came from Kashmir during Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah’s reign and then served as a dewan in his court. “It is said that when Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah started construction of the Asafi Imambara around 1777, his dewan Tankha simultaneously started construction work of ‘Bada Shivala’ in Rani Katra where he used to live at that time with a sizeable population of Kashmiri Pandits,” wrote BN Sharga, a much revered name from the community. Not just Pandits and Shias from Kashmir, it was also a Lucknowite who held an important post in the Sheikh Abdullah regime of Kashmir before India attained independence. His name was Mirza Jafar Ali Khan and he wrote poetry by the pen name ‘Asar Lakhnavi’. He had served as the education minister of Kashmir under Kashmir’s last prmie minister, Sheikh Abdullah. “He was a Padma Vibhushan awardee and served at several ministerial posts in the Kashmir government. He was for sometime also the officiating Prime Minister of Kashmir and was a loved poet who held both Kashmir and Lucknow close in his writings,” says his grandson Asif Qazalbash. "
Ghaziabad,"Land prices for RRTS corridor finalised, sent to UP government for nod","GHAZIABAD: The valuation of land for the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project has been finalised and sent to the UP government for the final approval. This was revealed by Meerut divisional commissioner Anita Meshram on Saturday after she took stock of the construction work of the corridor being undertaken by the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC).  ""The NCRTC had earmarked land parcel along the RRTS corridor, the ownership of which wrests with agencies and departments like the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC), the UP State Industrial Development Corporation, the irrigation department and others. Now the valuation of the land has been finalised in consultations with NCRTC and other stakeholders, and sent to the state government for its nod,"" she said.  Being built at a cost of over Rs 30,000cr, the 82-km-long Delhi-Meerut RRTS will have 22 stations in total, and trains will run at a speed of 180km per hour. This means one can commute from one city to the other in just 55 minutes. The UP government's share in the project is about Rs 6,500 crore. ""The state government will decide whether to adjust the cost of land in its Rs 6,500cr share or ask NCRTC to directly pay up the and cost to the departments and agencies concerned,"" said Meshram.  The RRTS corridor from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Modipuram in Meerut will have eight RRTS stations in Ghaziabad - Sahibabad, New Bus Adda, Guldhar, Duhai, Muradnagar, Modinagar (South) and Modinagar (North). The entire corridor is expected to become operational by March 2024, but a segment from Sahibabad to Duhai in Ghaziabad is likely to be made operational in March 2023. "
Kanpur,Buying an LDA flat? Brace for blackouts,"LUCKNOW: More than 50,000 flats being constructed on the outskirts of the city and over 6 lakh existing households in Aashiana, Jankipuram, Gomtinagar, Chinhat and Alambagh are staring at acute power crisis, thanks to shoddy planning. The Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) is raising new flats along Kanpur Road, Hardoi Road, Sitapur Road and Faizabad Road and in Gomtinagar extension. The projects are expected to be complete in a year after which the monthly power consumption will be 2.5 lakh kilowatt. However, no provision has been made to set up substations to facilitate uninterrupted electricity supply to these areas. “We need at least 12 power substations to meet the demand in these new areas. But, land has not been allotted to Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (LESA) for setting up substations. Under the circumstances, power will be supplied from the six nearest substations that cater to over six lakh households in Aashiana, Jankipuram, Gomtinagar, Chinhat and Alambagh,” said Sanjay Goel, the managing director of Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (MVVNL). Drawing power from the existing substations will result in overloading. This, in turn, will trigger breakdowns, tripping and other faults, leading to frequent outage and low voltage in the newly developed areas and in their adjoining localities. “So, we have decided not to give electricity connection to new flats till the LDA gives MVVNL around 36,000 square feet land for the 12 new substations,” Goel added. Earlier, the power utility had raised a similar demand for supply in newly developed areas of Gomtinagar, Gomtinagar extension, Jankipuram and Jankipuram extension. LDA officials maintained that they were scouting for vacant plots. “We are looking for land on city fringes and have also recognised some areas. We will hand over the land to the power firm so that substations can be set up. There will be no problem for newly built housing units or flats,” promised LDA chief engineer Indu Shekhar Singh. "

Lucknow,Samajwadi Party will not contest Haryana state polls,"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party (SP) will not contest the forthcoming Assembly elections in Haryana, but may lend support to any like-minded party in the neighbouring state. The Bahujan Samaj Party, however, had declared recently that it will be contesting the elections in Haryana along with a local party, Jannayak Janata Party, led by OP Chautala’s grandson Dushyant Chautala. Sources in SP said the party took the decision as it does not have a strong footprint in Haryana. SP had contested Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan but had failed to make any impact. BJP national president and Union Home minister Amit Shah kicked off his party’s campaign in the poll-bound state recently. Meanwhile, the SP top leadership is preoccupied with re-strategising the party’s plan for returning to power in UP in the 2022 Assembly elections. The party leadership has received reports of weak organisation at many districts, infighting and sulking leaders. "
Kanpur,Cadaver organ harvest plan in coma at KGMU,"LUCKNOW: For liver cirrhosis patient Sunil Trivedi, the only chance of survival is a transplant within six months. Since his kin are not fit for donation, the 43-year-old has hopes pinned on the revival of the deceased donor transplant programme at King George’s Medical University (KGMU). Like Sunil, 23 chronic liver patients who need transplant within six to 12 months are on the waiting list of KGMU, which can facilitate 100 cadaveric multi-organ donations (CMOD) a year and save at least 125 lives. On June 26, after a gap of 10 months, the premier state-run institute had conducted a CMOD, but thereafter the donor programme lost steam amid dearth of logistics support and missing co-ordination among departments “When life-saving programmes are suspended, people are compelled to look for unauthorised means,” Sunil said in tacit reference to the multi-state organ racket recently busted in Kanpur. According to the law, only blood relations can donate organs. If they are found medically unfit, patients in dire need are misled into buying organs from illegal sources, admitted doctors, adding that the deceased donor transplant programme could alone curb the illegal organ trade. Each CMOD can save a few lives, as the liver, kidneys and corneas can be reused. According to a 2016 KGMU study, at least 100 cases of brain deaths are reported in various departments every year. Even if 25% of these are used for CMOD, it can save around 125 lives a year. The donation rate, which is 5% at present, can be increased five times by improving infrastructure, sensitising medical staff and through community education. The deceased donor transplant programme began at KGMU in December 2014. Multiple organs were retrieved from 20 brain-dead patients in three years till 2017 and sent to various hospitals, saving lives of 100 patients. Only two have taken place since then. A patient is declared brain-dead after the confirmatory ‘Apnea test’ comes positive two times, six hours apart. Counsellors then try to convince the family of the deceased for donation, but many are reluctant owing to religious beliefs. At the same time, a brain-dead patient is not removed from the ventilator because that could lead to cardiac arrest, thereby stopping the flow of blood in the body, which will turn the organs unfit for use. However, at KGMU, shortage of ventilators in the trauma care unit (20 against a requirement of 40) and delay in diagnosing brain deaths, due to lack of awareness among medical staff, have been found to be major impediments for the programme. When contacted, KGMU officers said the administration was working out a plan to resolve issues. Chief medical superintendent SN Shankhwar said, “Besides procuring more ventilators, we are training our staff for better results. We have the potential to run the programme successfully” Vice-chancellor MLB Bhatt said, “We have not stopped the programme and have infrastructure and expertise to run it. Organ donation is a sensitive issue for people and requires counselling and self-motivation.” "

Lucknow,UP: Road accident victims may get government aid for treatment,"LUCKNOW: People sustaining grievous injuries in road accidents may now get financial help from government for initial treatment. Many victims of road accidents brought to hospitals fail to get initial treatment, as most of the times they are brought to hospitals by police or commuters. Since they are not in the position to deposit fee for medical tests it affects treatment in the golden hour (the crucial one hour immediately after an accident). To do away with the practice and facilitate initial treatment, the government may provide Rs 25,000 or more to every such person, according to officials. “The money might be provided from road safety fund. The move is yet to be given a final shape,” said additional transport commissioner, road safety and IT, Gangaphal. The scheme will be implemented by the health department and hospitals may either be provided with a consolidated fund for the purpose or may have to fill up a form and submit with the transport department, after treatment, to get the money. Once the patient’s family arrives to his side, it can fend for other expenses. Meanwhile, the final decision on the state government’s scheme to give Rs 2,000 as incentive to people bringing those injured in road accidents to hospitals is expected by the first week of August.

The survivor said that while her advocate, who was driving the car, tried his best to put the vehicle in reverse gear so as to get out of the truck’s way, the truck rammed their car, the relative told TOI on Sunday over phone from Delhi. The advocate is also admitted at AIIMS and is still in an unconscious state. Along with her advocate and two aunts, the survivor was on her way from Unnao to the Rae Bareli jail when the truck collided with their car on July 28 afternoon. She lost both her aunts in the accident. The survivor, who is now 19, has accused now-expelled BJP MLA from Bangarmau Kuldeep Singh Sengar of raping her two years ago. Sengar is in the CBI custody and is being tried at a Delhi court at present. “I asked her what had happened and she told me she saw the truck coming straight towards them and colliding head-on. They had even raised an alarm when they realised that there was something unusual in the way the truck was being driven,” said the relative, whose mother had died in the accident. This relative has been by the survivor’s bedside, first at KGMU-Lucknow and now at AIIMS, since the day of the accident. “She also told me how her advocate had tried to put the car in reverse gear, so that they could be saved from the truck moving towards them. But he was unable to do so as the truck sped towards them,” the relative told TOI in an exclusive conversation. After gaining consciousness, the survivor, who is still critical, could manage to share a few details of the day to her relative. However, the CBI, which is investigating both the rape and the accident cases, has not been informed of these details yet. “She has shared this with me alone as she has been living with me ever since she left Unnao out of fear following the rape. She refused to meet CBI officials, who once came to meet her at AIIMS,” the relative said. As per the relative, the survivor has lost faith in the CBI. “She says she does not trust even the CBI now after losing all faith in the UP government. She had told the CBI several times about the threat to her life and yet no measures were taken to safeguard her,” the relative added. “The survivor has told me that ever since the state government transferred the rape case to the CBI in April last year, the agency sleuths had asked her the same questions over and over again, but failed to expedite the process of justice,” said the relative.

Lucknow,Clerk in burgled home waits six days for Lucknow cops to finally act,"LUCKNOW: Burglars broke into the house of a clerk in Ganna Sansthan and decamped with cash and jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh in Indiranagar. The incident took place on August 11 but the police registered the case on Saturday, six days after the incident. According to police, Sunil Kumar Singh (50), a native of Azamgarh, lives on the ground floor of the house along with his wife and two children. His brother and sisters live with their families on the remaining two floors of the house. On August 11, Kumar left for Azamgarh with his family to perform the 'tehravi' of his father, who had passed away on July 31, locking all the three floors of the house. Kumar received a call from his neighbour early on August 12 morning who informed him that the lock of the main door of his house was broken. He returned to Lucknow the same day at around 2pm and found that burglars had taken away Rs 10,000 cash and gold and diamond jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh from an almirah in the bedroom of the ground floor. Swati (48), wife of Sunil Singh, said no CCTV camera was installed in their alley. ""We have scanned the footages of the CCTV cameras in our vicinity but have not found anything specific. The burglars took away jewellery that I had been collecting since my marriage about 20 years ago,"" she said. ""We called the local police station on August 12 but they asked us to register an online FIR but we were unable to do so as the registration kept failing. The same thing happened on August 13 and 14. We went to the police station on August 15 but the police said they will register the case after two days.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: 7-year-old slapped by uncle for not taking meat home dies,"GHAZIABAD: A seven-year-old girl died allegedly after being slapped by her uncle in Khoda Colony because she had taken some meat on Bakrid (August 12) to her mother instead of delivering it to his place. Police said when the accused, Saleem (30), came to know that the meat had not been brought to his home, he slapped Laiwa so hard that she fell and her forehead hit the staircase. She died on the spot. Saleem, police said, hid her body in a plastic bag and dumped it in a drain near NH-9. The body was noticed on Saturday by a passer-by, who informed police about it. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said the girl’s maternal uncle had lodged a kidnapping case at Khoda police station last Tuesday, a day after she went missing. Kumar said several teams had been formed to investigate the case after the body was recovered. More than 100 people, including the girl’s relatives from the locality, were questioned. During sustained interrogation, Salim broke down and confessed to committing the murder, he said. Laiwa’s father Maskoor and mother Nasreen have been living separately in the same colony apparently because of the former’s addiction to drugs. Salim’s house is also nearby. On Bakrid, Salim and other residents were busy performing the sacrifice of goats and buffaloes near his house. Salim had collected some buffalo livers in a container and asked Laiwa, who was standing nearby, to deliver them to his house, Kumar said. Laiwa apparently misunderstood the instruction and took the meat to her mother’s house instead. Around 12pm, Salim got a call from his house saying the meat had not reached home yet. He called up Nasreen and came to know that the meat had been taken there by Laiwa. When Salim’s father Mahmood came to know about it, he scolded him for his carelessness. This infuriated Salim and he started looking for Laiwa. Police said he found the girl playing with other children on the roof of his father’s house. He asked the other kids to leave the place and then scolded Laiwa for not taking the meat to his house. In a fit a rage, he hit her in the face and she fell on the stairs. As Salim realised that Laiwa had stopped breathing, he stuffed the body in a sack and hid it under a bed in the room of the girl’s father and locked it from outside, police said. Around midnight, he took out the body and dumped it in the drain. A few neighbours had seen him take out the sack, but he apparently told them it contained animal wastes. Police said that to avoid suspicion, Salim had even participated in the search for Laiwa. After the body was recovered on Saturday, Salim was trying to escape from Khoda when he was nabbed. "

Lucknow,Lucknow government school kids to raise own kitchen garden,"LUCKNOW: Students of government-run schools will now raise their own kitchen garden and eat fruits and vegetables they choose to grow. Ministry of human resource development (MHRD) has issued instructions to all government schools up to Class 8 to include the produce from the kitchen garden in mid-day meal. ""When children will work hard to grow vegetables and are asked to eat it, the vegetable will taste different to them for the simple reason that they would already have had developed a connect,"" said sources in the state government, adding that the idea was to boost the nutritive value of mid-day meal. MHRD will allocate Rs 5,000 per year per school for the purpose and each school will have to work out its own plan considering what variety of vegetables or fruits can be grown in the locality. Mid-day meal has already been a turnaround story for primary school education provided by government in the country and adding a vegetable to the mid-day meal will further boost the scheme. The schools that do not have land available can raise a terrace garden and use pots, containers or bags. The gardens will have to be managed by children mainly with the help of staff and teachers. In UP, it will be done with the help of the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH). ""We are seeking expert advice to make proper use of fund so that money is not wasted due to lack of planning,"" an official said. About 2,500 schools in the state already have their kitchen garden raised by teachers and students much before these instructions came. Such schools can play a major role in helping others on deciding things like who would take care of the garden when the school is closed. The state government will organise a workshop at Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) in the first week of August wherein teachers, staff and students of some of the schools will be called and their doubts, if any, cleared. They will also be taught gardening. Director, CISH, Shailendra Rajan, said: ""The workshop will also guide participants on collective growing of vegetables and fruits on the land available to them."" Besides improving the nutritive value of mid-day meal, it will also make children aware of seasonal vegetables. The activity may also bring a change in the food habits of the families of these children,"" Rajan said. "

Kanpur,Coal-based power makes India top global SO2 emitter: Greenpeace,"NEW DELHI: Sulphur dioxide (SO2), a significant contributor to air pollution, may be within the national ambient air quality standard in all major cities in India, but the country is the largest cumulative emitter of this pollutant in the world and thus prone to being a victim of a cocktail of several toxic air pollutants. As a reactive pollutant, SO2 reacts with other air pollutants to form sulphate particles and makes a significant part of particulate matter (PM2.5), which has the largest public health impact. It is estimated that SO2 commonly makes up more than 10% of the deadly fine particles in India and China. Though Russia’s Norilsk smelter complex is the largest individual SO2 emission hotspot, India figured at the top, contributing more than 15% of all anthropogenic sulphur dioxide globally in 2018. The primary reason for the country’s high emission output is the expansion of coal-based electricity generation over the past decade. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.These are the findings of a new report by Greenpeace, a global environmental NGO, which analysed sulphur dioxide hotspots detected by US space agency Nasa’s OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite. It shows Russia is the second largest cumulative emitter of sulphur dioxide followed by China, Mexico, Iran, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. The Greenpeace study, released on Monday, finds that Singrauli, Neyveli, Talcher, Jharsuguda, Korba, Kutch, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Ramagundam and Raigarh are the major SO2 emission hotspots in India. Analysis of ambient air quality data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India’s national pollution watchdog, however, shows that sulphur dioxide levels were within the acceptable limits in all 50 major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Pune and Kanpur, in the country during 2016-18. Asked for explanation, clean air analyst and one of the authors of this report, Sunil Dahiya, said, “Although SO2 concentration monitored directly across cities in India might show low values, being a reactive pollutant, it converts to sulphates very quickly, making a significant part of secondary PM2.5, which has proven to be a major health risk across the world, leading to millions of deaths”. Citing an example, he told TOI that the IIT Kanpur report on air pollution in Delhi, compiled in 2015, also highlighted this fact by mentioning that 90% reduction in SO2 from power plants within 300km of the capital will result in reduction of approximately 35 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5. The report noted that among the major emitters of SO2, China has been able to reduce emissions rapidly by dramatically improving emissions standards for its power plants and enforcing sulphur dioxide controls. “This report makes it clear that we cannot give coal power plants a free hand to continue polluting and keep leading to a health emergency situation in India due to air pollution,” said Pujarini Sen, senior campaigner at Greenpeace, in a statement.

Ghaziabad,"Consumer panel orders refund, but no response from builder","GHAZIABAD: The woes of a group of homebuyers, who had bought flats in KDP Grand Savanna in Raj Nagar Extension in 2012, are far from over despite two different orders issued from the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to the builder to pay compensation to the homebuyers.  In 2016, a group of 18 homebuyers had filed a petition in SCDRC, after the builder KDP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd failed to give the possession of flats which was due on March 2012. Vinay Verma, one of the petitioners, said, “The allotment letters were also issued to us after we paid 95% of the basic sale price to the builders before the possession date. We kept pursuing the case and in 2015 the builder promised to hand over the possession in July 2016, but it was not kept. Consequently, we approached the SCDRC and filed a petition seeking compensation for the delay besides immediate handover of the flats.” In February 2018, the state commission directed the builder to hand over possession of flat to respective allottee within three months.

The petitioners said the RC was issued in July this year, but they are yet to get any response from the builder.

Ghaziabad,GDA bids again to block registries of illegal flats on single-unit plots,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) is making yet another attempt to block registries of illegal flats on single unit plots in its colonies. In a meeting on Monday, the GDA vice-chairperson requested the registry department to seek NOC from the development authority before going ahead with registries of flats on single unit plots. But KK Mishra, AIG stamps, told chairperson Kanchan Verma that there is no such provisions in the registry manual. “We had recently carried out a survey in the Indirapuram township and we were shocked to find out that there has been flagrant violations of building bylaws under which more than prescribed dwelling units have been constructed on single unit plots. More than 264 such violations have come to our notice in Indirapuram township alone,” said Kanchan Verma, the GDA vice chairperson. “We have to do something about it and apart from imposing fines and even lodging FIRs.

Last year, a similar situation cropped up when then district magistrate of Ghaziabad, Ritu Maheshwari, had stopped registries in illegal colonies and the matter reached the Allahabad high court, which gave its decision against Maheshwari. The GDA had, in January 2015, allowed construction of multiple housing units on single unit plot properties and gave special relaxation to developers in colonies like Rajendra Nagar, Indirapuram, Kaushambi, Swarn Jayanti Puram, Shalimar Garden extensions 1 and 2, Shalimar Garden (main) and Pratap Vihar.

Ghaziabad,Living in Ghaziabad? Your water bill may go up significantly,"GHAZIABAD: Residents may have to shell out significantly more for water if a proposal by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) comes into effect. Till now, residents have been paying a water tax — a flat 10% of the annual rental value of the property. The new proposal, which came up for the discussion at its executive committee meet on Monday, has suggested the introduction of a water charge, which will not only take 10% of the annual rental value into account, but also the influx based on the pipeline diameter. If it comes into effect, the proposed water charge in residential areas will vary from Rs 1,050 to Rs 7,680. For commercial establishments, it will be between Rs 32/kilolitre and Rs 96/kilolitre. Anand Tripathi, executive engineer, water works department, GMC, said, “So far, we have been taking water tax calculated at 10% of annual rental value of the property, but now we are planning to introduce a water charge.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.“The charge has been computed on the basis of annual rental value charge and diameter of the pipeline that supplies water to a household which has been placed under three slabs — 15mm, 20mm and 25mm,” he added. Tripathi said that a panel will be formed to assess the proposal and place its report before the GMC’s board meeting before it is finally implemented. In other key decisions, the executive committee also approved a proposal to hike fines on illegal parking by four times at 14 spots in the city. The GMC had recently surveyed areas notorious for the menace and in a report had identified the spots, which are mostly in front of big industries. “The parking fine is computed on the basis of GMC area occupied,” said AK Mishra, a GMC official. The committee also decided to mortgage 36,000 sqm of its land in Bhojna village worth Rs 201.6 crore for floating municipal bonds to fund its projects. Besides this, it also gave the go-ahead to give away 4,000 sqm of land in Hindon Eco park to National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project. Also, a proposal to develop a park on a 28-acre land near Mahamaya Stadium was passed by the executive committee.

Lucknow,Man makes hoax call to teach 'lazy' Lucknow civic body a lesson,"LUCKNOW: Karma is the sweetest revenge, but it has no deadline. So, a city businessman decided to take matters into his own hands. Annoyed over Lucknow Municipal Corporation's (LMC) sloth in redressing his past complaints about unattended garbage, Jankipuram Sector-C Sanjay Singh pulled off a prank on Tuesday that the civic authorities will perhaps remember for a lifetime. A year ago, Singh approached the LMC through its integrated grievance redressal system cell several times to complain about accumulating trash outside his residence. But, no help came. Finally, local residents paid from their own pockets to hire workers and get the area cleaned. Recently, the businessman heard that the Smart City command centre - a single-window system to redress civic grievances - was addressing complaints within hours. He called the control room and registered a false complaint about garbage being dumped in the open. Staff at the command centre quickly forwarded the gripe to LMC, which in turn rushed its sanitation workers to collect the trash and install a dustbin. The cleaning squad reached the area only to realise it was a hoax call.

Lucknow,"Heads roll in cabinet, stage set for Yogi Adityanath’s first big churn today","LUCKNOW: Emboldened by the party’s sweep in Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath sought resignations of four ministers, including finance minister Rajesh Agarwal, before enacting a massive churning of his team. When his ministers will be sworn in at 11am in Raj Bhawan on Wednesday, it will be his first and perhaps the last cabinet expansion before he hits the 2022 hustings. The reshuffle due on Monday was postponed due to lack of unanimity between government and the party organisation over sacking of some ministers. Once the names were decided, the chief minister gave the green signal for the much-touted reshuffle. Those shown the door to pave way for new faces include ministers Rajesh Agarwal, Anupma Jaiswal and Dharam Pal Singh, among othersIn the purge and promotion exercise, five ministers put in their papers late Tuesday to pave way for around 12 new faces, though the final list was still being discussed at a private resort on outskirts of the state capital past midnight. In another likely development, one senior minister could be made deputy chief minister, raising the total number of Yogi’s deputies to three — in a near-embrace of the YSR Reddy’s Andhra Pradesh model of five deputy CMs for a deft balancing act.

Those shown the door to pave way for new faces include ministers Rajesh Agarwal, Dharam Pal Singh, Anupma Jaiswal, Archana Pandey. The list also includes name of state BJP president Swantantra Dev Singh, who has already put in his papers. A powerful leader in party wanted to protect two controversial ministers, but the CM’s will prevailed. Those likely to get ministerial berths are Union defence minister Rajnath Singh’s son Pankaj Singh, Satish Dwivedi, Anil Sharma, Nileema Katiyar, Ashish Singh Aashu, and Anil Sharma. Anil Rajbhar, who is being projected as the party’s Rajbhar leader, may be elevated. Since many MLCs, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, and Mohsin Raza are already in government, chances are that only Vidhya Sagar Sonkar, an MLC, could make debut and most berths would go to MLAs. In deliberations, BJP and RSS had also agreed to give representation to all castes, communities and regions in UP. Yogi did not have much freedom to select his team when he came to power in 2017, and ministers were decided by BJP president Amit Shah. The manner in which Yogi has effected a purge, makes it clear that he is weeding out those who caused embarrassment by their acts of omission and commission. Finance minister, Rajesh Agarwal, who had been in news for his long-drawn battle with his principal secretary, Sanjiv Mittal, over transfers and postings, also seems to have run out of favour. Agarwal wanted Mittal to be removed, but Yogi put his foot down. Officially, Agarwal claims he tendered resignation as per party policy since he turned 75 recently.

Jaiswal, who was BJP state secretary before she became MLA in 2017, had courted controversy on several occasions in her tenure. In a statement that left the party embarrassed, she once said that ministers spent nights at homes of Dalits despite being stung by mosquitoes. Jaiswal’s tenure was marked by massive delays in distribution of uniforms and sweaters to students, forcing even the high court to intervene at one point. The distribution of sweaters could not be completed in 2017-18 winter while distributed material, like socks, was found to be of extremely poor quality. Finance minister Rajesh Agarwal, who made his resignation letter public, claimed he was quitting due to his age in accordance with BJP policy of retiring ministers above 75 years. Agarwal, who recently turned 75, is an MLA from Bareilly and has also been deputy speaker from 2003 to 2007.

Lucknow,UP timber mafia beats 90-minute car chase,"LUCKNOW: A violent encounter with the timber mafia in Maharajganj in the small hours of Tuesday left a ranger injured, an enforcement vehicle gasping for fuel after a 90-minute chase and the forest department red in the face with the realisation that it is anything but prepared to take on organised crime on its own turf. As a face-saver the department has lodged an FIR against unidentified persons at Pakri range police station under Maharajganj forest division. DFO Pushpa Kumar said they acted on a tip-off that a truckload of timber might be whisked away from Laxmipur range by 3am. Three field officers and others entered the range close to Monday midnight and spotted the truck loaded with logs on the periphery of the core area. “Our men chased the truck. It stepped on the pedal and took a circuitous route. Members of the mafia also opened fired. Forest officials retaliated,” DFO Kumar said, adding that other ranges of Maharajganj forest division were also asked to cordon off the area. Laxmipur ranger DS Tiwari tried to stop the truck by blocking its way with his vehicle. The truck didn’t stop. It instead ploughed through his vehicle, leaving him grievously injured. “His condition is stable now,” the DFO said. The timber truck could not be intercepted because the forest department vehicle ran out of fuel after a 90-minute chase. Officials have no clue how many people were inside the truck and how much timber was taken away. They also don’t know what quality of timber was smuggled out. The incident shows how ill-prepared the forest department is when it comes to keeping timber gangs at bay. These organised crooks are equipped with better weapons and vehicles, and are well aware of every nook and corner of forests, posing a constant threat to both forest wealth and wildlife. “It is a serious incident. We have reported the matter to the higher-ups in the department,” said CCF (wildlife east), Gonda, Sujoy Banerjee. The department is investigating the incident. "

With the expansion, the total strength of the Yogi government, including the chief minister, has now risen to 56. In a show that marked CM consolidating his grip over government and party, every minister touched the feet of Yogi Adityanath and Governor Anandiben Patel and sought their blessings, after taking oath of office and secrecy. The Gandhi auditorium reverberated with chants of “Bharat Mata ki Jai” and “Har Har Mahadev” after the swearing-in of each minister.

It was her first public programme since she took over from Ram Naik on July 29. Chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey conducted the ceremony that was also attended by top bureaucrats. Of 23 ministers sworn-in, six took oath as cabinet ministers, another six as minister of state (independent charge) and 11 as minister of state. The new cabinet ministers are Mahendra Singh, Suresh Rana, Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary, Anil Rajbhar, Ram Naresh Agnihotri and Kamla Rani Varun, while Neelkanth Tewari, Kapildev Agarwal, Satish Dwivedi, Ashok Katariya, Shri Ram Chauhan and Ravindra Jaiswal were inducted as ministers of state (independent charge). The new ministers of state are Anil Sharma, Mahesh Gupta, Anandswarup Shukla, Vijay Kashyap, Giriraj Singh Dharmesh, Laakhan Singh Rajput, Neelima Katiyar, Chaudhary Udaibhan Singh, Chandrika Prasad Upadhyaya, Ramashanker Patel and Ajit Singh Pal. Of the six new cabinet ministers, four — Mahendra Singh, Suresh Rana, Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary and Anil Rajbhar —were already ministers of state with independent charge and were apparently promoted after the chief minister was impressed with their performance. Ghatampur MLA Kamla Rani Varun and Bhongaon (Mainpuri) MLA Ram Naresh Agnihotri were the two fresh faces inducted in the team as cabinet ministers. CM Yogi and the party have also done a caste balancing act. Among the 23 ministers taking oath, 10 are OBC, six Brahmins, three SC, two Vaishyas and two Rajputs. A smiling chief minister was accompanied by his deputies, Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, and key faces of his government and state party unit. It was first cabinet expansion by Yogi since he formed his government in March 2017. The reshuffle had his stamp of approval as he showed the way out to controversial and tainted hands while his forming his new team. In 2017, when Yogi had become chief minister, he was handed a list of ministers to be sworn in and had no choice since he was himself named at the last minute. In his first expansion, Yogi has asserted that he will run the government in his own way while not compromising with the incompetent and tainted and giving young hands a chance to prove and perform. Barring a few like Ashok Katariya, who is perceived as an inner member of party’s powerful general secretary Sunil Bansal’s coterie, most ministers are of Yogi’s choice and are loyal to him. For example Satish Dwivedi, MLA from Itwa, Siddharthnagar, had defeated then speaker Mata Prasad Pandey and has special blessings of the chief minister. Similarly, Mahendra Singh, whose performance in the rural development department has been praised even by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was elevated to the rank of cabinet minister by the chief minister. The distribution of portfolios has not been announced so far and is being discussed and finalized by a high-level coordination committee comprising the chief minister, his two deputies Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma and RSS and party functionaries. Though the name of MLA Pankaj Singh, son of defence minister Rajnath Singh was being widely discussed as one of the probables, he was not inducted in the cabinet. Except Swatantradev Singh, who resigned after taking over as the new BJP chief in the state, Rajesh Agarwal, Anupama Jaiswal, Archana Pandey, Dharam Pal Singh had courted controversies causing embarrassment to the Yogi government. While there was widespread enthusiasm and excitement among those sworn-in as new ministers and their supporters, there were some sombre faces too on being left out from the list. "

Ashok Sinha tried in vain to save his favourite couch from floating goo. And, the gushing water reminded Gursimran Singh Saluja how he was marooned for 12 straight hours without power a few years ago. These are just a few of the umpteen challenges residents of Aashiana grappled with between Tuesday and Wednesday as night-long downpour sent two-thirds of the city underwater. A flawed drainage system has been Aashiana’s biggest bane for 15 years now. It barely takes 30 minutes of heavy rain to turn the area into a giant lake, albeit a dirty one. Frustrated with civic inaction, some residents seek temporary shelter elsewhere during monsoon while others have added floors to escape the filth and the fear of creepy crawlies that the rainwater may transport into their homes. “As rainwater mixed with sewage gushed into our home, we sat on the bed through the night. This happens almost every year,” said Shukla, a resident of Sector H, Aashiana. The LMC had deployed two pumps to drain out water, but these have been out of order for long.

Lucknow,Tattoo artist drowned by accident: Forensic science laboratory,"LUCKNOW: The forensic science laboratory (FSL) has submitted its report to Chinhat police in the Gurpreet Singh death case, stating that the 30-year-old tattoo artist had accidentally drowned in Indira Canal. Police, however, will wait for the viscera report to rule out foul play once and for all. Singh, alias Guppi, was picnicking with a friend near the canal on March 27 when he drowned. Based on his family’s complaint, a case of murder was lodged against his friends Amrita Rathore and Sanket Agnihotri. Chinhat SHO Sachin Singh said forensic experts had recreated the crime scene and come to the conclusion that Guppi drowned by accident. “The FSL report states that if someone falls from a height of around 14ft into a 12ft-deep canal in an inebriated state, it may be difficult for him/her to navigate in the water and surface without support,” Singh said, adding, “However, we need the viscera report to verify if the tattoo artist was indeed tipsy at the time of the incident.” Accused Amrita, in her statement to police, said they had had beer that day. “I decided to take a dip in the water, but slipped. Gurpreet saved me, but himself drowned,” she said, adding that she had called Sanket later to search for Guppi.

Ghaziabad,GDA to invite agencies to prepare green plan,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) will invite expression of interest (EOI) from agencies by next week for preparing an environmental management plan for the city.

On June 7, a meeting was held and IIT professor Pramod Kumar had told stakeholders that a plan had been prepared for the entire city. Mittal had objected to it saying NGT had ordered the CPCB and UPPCB to prepare a plan to deal with pollution-related issues in Kaushambi in particular. But there was no mention of the area in the interim report. The report was not approved and it was decided GDA would select another agency. "

The notice says GDA should take action to mend the road in front of DPS Indirapuram where two cave-ins were reported in a week. The notice also sought an inquiry against the contractor entrusted with the responsibility to carry out the repair and action against GDA officials under whose watch the work was done. “We’ve been asking the GDA since March to repair roads and sewer line at Ahinsa Khand 2 but to no avail,” said Alok Kumar, president, Fed AOA. “We, through our lawyer, issued a notice to GDA saying if the work is not completed soon, we’ll approach the high court,” Kumar added. The road near the school had caved in recently during rain. “It happened while school buses were ferrying children,” said DK Pandey, from Arihant Harmony. “GDA had asked the private developer to place sand bags to prevent mudslide. But within six days of that, another cave-in was reported.” Fed AOA’s lawyer Prashant Kanha said under UP Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973, they’re within the rights to issue a legal notice.

The court, while hearing the matter, invoked Right to Education Act and observed that “GDA sealing the educational institution was not justified in the facts and circumstances of the case”. The court while issuing orders to unseal the school building said ‘we direct GDA vice chairperson to remove the seal forthwith and consider the application of compounding expeditiously.’ Reacting to the HC order GDA vice chairperson Kanchan Verma said that the authority in accordance with court’s order had lifted sealing from the school. “Following HC order we immediately lifted sealing of St Xaviers School in Morta but since the sealing in the first place was carried out because the building had no map approval we will contest the case” said Kanchan Verma.

Ghaziabad,Five men die working in 14-ft-deep manhole in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: In yet another shame for Delhi-NCR, four labourers and their supervisor died of suspected asphyxiation after they went inside a 14-foot-deep manhole at Nandgram’s Krishna Kunj colony here without any safety gear on Thursday afternoon. The workers were trying to connect the one-and-a-half-foot-wide manhole to an under-construction sewer line in the area. The work was being carried out by the UP Jal Nigam through a private contractor under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. An FIR has been filed and four Nigam officials suspended. The victims have been identified as Damodar, 40, Horil, 35, Sandeep, 30, Shiv Kumar, 32, and their supervisor, Vijay Kumar, 40. They were all from Sighia block in Samastipur district of Bihar. Sandeep, Shiv Kumar and Vijay were related to each other. The tragedy follows a series of such deaths in Delhi and its neighbouring cities. The last major incident happened last September, when too five men had died while cleaning a sewer in West Delhi’s Moti Nagar.

The firm has been blacklisted and barred from participating in any government tendering process. Four Jal Nigam officials — Jal Nigam general manager (Yamuna pollution control unit) Krishna Mohan Yadav, executive engineer Ravinder Singh, assistant engineer Praveen Kumar and junior engineer Azamat Ali — have been suspended. Principal secretary Manoj Kumar Singh said, prima facie, the workers died due to negligence towards safety measures and dereliction of duty by Jal Nigam officials and the private firm. According to locals, the four workers went inside the manhole around 1.30pm on Thursday. The supervisor went in last. Rajveer Kumar, who runs a shop about 10m away, told TOI: “First, two labourers went inside in quick succession. After that there was a loud noise. Two other labourers had been working above the ground. After they heard the sound, one of them went inside and the other rushed to inform the supervisor. Soon, both the labourer and the supervisor also went into the manhole. It all happened within five minutes.” When none of them came out after some time, Kumar raised the alarm. Local resident Vikrant Pandit said they started calling up the police around 1.40 pm. But even after 20 minutes, they could not contact the cops. “Around 2 pm, I tweeted about the incident tagging Ghaziabad police and the DM. Several others tweeted too. After about 20 minutes of the first tweet, the fire brigade reached the spot,” he said. Meanwhile, Jitendra Yadav, a labourer working nearby, volunteered and went inside the manhole to check. “People told me five workers were stuck inside the manhole. I covered my face with a wet towel and went inside to check. I found all five men unconscious. I tied one of the workers with a rope and asked one of the local residents to pull him up. The process was repeated and we managed to pull out two persons by the time the fire brigade reached the spot. It took more than 20 minutes and I came out after that because it was very difficult to breath,” Yadav said. The other three victims were pulled out by the fire brigade. Police and administrative officials said the exact cause of the deaths would be known only after the autopsy reports are out. Shlok Kumar, SP (city), told TOI that rainwater had collected inside the manhole and that had led to gas accumulating inside the chamber. Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) commissioner Dinesh Chandra said, “An inspection was carried by the GMC and Jal Nigam officials and it was found that safety gear had not been provided to the labourers.” The team found lapses on the part of contractor EMS Infracon, which has an office at Raj Nagar District Centre. The GMC also found lapses on the part of Jal Nigam executive engineer Ravinder Singh, who is supervising the project, and the assistant and junior engineers. “An FIR under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide) and relevant sections of the ST/SC Act are being registered against the private contractor and the Jal Nigam officials at Sihani gate police station on the basis of a complaint lodged by the GMC,” said Kumar. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said Samastipur district magistrate has been provided with the details of the workers and their families will be informed soon. Pandey said a magisterial probe will be conducted by the additional district magistrate (city), Shailendra Kumar Singh, and a report will be submitted within 15 days.

Lucknow,"Hum do, hamare do? But you won’t get any allowance in UP","LUCKNOW: The state government will no longer incentivise employees to have two children or less. The allowance for family planning, introduced in 1976, was withdrawn on Thursday, along with five other allowances being given to state employees. The central government had in 2017 abolished the incentive for promoting small family norms to its employees. The additional chief secretary, finance, Sanjiv Mittal, has issued an order for discontinuation of allowances to those knowing two languages or more, for operating computers, being postgraduate, handling cash, for projects (irrigation) and for family planning.

Employees were getting only Rs 20 per month to Rs 100 per month in the allowances,” he said. The doing away of family planning allowance would have the highest financial implication. “The allowance was started in 1976 during Emergency when Congress was promoting family planning. The Congress government in UP had introduced this allowance which was applicable to employees who, at the age of 40 and above, had only two children. Now most people have just two children, so this allowance makes no sense,” the official added. Similarly, the one for cash handling also became redundant as it was applicable for cashiers in offices since salaries are now credited directly into accounts, and there is hardly any need of staff for cash disbursal, he explained.

Lucknow,"UP: At 70, man fights own case against builder, wins","LUCKNOW: Soon to touch the age of 70 years, ML Sahu had never thought that the LLB degree he had earned in 1998 before joining government service would help him win a case against a real estate giant 21 years later. Three years after he plunged into a legal battle, the 69-year-old retired administrative officer of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has finally been able to recover the money he was allegedly duped into paying to the company. He also received damages for mental harassment. Sahu studied law at Guwahati University before he became an administrative officer. Settled in Lucknow, Sahu had registered a one-bedroom flat in a private housing society on Shaheed Path in 2009. He had paid Rs 13 lakh for the flat in instalments over four years. However, after giving possession of the flat to Sahu, the builder asked him to pay an extra Rs 3.7 lakh saying that the super area of the housing unit had been increased by 97 sq feet. “I paid the amount but asked the company to show documents regarding the increased area. However, the company denied, following which I filed a case in the district consumer court in 2015. I first got himself registered as a lawyer at bar council of consumer court and represented my case,” Sahu told TOI. He had hired a private agency to verify the claim by the company of increasing the super area. The agency found no area was increased. “Later, the court also got it verified through Lucknow Development Authority which came to a similar conclusion,” he said. The company, meanwhile, argued that Sahu’s petition was untenable in a consumer court because he is an investor and not a consumer. It also claimed that the transaction was fair. However, the court last April directed the company to pay Rs 5.2 lakh to Sahu. The amount included 9% interest and Rs 20,000 as compensation for harassment. “The company deposited the money in court in December 2018. It took eight more months to complete formalities. The money was finally paid to me on Tuesday,” said Sahu. Company officials did not respond to repeated calls and messages by TOI. "
Lucknow,"Yogi Adityanath rewards performers, takes laggard ministers to task","LUCKNOW: A day after chief minister Yogi Adityanath expanded his cabinet, inducting 18 new faces and promoting five ministers of state to cabinet rank, he implemented a major reshuffle of portfolios here on Thursday. The government has constituted a new Jal Shakti ministry on lines of a ministry of the same name at the Centre, indicating that projects like Clean Ganga will be a priority for it over the next two years. Mahendra Singh, who was minister of state with independent charge of rural development in the previous cabinet and was promoted to cabinet rank on Wednesday, has been handed charge of the new ministry. With the redistribution of portfolios, the chief minister has made it clear that non-performers will not be spared, especially as he now eyes the 2022 assembly elections. Ministers who might have heaved a sigh of relief after they were not made to resign before the reshuffle, have paid in other ways. Senior ministers in the cabinet were the biggest losers with several having to give up important portfolios. Sidharth Nath Singh lost the health portfolio and was given khadi gramudyog, MSME, export promotion and NRI, gaining some of the departments from Satish Mahana who is now left with just industries.

Others who were made to resign were minister Archana Pandey --whose assistant was nabbed taking a bribe -- and irrigation minister Dharampal Singh. Swati Singh, as MoS with independent charge, has lost several important portfolios like NRI, agricultural marketing and agricultural export and is left with women welfare and child development. Singh was the minister under whom the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas was organized in Varanasi earlier this year. On Wednesday, 23 ministers took oath, taking the total strength of the cabinet to 56 against a highest possible of 60 ministers. This includes 18 new ministers and five who were promoted. Sources in BJP said that ministers who have lost important portfolios should be on guard against “stricter punishment” if performance did not improve. “There are several new ministers and portfolio redistribution had to take place to accommodate everyone. However, in certain cases, it is apparent that the CM was unhappy with the department’s progress and has changed people. He is now no longer to take cold decisions as it is the 2022 election that is the driving force behind these actions,” he said. "

She said it was not enough to suspend “junior officials”— the Jal Nigam has removed four officials till further orders — but also book chief engineer GS Srivastava under culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Srivastava had on Thursday said safety equipment was not required for the five workers as the sewer line was not operational yet. “Mask and oxygen cylinders are important for chambers that are functional,” he had said.

Apart from blacklisting the private agency tasked with the job of connecting sewer lines with the chamber, Jal Nigam has suspended general manager (Yamuna pollution control unit) Krishna Mohan Yadav, executive engineer Ravinder Singh, assistant engineer Praveen Kumar and junior engineer Azamat Ali.

Lucknow,"I’m not ready to have a family any time soon and wouldn’t mind freezing my eggs, says actress Sukirti Kandpal","Dill Mill Gayye fame actress Sukirti Kandpal was visiting Lucknow after almost eight years. However, the actress revealed that she has always shared a special connect with one of her favourite cities Lucknow. “I share a really special bond with Lucknow. Last, I was here for the promotions of Pyaar Kii Ye Ek Kahaani. I remember that I went out with the Lucknow Times team for a chaat outing where we ate the famous basket chaat in Hazratganj. I was here with the whole cast and crew of the serial and that trip was so much fun,” she shared Interestingly, Sukirti’s father too shares a very strong Lucknow connect as he has studied in Lucknow and she too was a frequent visitor in her childhood. “Before coming to Lucknow, I called my father up and told him that I am going to Lucknow. And he got so nostalgic and started telling me about his Lucknow University days and all the fun he had while staying at the boys hostel here. In fact, my dad is a part of the Lucknow University's alumni association too and keeps coming here frequently for the meets,” says she adding, “As a child, I used to be a regular to Lucknow. I have pictures from being a kid to growing up clicked at the Bada and Chhota Imambara, Lucknow Zoo, etc. I have roamed around in different markets of Lucknow with my mom and dad and have pictures of those visits too. But the most fond memories are from the Lucknow Zoo where once my mom was feeding an alligator but I ran away from the place as I was dead scared. Now, although, I am dead against the concept of animals in captivity.” Talking about the show Pyaar Kii Ek Kahaani, which was a vampire story, and a concept new for the TV audience, Sukirti says had the show been on air today, it would have been a massive hit. “Our Indian television audience follows a certain pattern. When our supernatural show was launched, they wanted very natural shows. But now is the time for just supernatural shows. However, folklore concepts have always been loved by our audience but ab woh concept super hit hai small screen pe and our audience is just glued to supernatural shows,” says she. But Indian supernatural shows are made fun of with several memes trending online and lack good script writing. Commenting on that Sukirti says, “More than the script of these shows, it is the special effects that is made fun of. The special effects are really expensive and not all makers can afford it. Our supernatural shows lack technology and not content,” says she.

And yes, I have heard about the makkhi series of Sasural Simar Ka which trended online,” she chuckles. Sukirti, who was in the city to promote her episodic track on Savdhaan India, is not seen much on TV these days. Ask her the reason and she says, “In the past I have been offered a lot of mythological shows, but they all required me to relocate for several months, which as of now I am not okay with. So that’s why I am unable to do such shows on TV. Plus I was offered a super natural show too, which I turned down. I have become a little choosy. I have been working since I was 19 and now I want to take it slow. Recently, I have bought this beautiful house which I was busy doing up. I also went to Nainital for family reunions. So I’m enjoying some really good family time.” Ask her about plans of getting married and she says, “My family members don’t force me at all to get married. I am happily settled without being married. And believe you me, this is the best time for women to do exactly what they want to do. This is the best time to be a woman and be a complete rebel and people are just going to accept it. Also, for women now, marriage is not something they have to rush into to start a family. I don’t think there is a concept of the biological clock ticking now as there are so many medical advancements today. One can easily get her eggs freezed. I am not ready to have a family any time soon and wouldn’t mind freezing my eggs. A lot of my friends have gotten that done.” "
Kanpur,83 LCAs Order: HAL may finally agree to lower price,"BENGALURU: Staring at a depleting order book, defence PUS Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) — negotiating price for the 83 Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas aircraft order — is likely to agree to a price that is significantly lower than its quotation. According to sources privy to the negotiations, HAL quoted Rs 450 crore per aircraft as the basic price. “MoD and IAF (customers) are firm that this price is not competitive and are negotiating for a price that is less than Rs 300 crore per aircraft. Negotiations are nearly complete and final price is likely to be in the range of Rs 250 crore and Rs 275 crore,” a source said.If the price is Rs 275 crore, then the value of 83 LCAs would be about Rs 22,825 crore compared to Rs 37,350 crore if it was Rs 450 crore. This value would be excluding maintenance and other aspects of the overall deal. It’s noteworthy that former defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman had pegged the total value of LCA order at Rs 50,000 crore in January.“HAL really has no choice. If we need to sustain our production lines and the employees, we need fresh orders, and this is one of the bigger orders which will go on for at least five years,” a source said.

According to MoD, HAL has orders for 48 fixed wing aircraft—only 12 of these for Nasik plant—67 helicopters, 80 engines and 26 sets of rocket structures placed by Isro (See graphic). One source claimed: “The Gripen, which has features similar to LCA, was costing less than Rs 300 crore per plane and that HAL must become competitive and be able to offer similar price.” Gripen is manufactured by Swedish firm SAAB.Another source said that this would benefit HAL in the long run to increase efficiency to reduce costs. Eventually, the aim is to export LCAs and HAL has already expressed an interest in supplying them to Malaysia. If it wants to export, it needs to price aircraft in the same range as others. “Why would anybody pay Rs 450 crore for Tejas if they can buy Gripens for cheaper,” the source argued, adding: “Also, HAL quoted 2.5 lakh man hours to build one aircraft and the customers want it to be 1.5 lakh hours,” a source said.HAL Order Book: Top Commentyou pay peanuts, you get peanuts (across globe) in india we always get peanut , even if we pay more. so why pay more.indianSee All CommentsAdd commentProjectHAL DivisionOrder Book Position#LCA TejasBangalore24Su-30MKINasik12Donier-228Kanpur12ALH (helicopter)Bangalore56Chetak (helicopter)Bangalore08Cheetal (helicopter)Bangalore03Engine RD-33Koraput19Engine AL-31 FPKoraput61PSLV StructureAerospace Div Bangalore24 setsGSLV StructureAerospace Div Bangalore02 setsSource: Ministry of Defence "

Lucknow,"UP government fails to pay fee, school expels six RTE students","LUCKNOW: A private school in Lalbagh expelled six students admitted under the Right to Education (RTE) Act after the education department allegedly failed to submit their fees of last two sessions. Taking a cue from the development, several other institutions have also warned such students that their admissions would be cancelled if their fee was not received on time. Under the RTE Act, children from economically weaker sections get a chance to study in reputed schools and the basic education department pays Rs 450 per student per month for their education. However, often there is a delay in payment of fees which results in a piquant situation for students.

Parents of the affected students have lodged a written complaint with the education department following which a show-cause notice has been issued to the school directing it to admit the students again with immediate effect. However, the school has not complied with the orders yet. A parent, on condition of anonymity, said: “Our children are being punished for tussle between the education department and schools.” President of Unaided Private Schools Association (UPSA) Anil Agarwal said, “The government does not pay the fees of students admitted under RTE in private schools and warns us that our affiliation will be cancelled if we don’t admit students. We have to meet the salary expenditure of teachers and school employees. If we are bound to follow the RTE Act, the government also needs to pay fees promised to us.” Basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) Amar Kant Singh said, “Under the RTE Act, private schools are bound to admit students. They cannot deny them admission or cancel it. Schools which don’t follow the RTE Act are going against the law.” “The education department has issued a show-cause notice to the school. Strict action will be taken against them if they fail to furnish a satisfactory reply and do not follow the rules,” he added. "

The uncle, Satish Chandra (63), was trying to stop his nephew from beating his wife and son when the incident happened. According to the police, Dinesh Diwakar is addicted to alcohol and often thrashed his wife in an inebriated state. Chandra, who retired from the Indian Railways, resided near Dinesh’s house. Chandra’s son, Ashwani Diwakar, told TOI that like all other days Chandra had gone for a walk after dinner on Friday. “Around 10pm, when my father returned, neighbours informed him that Dinesh was beating his wife and 8-year-old son,” Diwakar said. When Chandra entered Dinesh’s house, the latter was beating his wife with his belt and slipper. He had allegedly asked her to give him money to buy liquor, which she refused. “As my father could not stop Dinesh, he slapped him. Dinesh went inside his room, only to come out within seconds with a pistol. Before anyone could react, he shot my father,” Diwakar said.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Jal Nigam’s executive engineer booked for sewer deaths,"GHAZIABAD: Police on Saturday booked an executive engineer of Jal Nigam on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder for the deaths of five sewer workers in Nandgram in Ghaziabad. Moreover, all FIRs and complaints have also been merged into one case, being investigated by a circle officer, officials said. “The name of Jal Nigam’s executive engineer Ravinder Singh has been added as an accused in the merged FIR filed under Section 304 of the IPC and under SC/ST Act and Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act,” SP (city) Shlok Kumar said. “Singh’s name was added in the FIR on the basis of a complaint filed by the GMC. However, he has not been arrested,” said another police official. The five — four labourers, identified as Damodar (40), Horil (35), Sanjeet (30), and Shiv Kumar (32), and their supervisor Vijay Kumar (40) — died after they had descended into a 14-foot-deep manhole to connect it with the under-construction sewer line in Nandgram’s Krishna Kunj colony on Thursday afternoon. A subsequent inspection by GMC and Jal Nigam officials found that safety gear were not provided to the labourers working at the site, which had led to the accident. The team found lapses on the part of contractor EMS Infracon, apart from Jal Nigam’s Singh, who was supervising the project, and the assistant and junior engineers. GDA vice-chairman Kanchan Verma reiterated on Saturday that “manual scavenging is not allowed while cleaning sewers”, and directed the department officials to ensure that “the rule is being implemented strictly”. The FIR against the senior Jal Nigam official also comes a day after the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis sought an FIR against the chief engineer of Jal Nigam, saying he, too, should be held accountable for the deaths of five workers, all of them from Samastipur district in Bihar. “The district head of the department should be held responsible for any accident due to negligence and not some junior officials,” Manju Diler, a member of the commission, had said, after visiting the spot on Friday. Meanwhile, the families of three of the five workers — Sanjeet, Damodar and Horil — said they were not satisfied with the cheque of Rs 10 lakh handed over to them on Saturday as compensation and demanded that jobs be given to at least one member of each family. Suresh, Sanjeet’s father, said, “The compensation is not enough and a job should be given to his wife. How she is going to take care of her one-year-old son? We do not have any land and working as daily-wagers is the only source of our income.” Damodar’s elder brother Deen Dayal added, “Damodar was the sole earner for his family, comprising his wife and four daughters, aged 14, 11, 5 and 3 years. He had not been able to send money home from Ghaziabad for the past six months as the company was not paying him. The compensation is not enough for his family.” Over the past few months, several people have died in Delhi-NCR after getting trapped in sewer holes. The cases have seen little progress, except for suspension of officials and compensation to the families of the deceased. "

Lucknow,Signature riddle in Lucknow University marksheet scam,"LUCKNOW: Two fake Lucknow University (LU) degrees recovered from the busted marksheet gang seem to bear original signatures of varsity officials, a finding that has prompted police to queue the documents, dating back to 2005-06, for immediate forensic examination. The gang, comprising serving and former LU employees, was busted in April along with two degrees, 14 marksheets and two tabulation charts of LU, besides documents belonging to other institutions in the state and outside. “The two degrees, issued in 2005 and 2006, were verified as fake because their serial numbers did not match with the LU records. We contacted the clerk who wrote those two degrees. He confirmed his handwriting and said the degrees were signed by the then controllers of examination,” said LU outpost in-charge Abhay Kumar Singh. On the request of police, LU had earlier submitted names, phone numbers and addresses of all employees and officials who worked in the examination department since 1999. “We have now taken sample signatures of all the controllers of examination who have served since 1999. These are being sent for forensic tests along with the fake degrees,” Singh said.

Lucknow,Lucknow civic body loosens purse strings for ward development,"LUCKNOW: Citizens can hope for better civic services because Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) has decided to release Rs 22 crore, the first instalment of corporator area development fund, on August 26. On July 6, TOI had highlighted how delay in releasing the money had hit development work. According to LMC officials, all the 110 corporators will get the first instalment of Rs 20 lakh each on Monday. The total amount of Rs 95 lakh each will be given in three parts. Every corporator will receive the second instalment of Rs 45 lakh in October this year and the final disbursement will be made in February 2020. A section of corporators argued that release of funds in monsoon made no sense. “Development work in my ward is pending for months. Even if I get the money now, I cannot facilitate road revamp. Construction work will have to wait till after the rains,” said Nagendra Singh, corporator of Hazratganj.

Lucknow,Lucknow development authority identifies twin plots for two new power substations,"LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) has identified two plots in Vishal Khand that will be handed over to Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (MVVNL) for setting up substations to either provide or boost electricity supply to Gomtinagar and Gomtinagar extension. On August 13, TOI had reported that MVVNL had decided not to give power connections to upcoming housing units and flats in the two areas because the LDA had not provided land for two new substations. The areas suffer frequent power cuts because of overloading faced by the four existing substations. According to LDA officials, they have now identified two 350sqm plots and are in talks with MVVNL for final handover. The development authority also plans to build around 400 luxury flats, each unit costing Rs 80 lakh, in Vibhuti Khand and Vikalp Khand areas of Gomtinagar. These flats will boast imported tile or marble flooring and come fully furnished. LDA vice-chairman PN Singh said, “The land will be handed over to the power corporation for substations soon. For the high-end flats, we have hired three architects. They will draw up the blueprint after which construction work will begin.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy."
Ghaziabad,"In Ghaziabad, these cycling tracks have space for everything but cyclists","NOIDA: Cycling tracks, one of the flagship projects of the previous government under Akhilesh Yadav, are lying in a shambles in Raj Nagar Extension. They have either been broken down at places, encroached upon by vendors or being used for parking of vehicles. The situation is worse in front of markets in the township. Residents said the tracks are being used for all sorts of purposes except for cycling. A survey of the area revealed that the space meant for cyclists in front of a market near Aura Chimera society has completely been encroached upon by shops and vehicles. As an extension of their shops located in the market, eateries have put up stalls inside the barricaded area. The situation is no different on the road where societies such as KW Shristi, Fortune Residency and VVIP Addresses are located. Here, several makeshift furniture, vehicle repair shops and food joints have come up on vacant plots. A section of residents demands that these cycle tracks should be removed for their failure to serve the purpose. Gajendra Arya, president of the Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association of Raj Nagar Extension, said, “They are useless. We have raised the issue with the authorities and demanded that they be demolished and the road be widened. As a large chunk of the road is barricaded on both sides for the tracks, they serve as safe haven for encroachers.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Residents said that in the absence of proper monitoring, encroachers do not pay much heed and start setting up shops on roadsides within a few days of being removed. GDA secretary Santosh Kumar Rai said there was no plan to remove tracks from the area. “The Authority will not demolish them. People should use them for cycling. We have carried out anti-encroachment drives in the past, but it has been noticed that violators return to the same place after a few days. An instruction will be given to officials to remove encroachments once again,” he said.

Investigations are underway to ascertain from where he got the Army uniform and what was his motive. The police identified the youth as Brijendra Kumar Yadav, a native of Jahanpur village in Rae Bareli district. CO, Cantt, Ravi Kumar said a group of Air Force officials on Friday evening gave him a lift while he was standing near the Air Force station in Chakeri area. “The Air Force officials said when they inquired from him about his rank and regiment, he drew blank and couldn’t reply to their queries even though he wore an Army uniform, which fuelled their suspicion and they handed him to local police. He was identified as Brijendra Kumar Yadav, a native of Jahanpur village in Rae Bareli district,” said CO further. CO further said Brijendra later broke down during questioning and confessed that he wore Army uniform only as he had lied with his family regarding his job in Army.

Kanpur,Ragging case: Saifai medical varsity suspends 7 students,"KANPUR: After remaining in denial for four days and defending an alleged incident of ragging as a “sanskar” and “manners-building” exercise, the Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences, Saifai, made a U-turn on Friday and suspended seven students of the 2018 MBBS batch for three months. While a penalty of Rs 25,000 has been slapped on each of the seven, the university will also levy a fine of Rs 5,000 each from all the 150 students of the 2018 batch. In parallel measures, the varsity has removed dean of students welfare Kalbe Jawwad, suspended hostel wardens Ganesh Kumar and Gyasuddin Haider and sacked security personnel who were on duty during the incident on Tuesday. The existing anti-ragging committee and the anti-ragging flying squad have been dissolved as well.

Action against the senior students was taken on the basis of a report submitted by a 12-member anti-ragging committee of the university, which further recommended forming of a new anti-ragging panel and flying squad. “We have suspended seven students of the 2018 MBBS batch for three months.

Lucknow,I request the filmmakers to not use CBFC for your marketing or your promotions: Prasoon Joshi in Lucknow,"Itishree.Misra@timesgroup.com Writer, lyricist, poet and also the Chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification, Prasoon Joshi wears all his hats well and with precision. Known to voice his thoughts freely and openly, Joshi doesn’t shy from calling a spade for what it is. In Lucknow recently to participate in a government event, the writer of several films including Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and the more recent Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, talks about what more the UP government needs to do to boost film shootings in the state and also expresses his views on the letters written against the central government. Q: You have been working in close association with the state government. You have helped them with their tourism campaign and and also written the song for the Ardh Kumbh Mela 2019. What do you feel about the state’s present film policy, especially considering that UP has lost out on the National Award two years in a row now for being the Most Film Friendly State.Ans: The Uttar Pradesh government has taken a lot of initiatives for promoting film shooting in terms of using UP as a shooting destination and making it easier for people to work here. And I think it’s just an exercise to check how far they’ve come in that and how it can be made better. I thought I should be here to discuss what further can be done. Already I find that a lot of people are coming here to shoot their films. I hear they are finding the facilities, the single-window system of clearances and permissions and also the officials very approachable and easy to work with, which is a very positive sign. Apart from this, I think it’s very important for the government to do a dipstick or a check with people who have shot here to know what is lacking, what they need to work upon and how to improve things. Also what they found good and what they didn’t find good. Because they are practical problems and their solution is very simple which I am sure the officials can work out easily. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.What more can be done to improve upon it, in your suggestion. See overall, I think it’s a great effort. All I would like to add is that in Mumbai I meet a lot of youngsters who come from UP to become actors, writers, directors, lyricists, musicians and they don’t know where to get guidance for that. So I think we can find more career opportunities for them related to films and guide the youth of the state. I think if we can create windows for them of that kind, that initiative, I think I’m going to propose to the government if they can find some way to do that. The youth of this state is very talented. And I feel very-very sad when they lose out on that very precious time during their initial years of life which should be utilized for training or honing their talent rather than running from pillar to post looking or asking for work and trying to find a footing. So, if one can provide that kind of guidance, it would be great. I haven’t really found a solution which I can suggest, but maybe it can be done through universities, educational institutions, seminars, symposiums or maybe have permanent guides, have portals today for the youth to train online. Willy-nilly, if it is possible to give the youth of Uttar Pradesh more guidance and assistance, then we in Bollywood can collaborate and provide them that guidance and training. Also one very important thing, I think we need to sensitize people, both the filmmakers and also the people of the place where the filmmakers are shooting, to respect each other’s boundaries. The director, actors, unit hands, crew, everyone should be very sensitive towards the people around them and the place they are shooting in because you’re not there to disturb their lives. You have to respectfully deal with the common man. And in turn the people also need to be told to respect the filmmakers and their cast and crew. They should be made aware that these people are all doing their jobs. They are not there to disturb your life. They will do their job and move away so be a little patient and bear with them. So it’s like a two-way street – each one giving way to the other. Prasoon Joshi (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)  Prasoon Joshi (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Q:Talking of films, in recent times we’ve seen content-driven films like Badhaai Ho, Andhadhun, Uri: The Surgical Strike and Raazi doing very well at the Box-Office as opposed to films which had big stars in it. So would you say that the story of the film is its hero now?Ans: Yes, in a way. See we are dealing with a satiated generation of people. We are satiated with entertainment. There’s so much of entertainment available vis-à-vis what we had before. So gone are the days when we used to wait for Friday and used to think which film will release this week and woh chahe job hi ho, dekhni hi hai. So that was the deprived generation, itna TV nahi tha, web toh tha hi nahi. Now when people are going to watch a film they have made a very informed decision to watch that film. Now, when you make an informed decision, it’s very different. You read about it, research on it, talk about it and then make up your mind whether you would like to watch that particular film or not. So your expectations are very different. So just watching your favourite stars doing whatever on screen is not what you’re there for. Also gone are the days when you could not see your favourite star. Your favourite star is now in your hands! He or she is there on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or online, he’s also on TV. So you’re no longer being deprived of seeing your favourite star. Your hero or heroine is now right in front of your eyes 24X7. There was a time when you looked up in awe at your hero or the heroine on the big screen, now you look down at them on a smaller screen! That’s also the different, the gaze has changed from looking up to looking down! Now the star looks more approachable, more tactile, more touch and feel, so they appear less god-like now. They are freely discussing their problems with you on Twitter and Facebook and through blogs, so that aura of stars is also less now. That whole relationship of the stars and their fans and people is also getting redefined. Hence the deprivation is not there. So today, if your film doesn’t promise good content, it’s unlikely that people will go and watch it. So there has to be something in the film to entice people to watch it. Q: So is the age of stars over in Bollywood vis-à-vis actors?Ans: Stars can never be over, but the definition of stars is no longer the same. That god-like, larger-than-life persona is no longer there. That is definitely getting redefined. There will always be stars. People will talk about a particular person and say I love the way he or she talks or looks or acts. There will always be people’s favourites among actors and they will be the stars but that awe and that sense of worship that people used to feel, that has definitely changed. It’s now a more multidimensional relationship that people have with a star today. They also want to know how my star lives, eats, how witty they are or not, is he intelligent or not, in everyday life what he or she does and their personal relationships. So it’s no more a relationship of a star and a fan, it’s more like that of a friend. Prasoon Joshi (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)  Prasoon Joshi (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Q: You have taken a very strong stand against the open letter written by 49 filmmakers, activists and artists against mob lynchings to the government. You along with 61 others have said that they ‘expressed selective concern and demonstrated a clear political bias and motive’. Would you want say more on the topic?Ans: I feel human life is very important. There’s no debate on that. If somebody says that human life is getting compromised somewhere, of course one will oppose that. You have to oppose that and bring it to the notice of the authorities. You just can’t let it go on and under the name of any disguise or garb you can’t justify it. But if the topic would have been that only, I would have said nothing. But unfortunately that’s not the case. The case is in the garb of this pretense of human life. The people who are bringing this to your notice, haven’t done this for the first time, they have been doing it again and again. I question the intent of it. I feel there is a definite dislike. Just the fact that I don’t like the government and I have to pick and choose and selectively portray a certain picture, because I don’t like them. I feel this is condescending and unfair. You look at any policy of the current government, they are not biased towards anybody or any exception of the society. They’re being absolutely neutral. If you feel something is not right, then there’s two ways of looking at it. One is that ‘Oh! There’s something not right and we need to constructively look at this and solve this problem’. Second is you’re portraying a dark picture and you’re making people feel as if nothing is going right in this country and it’s doomed. And that is depressing. That is misleading people; that is not constructive. That is because your approach is to malign the goverment and say that these people do not know governance. And that’s because you don’t agree with them, you don’t like them. So if that is the reason of your criticism then I don’t find it genuine. All I’m saying is that! Q: CBFC has become most non-controversial these days, so much so that it’s no longer in news!Ans: That’s because I’m totally fair. No one can say that I am above board. The doors are open of the CBFC. Mein vivaad ki jagah vichaar-vimarsh mein yaqeen rakhta hoon. Mujhe lagta hai through discussion, through dialogue, you can always put forth your point. See understand, what is the role of the CBFC? It is a set of representation of people. Who is there in the committee of CBFC? Housewives, school teachers, engineers, advocates, these are the kind of normal people who sit in the committee and they sit and watch a film to see how will this film impact the people. That is what the job of the CBFC is. Now, filmmakers sometimes get agitated and say that they don’t understand the film. Of course, they don’t understand the film! They are there to bring to you the point of view of the common people. So I said, please sit together and look into the eyes of each other where the filmmaker tells his or her point of view and you tell the point of view of the common person. There definitely would be a common meeting ground for them both, if you honestly talk. So I have only tried to bring a lot of transparency and dialogues through which you see, a lot of things have been solved. Take for instance Article 15, it deals with a sensitive subject, but still it released. Also Padmaavat, there was so much of confusion but in the end it released, also the film on our Prime Minister. I don’t know why there used to be so much of controversy? Also because I request the filmmakers to not use CBFC for your marketing or your promotions to create unnecessary controversies. Because I would not be able to give any quotes for your promotions. — Itishree.Misra@timesgroup.com "

In a letter to the district administration, Jaitley, who represented UP in the Upper House of Parliament, had proposed to install 200 solar-powered high-mast lights in Rae Bareli with a grant from his MP's Local Area Development (MPLAD) fund.

""It was like his last wish was to light up Rae Bareli before Diwali. The project will be executed in coordination with the District Rural Development Agency. We will expedite the project,"" said District magistrate Neha Sharma. When Jaitley had announced his intention to spend his MPLAD funds on schemes in Rae Bareli in October, it was seen as a move to breach Congress's bastion ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. ""The backwardness of the district is what prompted Jaitley ji to choose Rae Bareli,"" Bajpai said.

It actually takes off from Georgian architecture (styles in English-speaking countries between 1714 and 1830). It is quite a marvel, having weathered over 215 summers,"" said the 20-year-old geology student of Lucknow University. Som was among the 30-odd history enthusiasts who spent an hour on Sunday morning visiting two city landmarks - Dilkusha Kothi and Bibiyapur Kothi - and hear about forgotten tales from experts. The heritage walk was organised by Citizens for Lucknow, a group of like-minded people who are doing their bit to save historic monuments. It began at 7am from Dilkusha Garden gate and ended at the arched doorways of Kothi Bibiyapur, a few miles away.

""Despite being built under Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth nawab of Oudh, the European influence is so pronounced. It had to be given that the nawab entertained his European guests inside these commodious halls,"" she added. Historian Taqui said exploring the monuments of Lucknow could be enlightening. ""This is not an ancient city and yet many of its historical events are misconstrued. For instance, many think it was Henry Lawrence, the British military officer of East India Company, who died during the shelling at Dilkusha Kothi. But, it was actually Henry Havelock, a British general, who died during the siege here on November 24, 1857, and was later buried at Alambagh Kothi,"" the expert said. Taqui added, ""History cannot be changed and people should know the truth about the past. That is our primary objective."" "

Kanpur,Hamirpur bypoll on September 23 after Chandel's conviction,"LUCKNOW: The Election Commission on Sunday announced byelection to Hamirpur assembly seat on September 23. The assembly seat fell vacant following the disqualification of BJP MLA Ashok Chandel, who has been convicted in a 22-year-old murder case.

The commission will issue a notification for Hamirpur seat on August 28, while the last date for filing nomination is September 4. Result would be declared on September 27. Hamirpur is the first of the total 12 assembly seats where byelections are due. However, dates for the rest 11 are yet to be announced by the poll panel. Bypolls to 11 other seats have been necessitated following election of sitting legislators to the Lok Sabha this year. Eleven seats where byelections are due include Rampur, Jalalpur, Balha, Kanpur, Jaidpur, Lucknow Cantt, Gangoh, Tundla, Banda, Iglas and Pratapgarh.

Kanpur,Water released from dams ups level at Ganga barrage,"KANPUR: Besides increasing water level at Ganga barrage, the regular discharge of water from the barrage into the river's downstream has caused a flood-like situation in the low-lying areas in Allahabad. As per the data made available by the irrigation department, in the last three days (since August 23), over 7.61 lakh cusecs of water was discharged from the Ganga barrage which headed towards Allahabad and Varanasi. Of 7.61 lakh cusecs water, over 2.79 lakh cusecs, which was the highest discharge in a single day this year, was released on Saturday.

At present, the discharge quantity has gone up to 2.79 lakh cusecs in a single day, the data said. The increase in discharge of such a large quantity of water is due to the barrage receiving regular water supply from Haridwar and Narora dams. In the last three days, over 3.12 lakh cusecs of water was discharged from the Narora dam into the Ganga's downstream. In the last three days, 2.13 cusecs of water was released from Haridwar.

Lucknow,"UP: Cops pinned down, beaten in Aliganj","LUCKNOW: Three policemen at the busy Kapoorthala crossing were thrashed late Sunday when they tried to stop a group of five from assaulting a man in public. A petty dispute triggered the fight, which turned ugly and even men in khaki were not spared. Sub-inspector Rajesh Kumar and constables, Sanjay Yadav and Mahesh Kanaujia, of Aliganj police station rushed to the Aliganj intersection after receiving an SOS that five men on the rampage were assaulting a man. When cops tried to stop the miscreants, a war of words ensued and then they were pinned down by the goons and thrashed. One of the cops swiftly called for back-up which arrived within minutes and the miscreants were overpowered and taken into custody. One of the arrested, Vaibhav Singh, is a relative of a police inspector and lives with him at Reserve Police Lines, Mahanagar. Other accused were Prakhar Gupta, Ashok Singh, Manoj Yadav and Arvind Kumar. Two separate FIRs were lodged — one by the assault victim, Dharmendra Pushkar, and the other by three cops who were thrashed by the miscreants. The accused were booked for rioting, assault, preventing public servant from discharging duty, attempt to robbery, damaging public property and breach of peace. Pushkar alleged he witnessed accused Vaibhav and Ashok beating a man after their bike hit his scooter.

Lucknow,Will City of Nawabs turn into ticking stink bomb?,"LUCKNOW: The executive committee of Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) on Monday slashed its 2019-20 budget for sanitation and cleanliness by Rs 20 crore on the ground that it had adequate resources to keep the city tidy even though TOI reality check in the past year exposed unattended garbage and clogged drains on several occasions. The committee, headed by the mayor, has reduced the budget for cleaning drains by Rs 2.50 crore (15%) from Rs 10 crore and sanitation by Rs 4.50 crore (4.5%) from Rs 100 crore. The money allocated for employing contractual sanitation workers has also been cut back by Rs 15 crore (20%) from Rs 75 crore. This means fewer hands for cleaning drains and collecting garbage from both doorstep and roadside. The cuts have been made despite it being common knowledge that choked drains is the main reason behind waterlogging this monsoon. Piling garbage, on the other hand, was among the major factors behind low rank (121 among 421 cities in India) in the Swachh Survekshan this year.

In addition, the high court pulled up the LMC for poor garbage management, among other things. Citizens are no wonder annoyed with the decision to slash budget. Taruna Sharma of Rajajipuram said, “There is no dustbin in our locality. The door-to-door garbage collection is very poor too. All the LMC does is make hollow promises. The city is far from clean.” Residents of prominent areas like Gomtinagar, Jankipuram, Aliganj, Mahanagar, Alambagh and Aashiana pointed out that waterlogging, even if it rained for half an hour, underscored that city drains were choking on garbage. Currently, the LMC has 10,000 sanitation workers, 6,000 of them permanent and the rest contractual. The reduced budget will affect employment opportunities for the 4,000-strong temporary workforce even if a decision on retrenchment is yet to be taken.

Lucknow,BSP leader from Ballia &amp; Nishad neta in SP camp,"LUCKNOW: Having lost three prominent leaders in Rajya Sabha to BJP, a depleted Samajwadi Party drew some solace when it weaned away an influential leader, Ghoora Ram, from Mayawati’s camp on Monday. A former minister in the BSP government, Ram holds sway over Dalits in Ballia. After joining Samajwadi Party, he told reporters he wants to see Akhilesh Yadav as chief minister in 2022. Ram said, several BSP leaders, including former ministers, MLAs and grassroots cadre were feeling stifled and were ready to join Samajwadi Party. Another backward leader and president of Phoolan Sena, Gopal Nishad, too joined Samajwadi Party on Monday. After a long spell of bad news, there was some cheer for Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, who hinted at reorganising his party machinery for 2022 assembly elections. On Monday, he dissolved the party’s Delhi unit, days after disbanding the state and district units in Uttar Pradesh. Despite being attacked by Mayawati, Akhilesh has refused to be drawn into a war of words.

Lucknow,"Now, BJP to churn grassroots units before bypolls","LUCKNOW: After the cabinet rejig, the ruling BJP is set to churn its organisational machinery in Uttar Pradesh. On Monday, the party kicked off the exercise to select fresh foot soldiers in the run-up to bypolls in 12 assembly seats. This means the refurbished saffron brigade will also steer the party’s political fortunes in 2022 assembly polls as the schedule for the next organizational reshuffle, which happens every three years, will be past the deadline. BJP sources said, 30-40% district units would be disbanded and reorganized and new district presidents and other functionaries would be elected. The move comes close on heels of BJP executing a membership drive in which 50 lakh new members were inducted. “BJP is run democratically and new functionaries are elected every three years,” UP BJP state general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak told TOI. He said an organisational reshuffle was due in 2018, but was delayed as the party was gearing up for Lok Sabha elections. A senior BJP leader said the party decided on micro-management at booth-and-sector levels to reach out to maximum voters. In the process, divisions were proposed to be raised from 1400 to 1900 and a sector-level unit would comprise six booths, instead of 12. “A new band of party functionaries will give a new lease of life to the organisation,” said UP BJP spokesperson, Rakesh Tripathi. He said the grassroots organisational reshuffle would eventually give a new shape to the party to take on the Opposition. Subsequently, the state-level leadership would be decided. This comes amidst the party identifying active members, who managed to get at least 50 new people in the party fold. Sources said, BJP plans to lay special focus on 30,000 booths, where it could not get a single vote in recent Lok Sabha elections. These are booths which are essentially dominated by Dalits and Muslims and a caste realignment would be done to suit its electoral fortunes.

Ghaziabad,"Tourism department wants Rs 2 crore for Hindon Motel, GDA refuses","GHAZIABAD: The UP tourism department has sought Rs 1.91 crore from the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) for the building it raised at the Hindon Motel site. The 24,000sqm plot at Hindon Motel belongs to the GDA and had been given to the state tourism department on lease in 1980.

GDA, turning down the tourism department’s demand, said there is no question of its paying a single penny to the latter. “GDA had leased the land for a period of 30 years, which lapsed in 2011,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner, GDA. “Even though the lease lapsed, GDA did not claim the land and the tourism department was allowed to operate for a good nine years without paying a single penny,” Shivpuri added.

Lucknow,SC: Does mosque demolition impact claims on land?,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked a discomfiting question to both Hindu and Muslim parties - whether demolition of the suit property, the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid structure, in 1992 adversely impacted cross-claims for ownership of the 2.77 acre disputed land.  When a Hindu party was presenting evidence to back its claim that Mughal emperor Babur did not pull down a temple to construct the mosque at the disputed site, a bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer asked what the impact of demolition of the mosque in 1992 would be on the cross-suits claiming ownership.  ""In 1992, the disputed structure was pulled down. What is its consequence and effect on the declaratory suits? If the subject matter of a declaratory suit (the disputed structure) is destroyed, can the suits be still maintained?"" asked Justice Bobde. The question went unanswered by both sides.  The first suit was filed by worshipper Gopal Singh Visharad in 1950, immediately after idols were allegedly placed under the central dome of the disputed structure on the night of December 22, 1949, seeking right to worship and non-removal of idols from inside the mosque.

Worship of these idols by Hindus also continued without interruption since 1949 and the structure was not used by Muslims for offering prayers since then. The controversy remained at a low ebb till 1986 when the district court of Faizabad ordered reopening of the lock placed on a grill leading to the sanctum sanctorum of the shrine.""

Ghaziabad,"Unhappy with tantrik, woman kidnaps kid","GHAZIABAD: A 35-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping the two-and-a-half-year-old daughter of a tantrik after the treatment recommended by him did not yield the desired results. Police said the woman contacted Surender for treatment two years ago and gave him about Rs 2 lakh for this purpose. But when she found his treatment unsatisfactory, she abducted his daughter Vinshika as revenge and took her to Chhattisgarh, they added. Police said they took the woman’s phone number from the family and put her under surveillance. It took two days to trace her, after which a police team was sent to the state to rescue the kidnapped child. However, during a press conference by police, the woman told TOI that Surender and one of his friends had raped her several times on the pretext of treatment. “This is the only reason behind the revenge,” she said.

Shlok Kumar, SP (city), Ghaziabad, told TOI that on August 22, the woman went to Surender’s house in Indirapuram. The tantrik was not home and his wife was working inside. “Vinshika was playing with some children outside the house and taking advantage of this, the woman took her to Chhattisgarh,” he added. “During questioning, the woman said that she was not happy with Surender’s treatment and had asked him several times to return her money. She also said that he had promised to return it if he couldn’t resolve her problem,” Kumar said. "
Ghaziabad,Child-lifting rumours fuel mob frenzy in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: Two strangers standing next to each other on a road in Ghaziabad’s Tronica City were suddenly attacked by a mob on Wednesday morning because they “looked like child-lifters”. The previous day, a 58-year-old woman walking with her four-year-old grandson on a road in Loni was thrashed by a group that thought she had kidnapped the child, their suspicion aroused by the “difference in the woman’s and the kid’s complexions”. The woman might have been killed by the mob had a police team not intervened and rescued her. Rumours and fake videos of children being kidnapped are generating paranoia about traffickers lurking around neighbourhoods, leading to a spate of attacks like these over the past week, especially in rural areas of the district. The police, worried that this could spread fast, issued an advisory on Wednesday warning people against indulging in violence. They have started going around villages and making announcements on public address systems, saying they will identify those involve in violence through CCTV footage and social media videos. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Since August 23, four FIRs have been registered in connection with cases where people were beaten up over rumours of child-lifting in Ghaziabad. Cases are yet to be filed in two more cases. The triggers for the attacks ranged from perceived suspicious behaviour to skin tone. The woman beaten up in Loni was thought to be a kidnapper because the mob believed her grandson, who has a lighter complexion, could not be related to her. “They were saying the child was fair while the woman was dark-complexioned. We reached the spot in time and rescued her from the mob,” a police officer said on Wednesday. Seven people have been arrested under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said: “Most of these cases have been reported in rural areas. We have come out with an advisory that if anyone finds any suspicious moment, s/he should inform the police instead of taking the law in their own hands.” Police are also keeping a close watch on social media. “People often make fake videos and circulate them on WhatsApp or Facebook. The result is an impression that child-lifting gangs are active in the area. We have now increased patrolling and formed a team to avert such incidents. We are also maintaining a strict vigil on social media to check rumour-mongering,” Kumar said. Police said they have started talking to village pradhans and telling them there is no child-lifting gang active in the district. No complaint has been lodged so far. A series of lynchings over rumours of child-lifting had rocked the country in 2017-18. It started in May 2017, when a group of three cattle traders were lynched in Jharkhand’s Ranjanagar on suspicion of being child lifters. In Assam’s Karbi Anglong, a mob of nearly 250 people had in June 2018 attacked Nilotpal Das (29) and Abhijit Nath (30) following fake news spread through WhatsApp messages that they had kidnapped two children from a nearby village.

Lucknow,Dengue fever stalks Lucknow as joint drive loses sting,"LUCKNOW: A fresh case of dengue fever has taken the patient count in the city to 14 since the onset of monsoon, but alleged lack of co-ordination between LMC and the health department is only triggering a rise in the sting menace. A 22-year-old resident of Daliganj tested positive for the vector-borne dengue virus on Tuesday after he was examined by doctors at King George's Medical University (KGMU). He was prescribed medicines and sent home. TimesViewLack of coordination not only defeats the purpose of controlling the mosquito population, it also leads to wastage of time, money and resources. The authorities refuse to learn lessons from the past while common people suffer the consequences. Instead of planning a campaign just for July, the district health department and LMC could have drawn up a plan for the entire monsoon well in advance. In fact, a coordination committee can be formed with the objective to carry out joint exercises round the year.People in Daliganj told TOI that there had been no concerted efforts to control the mosquito population through fogging and spraying of larvicides for a month or so.

The health department and LMC carried out a joint operation for a month only in July, but the team work was not carried forward in August. ""We have not seen any LMC fogging vehicle in our area. After sundown, it is a full-on battle with mosquitoes. We have to wear sleeved clothes and use strong repellents,"" said Vaishnavi Jaiswal in Indiranagar. Rajajipuram resident Anupam Bisaria said they had stopped enjoying a garden stroll in the evenings. ""No fogging has been done this month. The LMC hasn't sprayed chemicals to kill mosquito larvae either."" Kirti Singh of Sarojininagar recalled that a health department team came in July when a person in her neighbourhood was diagnosed with dengue. ""Since then, no one has visited our locality."" LMC health officer SK Rawat admitted that joint efforts were required to tackle the sting menace.

Lucknow,Tariff hike on anvil: Your power bill to soar by 20%,"LUCKNOW: Your power bill is set to escalate by around 20% from September with UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) giving final touches to the new tariff, proposed by the state power utility, UPPCL. However, the electricity watchdog will take the final call on the hike. So, if you have been paying a monthly power bill of Rs 3000, you may cough up Rs 500 more. Talking to TOI, a top UPERC official said, the voluminous Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR), which is suggestive of the new tariff, has been completed and is likely to be tabled before UPERC chairman RP Singh for approval next week. The hike, which will roll out after nearly two years, was shelved in 2018 in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections. The commission will soon issue the notification of the new tariff order. Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) had suggested a hike in June this year, after which it was taken up by the electricity watchdog, which held a series of public hearings in different regions of the state in the jurisdiction of distribution companies.

Similarly, for power consumption between 151-300 units, the proposed hike is between Rs 5.40 and Rs 6.50, an escalation of 20%.Consumption between 301-500 units will invite a 13% hike from Rs 6.20 to Rs 7. The tariff will rise from Rs 6.50 to Rs 7.50 if the monthly consumption goes above 500 units, a 15% jump. Even fixed monthly charge for a domestic connection is proposed to be upped by 10%.

Had police been vigilant and checked teenagers from driving without helmets and tripling, the accident could probably have been averted.

GDA vice-chairman Kanchan Verma said the roads will be made free from encroachments and have footpaths and greenery so that “in future they can be taken as the benchmark for developing other roads of the city”. “The initiative will start with removing squatters from roads. Once done, it will solve almost half the problems. Officials have been directed to make public announcements asking squatters and shopkeepers to remove encroachments. Then repair and expansion work will be carried out,” she said. Officials said the central verge of these roads will be beautified and proper maintenance of streetlights will be done. “These roads will also have proper space for footpaths and drains so that waterlogging does not take place. We also plan to deploy staff who will conduct periodical inspection to ensure that squatters do not return,” the VC added.

Ghaziabad,Paranoia runs deep in Ghaziabad amid child-lifting rumours,"GHAZIABAD: Masuri is paranoid. Villagers here say they haven’t been sleeping at night to prevent children from being kidnapped. And while anxiety runs deep in the still nights, the days see violence stemming from this same fear. To put a stop to these “kidnappings”, the villagers have taken the law into their own hands, beating up people they ‘feel’ could be child-lifters. Three cases have been reported in the last seven days where local mobs have thrashed strangers on suspicion of being child-lifters, putting the village at the epicentre of this frightening trend in Ghaziabad. Ask anyone here, and the reply one will get is that the fears are not unfounded. Several children have gone missing from here, they say, though police records put the number of missing kids in all of Ghaziabad this year at 27. In Masuri, though, disappointment with police has catalysed into anger and vigilantism because of a sudden surge of rumours about gangs of kidnappers lurking around. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.The villagers are reading about it on their phones, hearing others talk about it night and day. They are in an echo chamber, fed and enhanced continuously by rampant sharing of falsehoods on chat groups and algorithm-curated social media timelines that simply give them what they want to read. It has reinforced their fears, and convinced them what they have been reading is true. In one such clip received by a villager in Piplera on WhatsApp, a youth, about 20 years old, is seen tied to a pole. People have surrounded him from all sides and some of them are slapping him and asking him questions about how he lures children. The youth, who seems to be under a lot of strain, confesses to his crime, blurting out the names of villages from where he and his friends have stolen kids. Several members of his gang are on the prowl, he adds. The youth says organs from the kids are sold to private hospitals. The footage, believed to have been shot in Bhopal, ends with the person filming asking people to remain alert and spread the message. While no one knows who is making the videos, or where the text messages originate, they have created such terror that villagers are wary of every new person. Even this correspondent faced stern questions and locals opened up only after they saw an identity card. “The situation is bad here. Locals have caught five to six people for trying to steal children. But we are not getting any support from police. They ask us to hand over the child-lifters to them, and later they are released without any action,” says Mohammad Raees, former pradhan of Piplera, a village located just 500 metres from Masuri police station. “These days you cannot be sure about anyone. Who knows in which form they are roaming. We need to be sure about with whom we are speaking,” says Hazi Zameer Ahmed, a farmer, adding he has four kids. Rumour mongering is not new but the before the internet, their effects wouldn’t be this disastrous, says psychiatrist Dr Rakesh Chandra. “In past, there were rumours about stories about monkey-man. Rumours spread like wildfire through mouth-to-mouth gossips too. If rumours remain in circulation for a longer time, it becomes more vicious,” he explains. Cases of mob attacks have also been reported from Loni, Vijay Nagar and Tronica City. According to police, it all started with a person from Moradabad, who allegedly had a mental health issue, and was found roaming aimlessly in Dasna railway station on August 22. People on the platform turned violent and would have killed him had it not been for quick police action. Later, two back-to-back incidents were reported. A 24-year-old farm hand was attacked in Nidori Village on August 24 after people spread the rumour that the youth was looking for a target. A day later, two youths from Delhi, who were seeking charity for an ashram, were beaten up in Akash Nagar in Masuri. This time, police arrested four for spreading rumours. The four even tried to produce false evidence of child-lifting, says Naresh Kumar Singh, SHO, Masuri police station. In several cases, images and videos of atrocities on children in other countries are being shared on social media, as those of child-lifting incidents in India. A photograph of Masuri police saving the man in Dasna on August 22 was being circulated in Gwalior as the image of police arresting a child abductor, cops shared.

Lucknow,Mysterious death of UP cop on VIP duty,"LUCKNOW: A head constable posted in the VIP security wing of Uttar Pradesh police was found dead, with a bullet injury in his head, on the ground floor of the security headquarters in New Hyderabad area on Friday. While the police claimed that the constable, Devi Shankar Mishra (54), shot himself on the temple with his 9mm revolver, the cop’s family alleged he had been murdered by an inspector with whom he had an altercation on Thursday.

The state government will submit a report to the high court. “We’ve categorically said IMT-Ghaziabad will have to pay up as per current circle rate for the land that it is illegally holding up,” said Kanchan Verma, vice chairperson, GDA. “As per the current circle rate, the cost comes to around Rs 50 crore,” she added.
