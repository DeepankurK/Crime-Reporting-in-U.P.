Ghaziabad,Why dust bowl Ghaziabad is India’s pollution hotspot,"GHAZIABAD: Dust that won’t disperse and traffic congestions that don’t ease — the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified these as the factors exacerbating air pollution in Ghaziabad, one of the most polluted cities in the country at the moment. “We identified over 20 areas in the city where dust pollution is the most severe. Different agencies and departments have been asked to carry out water sprinkling since the Graded Response Action Plan kicked in. The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation is responsible for water sprinkling along a 90-km stretch within the city’s municipal limits and for mechanized sweeping along another 106-km stretch,” a district official said. Track the pollution level in your cityOn paper, regular water sprinkling is being done on several such stretches — Mohan Nagar to GT Road, Sahibabad to Maharajpur, Sahibabad to Chandra Vihar, Meerut Road to Dudheshwarnath Temple, Vasundhara to Prahladgarhi and Dabur Chowk to UP Gate, among others — to control dust pollution. On the ground, it does not show. Unpaved stretches – in Nandgram, Loni’s Rashid Nagar, Bhatta Number 5 Road in Sikroad, Vijay Nagar bypass and Siddharth Vihar — remain clouded in dust all through the day. The official explanation was that these roads are “interior” ones. “These stretches are sources of dust pollution, but are internal roads within colonies. We have taken care of the main roads, which are in good shape,” the district official said. Then there are areas – in Indirapuram and Shastri Nagar – with no green paving, which doesn’t help control dust either. Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) vice-chairperson Kanchan Verma offered a defence: “Green paving has been done across most of the city, but there are many pavements we are yet to cover. The immediate problem that we face is that of encroachment by street vendors. Evicting them from the roads is a major challenge, because of which we have not been able to complete green paving on many stretches.” For now, the Authority has identified sections it plans to develop as “model roads”. “We have selected 10 spots where these model roads will have green paving. But work on it will be finished only by next year,” Verma added. For traffic congestion, the other big contributor to Ghaziabad’s pollution, the GDA has brought the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) on board to prepare a traffic mobility plan. “The CRRI has pointed out 14 major intersections with the highest traffic congestion — the most prominent being GDA Old Bus Stand, Choudhary Mor, Indirapuram SRS Cinemas and Kanawani Intersection. The CRRI has also recommended changes in road design in some places. We have implemented the recommendations in Indirapuram and will do so in other parts of the city soon,” Verma said. "

Lucknow,Lucknow: Blame foul air for cutting your life short by 8.6 years,"LUCKNOW: Life expectancy in UP can increase by 8.6 years if concentration of superfine particles (PM 2.5) is brought down to permissible limit, says a study on air quality life index (AQLI) released by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) on Thursday. Recognised by World Health Organisation (WHO), the study has found that continuous exposure to PM 2.5 damages the respiratory system, the heart and the brain. This makes people age faster and reduces their life expectancy, said Ashirbad S. Raha, senior associate director of communications at EPIC's Delhi branch. ""The permissible PM 2.5 level, according to WHO, is 10 microgram per cubic metre of air. Sustained exposure to an additional 10 microgram per cubic metre can reduce life expectancy by 0.98 years.

Track the pollution level in your cityThe study has also found that the annual average PM 2.5 concentration in the air of UP is 8-9 times higher than the permissible limit. ""In other words, foul air is reducing life expectancy of the people in this state by 8.6 years,"" Raha said. Life expectancy is the average period a person may expect to live. According to government data, the life expectancy in UP is around 64 years. The EPIC study used satellite derived data to measure the annual average concentration of PM 2.5 in all the 75 districts of the state and its impact on life expectancy in each district. The average of the districts was taken to find the impact of pollution on life expectancy in UP. Data revealed that Hapur is on top of the low life expectancy table with a reduction by 11.18 years, followed by Bulandshahr (11.13 years) and Ghaziabad (10.74 years). "

Lucknow,UP government partially shuts three power plants post Diwali,"LUCKNOW: Amid UP government's claim of providing 24-hour power supply in the state till November 3, three power plants were partially shut on October 28, resulting in overall dip in power generation by over 1,000MW on a single day. The units that have been shut are: three units each of 300MW capacity at Rosa thermal power plant in Shahjahanpur, and two units each of 110MW capacity at Harduaganj plant in Aligarh and Parichha plant in Jhansi. These units have not been revived yet. According to the data of Northern Region Load Dispatch Centre, all the units faced a ""reserve shutdown"", meaning they were forcibly closed following the dip in demand for power. On Diwali, the demand had touched 20,000MW and subsequently fell to around 15,000MW. The demand for power registered a significant fall after Diwali and therefore the units which could have wheeled in power to the state grid had to be shut down, said a senior official of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited. Last month, three big units of 660MW each in Bara Meja and Lalitpur faced a shutdown following shortage of coal and technical problem. The units, which are yet to be restored, have led to deficit of nearly 2000MW power supply in the state. Besides, the 110MW unit in Parichha which has been put in the refurbishment mode since July, is yet to light up. Energy minister Srikant Sharma said the state government was committed to provide 24-hour power supply in urban as well as rural areas.

The accused, Ashok Yadav, was a fruit and vegetable seller at Sahibabad wholesale market.""  Yadav knew the mother of one of the girls and used to visit their house often. On July 14, he visited the house and found the girls playing there. He lured them to the Sahibabad market on the pretext of buying them food and then took them to a secluded room and raped them.

A show-cause notice has also been issued to the SHO of Loni border police station over the amassing of e-waste by illegal vendors in the area, officials said.  TOI has already reported that these illegal units are involved in melting battery, cables and other e-waste material to procure valuable metal residues for local industries. The toxic fumes thus generated leads to a sudden spike in PM10 levels and other pollutants in the vicinity. Loni's air quality index is the worst in Ghaziabad currently.  DM Ajay Shankar Pandey, who led the team along with the SSP, said that e-waste is being brought to Ghaziabad from Delhi's border area and that he will write to the authorities in the national capital to look into the matter. Earlier, the district authorities had dismantled 30 such units in Loni and registered an FIR against five persons. ""We have already requested the Central Pollution Control Board to conduct an investigation and suggest ways to deal with the problem of e-waste and its disposal,"" he said.  The SDM and the tehsildar have also been asked to prepare a list of vendors, who procure e-waste and then dispose them here in Loni, along with the names of people on whose land this activity is going on. ""Not only the recyclers of e-waste but the owners of the land where the same is dumped will be booked under the Gangster Act,"" he said.  ""The SHO of Loni has asked to submit a report on the supply chain of waste and who all are involved in this illegal business,"" the DM added.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Hit-and-run accidents claimed one life every day in 2017, two hurt daily","LUCKNOW: One person was killed almost every day in a hit-and-run in the state capital in 2017, according to the recently released National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. Of the total 413 road deaths in the city that year, 339 were victims of hit-and-run accidents. In terms of this absolute number, Lucknow is in third place among the 19 ‘metropolitan cities’ after Delhi (458) and Jaipur (441). If the rate of incidence per one lakh population is considered, the state capital with 11.2 is in second place after Jaipur (13.3). Not just deaths, the number of those injured owing to rash driving is also high in Lucknow. On an average, two persons are injured daily given that the total number for 2017 was 807. In this category, Lucknow ranks fifth among the 19 cities. Two years down the line, there has been no let-up in hitand-run accidents in Lucknow. In most cases in 2019, police have not been able to identify the vehicles, let alone catch the driver. Experts feel the increase in number of vehicles and lack of stringent punishment are responsible for both reckless driving and resulting accidents. As recently as October 16, a 21-year-old mechanical engineering student was run over by a speeding car in front his college on Sultanpur highway. The vehicle has not been identified. In another hit-and-run on September 15, a toddler was crushed under the wheels of an SUV in Gomtinagar extension. The killer vehicle is yet to be tracked down. SP Vikrant Vir said surveillance cameras were being installed across the city. “These will help us catch culprits of hit-and-run cases. The cameras will also serve as deterrent for reckless motorists and bikers,” he added. "
Ghaziabad,Delhi's air quality drops to 'emergency' category first time since January,"NEW DELHI: The blanket of haze over Delhi thickened on Friday morning with the national capital's pollution levels increasing overnight by around 50 points, taking the overall air quality index to 459. A Central Pollution Control Board official said the AQI entered the ""severe plus"" or ""emergency"" category late Thursday night, the first time since January this year. Track the pollution level in your cityIf the air quality persists in the ""severe plus"" category for more than 48 hours, emergency measures such as odd-even car rationing scheme, banning entry of trucks, construction activities and shutting down schools are taken under the Graded Response Action Plan, the official said. The hazardous pollution levels forced a number of people to miss morning walks and other activities. Shubhomoy Sikdar, a Delhi-based journalist, said the pollution levels gave him a throat infection and he had to skip his daily sports session. Amanpreet Singh, a resident of Jangpura, said he has been avoiding morning and evening walks and preferring to stay indoors. The number of masked faces continued to grow as the city remained shrouded in pungent haze for the fourth consecutive day. At 8.30 am, the capital's overall air quality index stood at 459. It was 410 at 8 pm on Thursday. All the 37 air quality monitoring stations across Delhi recorded the air quality in the severe category on Friday morning. Bawana was the most-polluted area with an AQI of 497, followed by Delhi Technological University (487), Wazirpur (485), Anand Vihar (484) and Vivek Vihar (482). Neighbouring Ghaziabad was the most-polluted city in the country, with the levels of PM2.5 -- tiny particulate matter less than 2.5 microns that can enter deep into the lungs -- reaching as high as 493. Greater Noida (480), Noida (477), and Faridabad (432) also breathed extremely polluted air. An AQI between 0-50 is considered “good”, 51-100 “satisfactory”, 101-200 “moderate”, 201-300 “poor”, 301-400 “very poor”, and 401-500 “severe”. Above 500 is “severe-plus or emergency” category. Delhi is impatiently hoping for favourable meteorological conditions to blow away the toxic air, as health experts said the hazardous air pollution has become a serious health concern for about 2 crore residents. ""Intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette. So whether the PM2.5 level is 700 or 300 units, the impact is still as bad. People need to take precautions, especially those suffering from asthma, bronchitis or other respiratory illness,"" said Dr Arvind Kumar, lung surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here. Weather experts said increased wind speed due to a fresh western disturbance approaching the northern region would help disperse pollutants faster from Saturday. Parents are a worried lot as health experts say children breathe faster, taking in more pollutants. Many took to Twitter to demand that schools be shut till the situation ameliorates. ""We, as parents, request Delhi government to keep all schools (pvt and govt) shut for the time being,"" Anil Atri, a Delhi resident, posted on the microblogging site. ""Whole Delhi air at hazardous levels now. Pollution at its peak. Activate all emergency measures. Close down schools @msisodia (sic),"" another resident tweeted. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had on Wednesday said the decision to shut schools would be taken ""when the need arises"". In November 2017, the government had shut schools for a few days due to the deteriorating air quality. The government, however, started distributing 50 lakh N95 masks, considered one of the good quality masks for tackling smog, among school students in Delhi on Friday morning. Meanwhile, the BCCI said it would carry on with the India-Bangladesh T20 at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds on Sunday, disregarding concerns raised by environmentalists about the health of players and thousands of spectators. The AQI takes into account five chief pollutants -- particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres (PM10), PM2.5, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and health concerns. "

Lucknow,#LucknowChokes: Docs suggest measures to survive in the city,"This might be the ‘cleanest’ Diwali Lucknow has seenin recent years but the pollution level in the city is still in the severe/hazardous level. The day after Diwali, the city woke up to a drastically worsened air quality with the air quality index (AQI) rising to a ‘hazardous’ 326 and the number of people visiting hospitals with respiratory ailments going up by 15% as per reports. According to doctors the number of people complaining of respiratory problems, cough and sore throat has gone up by more than 30% in the past few days. Post Diwali, the air quality in Lucknow deteriorated further to 314 on Tuesday from being 304 on Monday, and went up even more on Wednesday. On Friday, till afternoon, the AQI in Lucknow was again in the red with it touching 324 at 3.30 PM, well over the hazardous range with Rajajipuram being the most polluted area with an AQI of 375 followed by Qiaserbagh with an AQI of 322.  While people are trying to do their bit by using air purifiers in their homes and going out wearing masks, doctors share a few suggestions to help people go about their daily lives in the toxic air. (BCCL)ENCOURAGE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN HOMEAnupam Sibal, Group Medical Director, Apollo Hospitals Group, accepts that the situation has been better this year but adds that the days after Diwali actually represent the damage that has happened. “When you look out of the window today, you can really see the damage that has happened to the environment. Things that we can do as parents is that we should not encourage any outdoor activities when the AQI is so high. The best time for a child to go out would be in the afternoon if they have to go to the park. We need to encourage activities within the house. Outdoor activities in schools have also been curtailed, though this is something that kids should not have to deal with, but in this situation, it is best advised to avoid being outside. If you have a history of respiratory problems or you feel uncomfortable going out, stepping outside is not recommended. While the AQI going beyond 300 is an important factor, the number is not everything. You have to see how you are feeling, irrespective of AQI levels,” he says. AVOID USING AGARBATTIS, MOSQUITO SPRAYS AND CAMPHORVivek Nangia, Director and Head of Pulmonology at Fortis Flt Lt Rajan Dhall Hospital, adds, “We need to decide on our outdoor activities depending on the AQI level. When the AQI is more than 400, then people should avoid going out. We should be restricting outdoor movement to the bare minimum and keep our indoor environment as clean as possible. Avoid using agarbattis, mosquito repellent sprays or using camphor inside your home. These are simple measures that one should be taking. Take a walk only when it is bright and sunny outside.” Hazratganj shrouded in smog on Friday (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Hazratganj shrouded in smog on Friday (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHINGRashmi Sharma, Consultant Dermatologist at Fortis Hospital, Delhi, says that people are advised to wear protective clothing in this weather. ""With increasing level of air pollution, problems like complexion mediated change, dryness, premature ageing, flare up of conditions like allergic-contact dermatitis, irritant-contact dermatitis, acne, psoriasis and eczema also increases. I recommend that people should avoid going out, and if you do, wash your face with a soap-free cleanser once you come back. You should frequently re-apply moisturiser and sunscreen should be used four-five times a day. In your diet, you should increase citrus fruits, and consume apples and cranberries. When going out, cover your face, wear bandanas, glasses, hand gloves and focus on protective clothing,” she advises. Meanwhile. Infectious Disease expert, KGMU, Dr Amita Jain, says, “People should try and stay indoors as much as possible specially in the early mornings and evenings. Also, wearing a good quality mask is imperative for the people right now.” KEEP YOURSELF HYDRATED Dr Rajiv Garg, Professor at the Dept of Respiratory Medicine, and Pulmonologist, KGMU, said, “The number of patients suffering from respiratory problems, specially asthma and COPD has increased by 30% off late. If the Air Quality Index (AQI) goes higher than 300, it is considered hazardous. If there is about particulate matter (PM) 22 micro grams/cubic metre in air, that’ll be equal to smoking one cigarette. In such cases, all I can suggest is for people to keep indoors or if at all they can’t avoid it, they should use good quality masks. Hydration is another helpful thing in such cases.” This Diwali, once again the air quality in Lucknow dipped to ‘hazardous’ levels, with the PM 2.5 concentration crossing 600 on the night of Diwali (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) This Diwali, once again the air quality in Lucknow dipped to ‘hazardous’ levels, with the PM 2.5 concentration crossing 600 on the night of Diwali (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) INSTALL AIR PURIFIERS IN SCHOOLSNeerav Arora, a homeopathy doctor in the city, advises, “There has been a massive increase in the number of patients suffering from respiratory allergies, bronchial asthma, acute exacerbation of COPD, pneumonia and possibly Tuberculosis in the last 15 days with increase in the air pollution and the smog settling down. As immediate precautions, one should maintain cleanliness in and around their houses, clean hands on a regular basis, wear masks before walking out in the open, avoid exposure to people already suffering from acute infections, keeping yourself well hydrated and avoid early morning and late evening walks."" Adding further Arora says, “Taking vitamin C and Omega 3 fatty acids on a regular basis can help fight respiratory infections and allergies. We do not recommend masks for kids below the age of three because they can choke. Schools should ensure that they have air purifiers inside classrooms. Schools and parents should cut down on sports and games for kids because when you do any physical activity, your heartbeat goes up and you inhale more pollutants. Another age group that gets really affected by the poor air quality is the elderly. Using a mask is very important whenever going out and use air purifiers in cars as well.”  — With inputs from Yashi Agarwal "
Kanpur,"Respect SC judgment, say mosques across UP","AYODHYA/LUCKNOW: Mosques across Uttar Pradesh on Friday made an ‘elaan’ (announcement) for peace and brotherhood, and for respecting the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya dispute due by the 17 th of this month. “Avoid any slogans, celebrations or complaints, and exhort national integration so that the country’s harmony is undisturbed,” was the collective message delivered to millions of Muslims in the state. In Lucknow, Imam of Aishbagh Eidgah and executive member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali made an emphatic appeal to this effect in his address before Friday prayers. Mosques in Ayodhya and adjoining Faizabad also made appeals for peace. “There should be no outward celebrations or expression of remorse, sloganeering or such activities that hurt the religious sentiments of other communities after the verdict,” declared Mahali. “When the SC decides, we should all remember that the decision has been made by the highest court of law, and it should be respected by each one of us,” he added at the Eidgah in a room full of namazis. He also asked the youth to bust the myths about Islam on social media and appealed to all to hold national unity above all. “The current Islamic month of Rabi-ul-Awwal is Prophet Muhammad’s birth month. The Prophet made clear that Islam spreads love, harmony and brotherhood among all creations of Allah. He asked us to stay away from animosity. This is the time we prove with our actions that Islam is indeed a religion of peace,” said the cleric. Disseminating his appeal through social media, Mahali said, “To maintain peace is the responsibility of all and it has been a positive step that Hindu organisations like RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad have also asked for the same. The gesture is not limited to one community but has to be reciprocated. It is not a time to be fearful but to repose all trust in the country’s justice system.” Similar appeals, he confirmed to TOI, were made at mosques in Sitapur, Kanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Lakhimpur, Bahraich, Gorakhpur, Leherpur and other places. At Ayodhya’s Kotiya Masjid, Imam Ishtiaq Ahmed addressed devotees. “Everyone was asked to maintain calm in Ayodhya and accept the apex court’s verdict. No event should be given a communal colour,” said Babri Masjid litigant Iqbal Ansari, who was present at Kotiya mosque. Another litigant, Mohammad Umar, who attended prayers at Kewda Masjid of Ayodhya, said: “We were assured by the administration in a meeting on Wednesday that adequate security is present and there will be no breach of peace. We decided to share that assurance with our brethren, who were worried that mob from outside of Ayodhya will ruin peace here.” “The chief Imam told everyone to not be scared or leave the city but to respect the SC’s verdict,” he added. Even at political levels, efforts were made in Ayodhya for peace by holding peace meetings with influential locals. Such meetings were held by Peace Party on Thursday and Samajwadi Party on Friday.

Besides, 46 fresh dengue cases were reported, the highest in a single day this year. TimesViewThe dengue outbreak in the city has now assumed menacing proportion with over 1000 cases and six deaths. Most cases and deaths were reported in October which shows that anti-mosquito measures taken by the authorities failed in containing the virus. TOI had earlier highlighted reported how lack of coordination between the district health department and the Lucknow Municipal Corporation has taken the sting out of drive against dengue. People in many locality complained that anti-larvae spray is not followed by adequate fogging. Also, no action has been taken against vacant plots where water-logging has become haven for mosquito breeding. Authorities need to involve resident welfare associations and run a massive awareness as well as preventive campaign against dengue. The three deaths confirmed on Friday had taken place earlier but were taken 'on record' after an audit reported by various hospitals to chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Narendra Agarwal.  ""After examining the documents of the death cases provided by the hospitals, we found that three more patients had died due to dengue in October,"" said the CMO.

The fate of the other NCR cities was similar, with AQI touching 500 in Noida, 496 in Ghaziabad and Greater Noida, 479 in Faridabad and 469 in Gurugram. Track the pollution level in your cityThe CPCB central control room showed PM2.5 in Delhi crossing the severe plus level of 300 micrograms per cubic metre and recorded 319 micrograms per cubic metre at 3am on Friday. According to SAFAR, the forecasting agency under the Union ministry of earth sciences, stubble burning contributed 44% to the PM2.5 load. PM10 also breached the severe plus mark of 500 microgram per cubic metre. The safe standards for these ultrafine pollutants are, respectively, 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre. At 8pm, the PM2.5 and PM10 readings were, respectively, 380.2 and 569.6 micrograms per cubic metre. There isn’t much to look forward to with the meteorological department saying the air quality will likely remain foul till at least Sunday. “Wind speed picked up a bit on Friday evening. However, substantial improvement is not expected before Sunday morning. In fact, the pollution level might remain severe on Sunday as well,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD scientist. EPCA chairman Bhure Lal wrote to the chief secretaries of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and UP and directed the cessation of construction activities, hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida till the morning of November 5. All coal and other fuel-based industries that hadn’t shifted to natural gas or agro-residue too would remain shut in Faridabad, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Noida, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwadi, Greater Noida, Sonipat and Panipat till November 5 morning. Lal noted that there were festivals coming up, but banned the use of any firecrackers. He said Diwali proved that fireworks resulted in “accumulation of toxins in the air”. Gurugram had its first severe-level pollution on Friday (AQI 469), as did Manesar (AQI 427). Haryana State Pollution Control Board promptly asked all district administrations, industries, construction companies and regional officers to comply with the EPCA bans. An advisory was also issued to the education department to restrict outdoor activities of students. HSPCB member secretary S. Narayan told TOI, “We are also undertaking measures like sprinkling of water and reducing road dust.” The AQI touched the 500 mark in Noida at around 5pm on Friday and it shared with neighbouring Ghaziabad the distinction of being the most polluted cities in the country. Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board officials warned that impurity level was likely to spike by midnight “because there is no ventilation”. UPCCB official Anil Singh said, “While we are taking action to mitigate dust pollution in Noida with water sprinklers and other measures, a low wind speed is causing a continuous build-up of pollutants.” "

Lucknow,Lucknow: Commuters flouted traffic rules while cops remained busy inaugurating the Road Safety Month close by,"Road Safety Month (November) in the city is a paradox in itself. While police were busy flagging off the campaign at 1090 Crossing on Friday, people were actively flouting traffic rules unchallenged barely 50 metre away. Between 4pm and 5pm, TOI saw violations ranging from quintuple-riding (five on a two-wheeler) and helmetless biking by both policemen and commoners to speeding, driving without seat belts and driving in wrong lane. Bikers and motorists on phone was a common sight; and then, there were overloaded passenger and goods vehicles. TimesViewThe inauguration of ‘Road Safety Month’ meant to enforce traffic rules and make people aware of law turned out to be an eyewash. Not only violators went past police squad at the inaugural venue with impunity, some who were caught got away without any challan by making lame excuses. This explains why people do not take traffic rules seriously in the city. Discipline becomes a habit only when people are made to understand that the traffic rules are for their own safety and the laws are enforced strictly.The opening ceremony, which began around 4pm, was attended by the who’s who of police, including ADG (Lucknow zone), IG (Lucknow range), IG (traffic), DIG (traffic) and the SSP. Stone’s throw from the function and right under the nose of senior officers, Young Lucknow was being reckless as ever while senior citizens tried to stick to safety guidelines. “We are faster than cops. We can play dodge forever. They will never catch us,” said one among three youths on a bike. Most auto-rickshaw drivers at 1090 Crossing were without uniform and were ferrying more than three passengers. Cars had tinted windows and most people behind the wheel forgot to strap on the seat belt. Lucknow police spokesperson Ashish Dwivedi, however, claimed they had booked 922 people for flouting traffic rules on Day One of the safety month. “As many as 318 were biking without helmet, 89 were penalised for driving in wrong direction,” he said. Dwivedi added that senior police officers made people aware about traffic rules and safety signboards at the inauguration. "
Lucknow,Bus conductor molests woman in Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW: A 21-year-old woman was allegedly molested by the conductor of Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) bus on Thursday, while she was travelling from Firozabad to Lucknow. According to police, the woman is a resident of Mathura and boarded the bus for Lucknow. As the bus was packed, she had to sit next to the conductor. When the bus reached Alambagh bus station, the conductor allegedly started touching her inappropriately. When she objected, he started arguing with her. The woman got down from the bus at Alambagh and later lodged a complaint on Friday.

Lucknow,How used became chic,"Pre-loved fashion has found a new market as shoppers look for smart and sustainable luxuryOn the eve of Karva Chauth this year, a young woman decided to get an Italian clutch for her mother-in-law. A few discreet calls later, not only did she find a coveted designer purse at a substantially lower price, but it came with a happy little note on how she was supporting sustainability. The latest entrant in feel-good commerce, is ‘pre-loved’, ‘gently-loved’ or ‘tried-and-treasured’ luxury products, euphemisms for being, essentially, second-hand. Companies that pride themselves on privacy — for both the buyer and seller — are creating a neat marketplace for those who have a glut of high-luxe bags, shoes and clothes and also those who covet them. Those in the business point to three areas that have prompted this change: the new trend in ‘sustainable living’, which has become the buzzword even among children; a growing exposure to the West, which has long loved ‘vintage fashion’ in all its stained and faded glory; and that abiding urge to acquire a designer product. As Mansi Poddar, who runs a lifestyle website and does pop-ups which include curated vintage clothing, says, “While a certain type of Indian woman may have been perfectly comfortable wearing a grandmother’s hand-me-down sari, she was not as comfortable buying a second-hand branded dress or accessory. Today, that has changed.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSSaudi's response on India's oil reserves 'undiplomatic': PradhanUnion minister for oil, petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday termed Saudi Arabia's response on India's strategic oil reserves as 'undiplomatic' and said that India is conscious about its interest.PM Modi invites 50 Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to visit IndiaAddressing Bangladesh's 50th Independence Day anniversary at the National Parade Square, Modi said: ""It is a happy coincidence that the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's liberation and the milestone of the 75th year of India's independence have arrived together.Recently, a young mother received a request on her mommy WhatsApp chat group from someone looking around for a ‘pre-loved cycle’ for her five year-old’s birthday gift. “Maybe all those birthday party invites which ask for ‘blessings only’ will now turn into ‘second hand only’!” she joked. The mindset of people is changing, and people are now talking about buying pre-owned luxury products openly and confidently, says Monica Gupta, who runs triedandtreasured.com. When Gupta hosted her first exhibition in Mumbai a year ago, she felt that there was a slight social stigma attached to the idea. “By my second exhibition, I had women flocking to get my products. I remember I didn’t have my credit card machine set up, and there were people doing RTGS transactions there and then,” says Gupta, who gets clients from metros as well as Tier 2 cities Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Lucknow. “You begin to see the potential of a market which is aspirational but obviously not at exorbitant prices.” Now, many women who buy high-luxe products, are consciously keeping the packaging and invoices because they know that there is an avenue for resale, adds Jain. In fact, there is a buzzing market among collectors worldwide for high-end luxe items which may have gone out of circulation. So, an Italian python-skin purse may even fetch a higher price today than its original price. Or, a vintage designer collection from the seventies may be coveted for its sheer period beauty. When Poddar held a vintage pop-up in Mumbai last year, curated by the style queen Roohi Jaikishan for charity, it was a sellout. “These weren’t people who couldn’t afford new fashion, it was more people who knew that something they were buying was a 60s piece which you wouldn’t get again,” she says. Long before ‘pre-loved’ and ‘vintage’ popped up on Instagram, Indians have been veteran upcyclers, used to wearing hand-me-downs passed down from cousins, As Hanna Stromgren Khan, co-founder of VRTT vintage, says, “The Indian culture is fairly used to the whole idea of passing on. What’s new here is the whole transaction aspect of it.” VRTT vintage, describes itself as a company that “highlights the benefits and fun of passing on personal culture… our aim is not only to change the way we consume fashion, but also to put environment and future first…”. The way the pass-on process works is that it takes in branded items like shoes, bags, accessories or clothing whose original retail price was no less than Rs 15,000. The pieces are then authenticated, approved, and remain on a consignment basis for about 90 days. The seller gets 65% of the sale price, and 5% goes to charity. “Sustainability is on everyone’s radar,” says Stromgren Khan. “Today, everyone wants to be engaged in activities that are good for the environment.” "

There was a studio in our locality and Shekhar used to do the advertising work of the studio and I knew the owner. So one fine day I was walking into the studio and he was coming out and he asked me ‘tu yahan kya kar raha hai’, and I asked him the same question.

At that point in time, we were working separately, Vishal and Shekhar were two different entities. But then we both heard each other’s music and we liked the work. And the rest as they say is history...The title track of the movie was still left to be done so we decided to do it together and since then 20 years have passed."" In all the talent hunt and reality shows on TV, contestants are always singing Bollywood compositions sung and composed by others. Talk about this and Vishal, a judge on a reality show, says that he would love for the contestants to sing their own composition rather than copy older singers and songs. ""Copying other singers style can only make an artist learn music but will stop him or her to grow as a musician. I have never learned any music, I learned from listening to other people sing. So it took me ten long years to understand that to learn and to copy are two different things. And to try and sing consciously like my influences, that was a very big step for me as a musician. And these contestants are very new, they are still young and learning. So it is not a bad thing if they copy someone’s singing style whom they consider their influence. But I always try to make them understand that you can always learn by copying but you can never grow. You’ll end up being an ordinary singer. It is obvious because if we can access an original copy, why would we go for the copies? There is no rule that a contestant cannot sing his original composition. I will love it if a contestant sings his original composition. Infact, I will encourage the artist wholeheartedly, as that is the true measure of a talent. The brass tacks basic facts is that a reality show can popularize you but for a short time, but becoming a musician will actually make you successful.

Lucknow,"Ahead of SC verdict, Muslims want paramilitary deployed in Ayodhya","FAIZABAD/LUCKNOW: Ahead of the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, “worried” Muslims in Ayodhya have asked the district administration to deploy central paramilitary forces in areas with dense population of their community. The demand was raised by representatives of the Muslim community during a meeting with the Faizabad administration. “We have full faith in the administration and are confident that it will ensure peace and harmony. But the deployment of central paramilitary forces will give more assurance to the community,” Jamiat Ulema Hind, Ayodhya unit general secretary Hafiz Irfaan told TOI. SSP Faizabad Ashish Tiwari told TOI, “Police have already been deployed in Muslim-dominated localities and central paramilitary forces will also be deployed soon. Civil police and some CRPF personnel are also keeping strict vigil in Muslim-dominated localities.” “We have asked Muslims not to panic and assured them that peace will not be disrupted in Ayodhya,” said DM Faizabad Anuj Kumar Jha. Meanwhile, UP CM Yogi Adityanath has asked his ministers to refrain from making any controversial statements on the Ayodhya verdict. Addressing ministers on Friday ahead of a cabinet meeting, the CM reportedly said that no one should make any “unwarranted comment” on the verdict. A source in the CM’s secretariat said, “RSS has been holding a series of meetings where it has been telling its cadre to refrain from provocative statements and actions after the verdict. In fact, when the CM went to Ayodhya for the Deepotsav, he met the seer community and asked them to refrain from saying anything controversial that could disturb peace.” BJP will hold meetings in the coming week to discuss what line the party would take on the verdict, keeping in view all possibilities.

Lucknow,2008 CRPF camp attack: 2 Pak nationals among 4 to hang,"RAMPUR: A local court in Rampur on Saturday awarded capital punishment to four men, including two Pakistani nationals, for the attack on a CRPF camp in Rampur in 2008 in which seven jawans of the paramilitary force and a civilian were killed. The four convicts include Imran Shahzad, a resident of Bhimhar in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK); Mohammad Farooq, a resident of Kangriwala area in Pakistan’s Gujranwala; Sharif, a resident of Rampur; and Sabauddin, a resident of Bihar’s Madhubani. The remaining two of the six convicted on Friday – Jung Bahadur, a resident of Moradabad, and Faheem Ansari of Mumbai – were given life imprisonment and 10 years in jail, respectively. Two of those sentence on Saturday — Mohammed Sabauddin Ahmed and Faheem Ansari — were earlier acquitted in the 26/11 Mumbai terror case. According to sources, Faheem Ansari, a resident of Goregaon area of Mumbai, and Sabauddin Ahmed, a native of Bihar, were co-accused in the 26/11 terror case along with Pakistan terrorist Ajmal Kasab. However, a special court in Mumbai acquitted the duo in 2010 and their acquittal was later upheld by the Supreme Court. After a Mumbai court had acquitted Faheem and Sabauddin in 2010, both were transferred to jails of Lucknow and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh. The court held Sabauddin guilty of attack on the CRPF camp and has been charged with murder and also under the Arms Act and the Explosive Act. However, Faheem was not found guilty in the attack but has been “found guilty for holding a fake Pakistani passport and also under the Arms Act”. “Pakistan nationals, Mohd Farooq and Imran Shehzad, were arrested from Lucknow in February 2008 and were lodged in Lucknow jail. They had undergone training in Pakistan,” said Singh. They are lodged in jails in Lucknow and Bareilly, ADG ATS Dhruva Kant Thakur said. The judgment pronounced by additional district and sessions judge Sanjeev Kumar said that all the four accused will hang till death under IPC’s sections 302 (murder), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) and under 121 (waging war against government of India). On the intervening night of December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2008, terrorists had attacked the Rampur-based CRPF group centre, in which seven CRPF jawans and one civilian were killed, while some jawans and citizens had sustained serious injuries. Cases were registered against eight persons under various sections of the IPC, the Arms Act, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, Explosive Substances Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

Vedanti said if anything unfortunate happened to him, the Congress leader should be held responsible for it. He also accused Congress and Pakistan of creating hurdles in the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. “Construction of Ram temple got delayed only due to hurdles created by Congress and Pakistan in regular hearing of the Ayodhya case in Supreme Court as they didn’t want the case to be settled,” said Vedanti and accused the Congress of doing divisive politics in the country since independence. “This is why people threw them (Congress) out of power in 2014,” he added. He also said the Sunni Waqf Board is getting funds from Pakistan and hiring costly lawyers to represent their case in Supreme Court. “I just wanted to question Sunni Waqf Board in this regard. While on one hand they cry that they are running short of funds to pay salary to their employees, on the other, they hire costly lawyers to represent their case in Supreme Court, which is not possible without financial support from Pakistan.” He also pleaded people not to raise provocative slogans on streets after the Supreme Court verdict, as it could disturb law and order. “Rather, it would be better if they indulge in puja and and other religious rituals within the confine of their homes,” Vedanti added.

Lucknow,PF scam: 2 UP discom officials arrested,"LUCKNOW: A former top employee and a suspended general manager of a discom of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) were on late Saturday arrested by the Yogi Adityanath government for violation in investment of more than Rs 2,200 crore of provident fund of corporation employees in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFCL), a company whose promoters are under Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe for links with a firm of Iqbal Mirchi, a former aide of Dawood Ibrahim. The state government decided to recommend CBI probe late on Saturday evening. The government said the incident will be probed by DG (EOW) till CBI takes over charge.The Lucknow Police have slapped charges of criminal breach of trust, forgery and fraud of valuable security against the two suspended UPPCL employees — GM of Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam P K Gupta and former director (finance) Sudhanshu Dwivedi. The FIR was registered following a political war of words that followed between Congress UP general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and UP government who traded barbs over the tenure of the alleged scam. The probe and subsequent arrest of the duo took place following a complaint by I M Kaushal, the chairman of trust of two employees’ funds: central provident fund (CPF) and general provident fund (GPF). Earlier, UP power minister Shrikant Sharma wrote on Twitter, “Investing employees provident fund money in DHFL is matter of serious concern. Stern action will be taken against those involved in it.” Later in the evening, Sharma wrote to CM Yogi Adityanath, seeking a CBI probe into investment of UPPCL employees provident funds in DHFCL. Sharma said that till CBI probe is initiated a high level inquiry be done in the case. The FIR states that though the decision to invest in any private firm or financial institution for a tenure of one to three years was first taken in February, 2014 but the sanction to invest in DHFL took place during the transition between then Samajwadi Party (SP) government and BJP government in March 2017. UPPCL chairman Alok Kumar said, “The investment of funds in DHFCL was gross violation of guidelines. The funds should have been deposited in government securities instead of fixed deposits of a private company.” The funds into DHFCL were invested in two ways. This included Rs 2631 crore from CPF and the other Rs 2267 crore from GPF was invested later. From the first tranche, Rs 1185 crore was returned to UPPCL while Rs 1491 crore was returned from the second tranche. “This still leaves the total balance amount of Rs 2,200 crore, which is a huge amount and will be recovered now. UPPCL will hand over provident fund matter to the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation,” said an official The row had erupted in July when the trust employees had raised a banner of protest against the UPPCL and power department. “A sum of Rs 1,600 crore is still with DHFCL. The government should get back this money. We also need an assurance that in future money with GPF or CPF trust is not be invested in private firms,” said union general secretary Rajeev Kumar Singh. Earlier, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targeted the government on the issue. “The UP BJP government invested the provident fund money of the state’s power corporation employees in a defaulting company like DHFL. Whose interest is being served through this investment of over Rs 2,000 crore which is the hard earned money of employees?” she said in a tweet. "
Lucknow,"At AQI 422, it’s a health emergency in Lucknow","LUCKNOW: The state capital remained shrouded in thick smog for the third consecutive day on Saturday and the air quality index (AQI) plummeted to a ‘severe’ 422 from ‘very poor’ 382 in 24 hours, but the authorities are yet to declare a public health emergency in the city. Track the pollution level in your cityThe spike in superfine particulate matter began around Diwali and increased almost three times in a week owing to fireworks, vehicular emission and conducive weather conditions, but no official health advisory or closure of schools like Delhi has been announced. Schools, both private and government, though were directed on Saturday to sprinkle water on their campuses to check pollution caused by dust. Vice-chairman of Lucknow Development Authority PN Singh has also ordered suspension of construction activities. From 155 on October 26, the AQI leaped by around 40 units a day in the past week to touch 422. The figure is nearly nine times higher than 50, the prescribed limit termed as ‘good air’ by the Central Pollution Control Board. Also, this is the second highest AQI this year after 436 on January 2. Times ViewCivic agencies are yet to take adequate measures to check air pollution despite the chief minister's directions. Besides garbage burning in open, construction activities and brick kilns without preventive measures continue unabated in the city. Sprinkling of water to prevent dust from polluting the atmosphere is limited to a few localities. Officers responsible for inaction should be booked for criminal negligence because this is a matter of public safety. Further, authorities should come up with a policy to tackle the problem in a planned manner ahead of the winter season, instead of reacting every year when pollution reaches alarming levels.Experts warn that the concentration of the microscopic and lethal PM 2.5 may breach the ‘hazardous’ 500 mark in the city in coming days if immediate measures are not taken. Exposure to such menacing levels of superfine pollutants can cause serious respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic bronchitis and allergic rhinitis, doctors maintained. Live air quality monitoring by CPCB suggests that the pollution levels in two areas of the city crossed 400 in the early hours of Saturday while a third inched closer to the ‘severe’ air quality bracket. The most polluted was the industrial hub of Talkatora with a PM 2.5 concentration of 410 microgram per cubic metre of air. It was followed by residential areas of Lalbagh and Aliganj with PM 2.5 concentrations of 402 and 393, respectively. The particulate matter concentration in these places was around seven times higher than the permissible limits of 60 microgram per cubic metre. While Talkatora was polluted because of industries, broken roads and garbage burning were the main culprits elsewhere, experts said. “We cannot control the weather as of now, but can take steps to check vehicular emission and smoke. There is an urgent need for formulation and strict implementation of a government policy on pollution control,” said environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta. "

Lucknow,"Refrain from statements on Ayodhya, CM Yogi Adityanath tells ministers","LUCKNOW: With the Ayodhya verdict expected anytime now, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked his ministers to refrain from making any controversial statements. In a meeting held on Friday, the CM reportedly said that no minister should say anything about the verdict, irrespective of whose favour it comes in. A minister confirmed: “The CM has told us to abstain from making unnecessary comments on the issue.” A source in the CM’s secretariat said this direction was in line with a larger programme which BJP has started in light of the expected verdict. “RSS has been holding a series of meetings where it has been telling its cadre to refrain from statements and actions on the verdict. In fact, when the CM went to Ayodhya for the Deepotsav, he met the seers and asked them to refrain from saying anything controversial or something that could disturb peace,” the source said.  BJP will hold meetings with its members in the coming week to discuss what line the party would take in the face of the various possible verdicts. "
Ghaziabad,Manager of petrol pump found hanging,"GHAZIABAD: A 65-year-old man, working as a manager with a petrol pump in Morta, was found hanging from the ceiling fan of his room. A note found near the body said he was committing suicide as three transporters had not paid him Rs 20 lakh for fuel they had bought last year. Rampal, the deceased, had been staying in a room built on the premises of the petrol pump for the past several years. His family of three sons and wife lives in Muzaffarnagar. Rampal had been working at the pump for the past 20 years. On Saturday, when Rampal did not come out of his room till late, a few of his colleagues peeped inside and found his body hanging from the ceiling. Police were informed and the body was subsequently sent for an autopsy. In the note, he claimed the three transporters had not paid him Rs 20 lakh after buying fuel around a year ago. The three had allegedly threatened to kill him if he prodded them too much. The note mentions Somveer Tomar, his brother Pramod and a third relative. SP (city) Manish Kumar Mishra said police were yet to receive any written complaint so far. An FIR would be registered on the basis of the complaint, he said. Sources said the two transporters were believed to have been associated with a mainstream political party and had bought fuel around a year ago on credit. The manager was under extreme pressure on how to recover the money, police said. But police denied any knowledge about any political link. Rampal’s son Manoj said his father had never told anyone in the family about the alleged threats or problems he was facing. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Retired colonel, kin duped of Rs 28.8 lakh","LUCKNOW: A retired army officer lodged a case against a real estate company director and three others accusing them of duping him, his wife and daughter of Rs 28.80 lakh on the promise of selling them plots. Colonel Rajveer Singh Sangwan of Sector I, LDA colony, complained to Hazratganj police saying he, his wife Usha and daughter Nimisha had signed a deal with company's director Paresh Rastogi, his kin Piyush and Pankaj for plots in Kasimpur Viruha village in Mohanlalganj in 2013. ""The accused showed us project map and claimed it was approved by government. They took us to the site, showed the plots after which we agreed and paid through cheques. They made us sign an agreement saying they would develop the land and give us plots in 30 months or else would pay Rs 50.99 lakh (for three plots),"" said Sangwan. ""Nearly 75 months have passed. When we verified, we found the company did not own the land shown to us. When we asked them to return the cash, they warned us of serious consequences and even issued life threats,"" Sangwan said in complaint. ""The company duped us of a huge sum which I had saved,"" he said. SHO Hazratganj, Radha Raman Singh said an FIR has been registered against Paresh, Piyush and Pankaj under the charges of criminal breach of trust and dishonesty. "
Lucknow,Burning trash mounds mock CM Yogi Adityanath's directive,"LUCKNOW: An order from the chief minister to stop burning garbage notwithstanding, the practice - a major cause of air pollution - is continuing unabated in the state capital. The district administration and Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), acting on the directive, had asked officials of all the eight zones in the city to conduct routine inspections to stem the problem. Zonal officials and those in charge of beats were warned of punitive measures if they failed to implement the order. However, burning garbage is still common in areas like Lalbagh, Latouche Road, New Hyderabad, Kaiserbagh and Daliganj, where residents complained to TOI about breathing distress, nasal congestion and headache. In Lalbagh, sanitation workers burn mounds of trash on the roadside, making children cough their way to school. ""Our morning begins with breathing heavily polluted air. Garbage burning is rampant. There is no one to stop the sweepers from doing so. School-going children are inhaling poison every day,"" said resident Akansha Singh. As if toxic smoke from garbage were not enough, residents of Latouche Road rued that wires and cycle tubes were also frequently burnt. ""The area is dotted with electronics and cycle repair shops. They junk everything on the road and the same is burnt by sweepers in the morning. It is a health emergency for senior citizens with low immunity and lung function,"" said Gautam Balamurli. Residents of Kaiserbagh are livid because complaints to the LMC about garbage burning have fallen on deaf ears. ""Garbage mounds are set on fire at least three times a week. Thick, black smoke engulfs the neighbourhood. Every second person is complaining of headache or nasal congestion, but the LMC doesn't care,"" fumed Bhavna Tiwari. Civic officials insisted that the LMC had prohibited burning of garbage three years ago. It had also decided to penalise sanitation workers with a day's wage cut while a fine of Rs 500 was imposed on other offenders (commoners/non-employees). ""We have penalised more than 20 people in and around the city. We are conducting regular drives and garbage burning will stop in the city very soon,"" said an LMC official without mentioning when and how. "
Lucknow,15 cases of fraud in India against 'Bunty-Babli' arrested in London,"LUCKNOW: The husband-wife duo from Delhi arrested in London for a Rs 1.76-crore export fraud in Bulandshahr, UP, were never strangers to lies and deceit it seems.  The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of UP Police has stumbled upon 15 cases registered against Vir Karan Awasthi (51) and Reetika Awasthi (49) across the country. The couple floated their export company, Bush Foods Overseas Private Limited, in 2013 after failing in real estate business. The EOW is inquiring into other possible fraudulent deals pulled off by the firm. There are also reports that the two conned nine banks in India out of a whopping Rs 650 crore . Director-general (EOW) Rajendra Pal Singh told TOI that of the 15 cases of fraud and dishonesty, four were registered in Bulandshahr alone. Two more have been reported in Hapur and one has been registered in Meerut. Outside UP, three cases are registered in Haridwar, two in Punjab and two in Delhi. Yet another case is recorded with EOW (Delhi). In all the 15 FIRs, Vir Karan and Reetika are named accused. Around 40 aides are also named in total. In five of these cases, investigation is pending; in two, chargesheet has been filed; and in three others, a final report was submitted by police of the state concerned.  EOW (UP Police) is awaiting deportation of the couple who was arrested from Mayfair in London on October 9. Vir Karan had fled to London soon after the FIR in Bulandshahr in 2015. Reetika joined him in 2016 after the Supreme Court allowed her to travel abroad, purportedly for medical treatment, for a surety bond of Rs 86 lakh. She never returned, prompting the EOW to approach Interpol for a red notice. "

Ghaziabad,Delhi's AQI in severe category despite mild showers,"NEW DELHI: Even mild showers failed to bring respite from the deteriorating quality of air in Delhi/NCR on Sunday morning as the AQI remained in ""severe"" category (401-500) in several areas of the city. At 9 AM on Sunday, the PM2.5 AQI was 499 in Delhi. The air quality hovered near the ""severe plus"" (Above 500) category for the entire night.

According to the Indian Meteorological Department, there will be a possibility of light rain and thunderstorms throughout the city. At AQI of 499, Fatehabad, Hisar air quality worse than Delhi’sThe mild spell has led to a marginal drop in the Air Quality Index (AQI) with readings at different places showing in 'severe category'. As of today morning, the AQI reading at Bawana is at 492, ITO crossing is at 487 and Ashok Vihar is at 482, all in 'severe' category.

Kanpur,"Kanpur air quality improves slightly, AQI dips to 379","KANPUR: The Air quality of the city slightly improved on Saturday as its index value was recorded as 379, placing the city under the 'very poor' category. On Friday, the index value of the air quality was 403 which was categorized in the 'severe' category. According to Nehru Nagar Center, PM 2.5 was around 189 which is slightly above the minimum limit. Similarly, O3 (Ozone) was recorded as 24 against 1 minimum while the NO2 (Nitrogen Oxide) value recorded at 5 pm was high at 63. The value of Sulphur Dioxide, which was recorded as 11, was also twice the minimum limit. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to the center, 189 index value is unhealthy for residents of Kanpur. According to experts, with a decrease in night temperature, which was 16 degrees on Friday night, and increase in humidity, all gases are concentrating at the lower layer of the air and therefore morning time is more dangerous for the morning walkers. Noted environmentalist, Prof Mukesh Sharma, said that the government was not serious in controlling air pollution as it had woken up when the situation reached a critical stage. Sprinkling water over dust would reduce the pollution level, he added. Regional pollution control board officer Franklin, however, claimed that following steps taken by the authorities the air pollution has reduced to some extent and air quality index too improved. The former principal of GSVM medical college Dr. SK Katiyar said, ""As humidity increases in winters and due to cold and humid conditions, all particulate matters (2.5 and 10) concentrate at the lower layer which is harmful to human beings"". A senior doctor SN Shukla suggested that people should increase the intake of water as it acts as a detoxicant and reduces the effect of all foreign materials. ""People should take Vitamin C and B Complex to increase their immunity. Fruits, especially Gooseberry (Amla), is a very good natural source of Vitamin C"", he added. "
Lucknow,Rera authorities may seek powers to attach projects of errant builders,"NEW DELHI: It’s not just homebuyers who are troubled by builders’ non-compliance with orders passed by Real Estate Regulatory Authorities (Reras), even regulators are concerned at the stubborn attitude of builders. Fed up, the regulators are likely to seek more authority under the law to empower them to attach unsold inventories of builders to make them fall in line and find ways to complete projects. Real estate regulators from across states have gathered in Lucknow and sources said they would push for amendments in the Real Estate Regulation and Development Act (Rera) to give them more teeth, particularly to execute orders passed by them. They are also likely to flag emerging issues before the government including financing requirement for the sector, which is saddled with stuck projects across the country. “Our ultimate task is to see that stuck projects get completed and hence we have to look at liquidity issues,” said a regulator. On Sunday, housing secretary Durga Shankar Mishra hinted that the government would consider amendments in the law. “He said government is considering to give more power to regulators so that they can take bold steps,” an official statement by UP Rera said. A couple of Rera chiefs TOI spoke to said though the law had made an impact across states, there were some challenges to take it ahead. They said some legal issues needed to be resolved for effective functioning of regulators. “This is the first time that there is a concerted effort to identify issues, discuss them and make recommendations to the government. The main focus is how to strengthen the system,” one of them said. "
Lucknow,2007 maintenance law finds no takers among Vrindavan’s abandoned mothers,"MATHURA/VRINDAVAN: Abandoned and neglected older women are all too common in the crowded lanes of Vrindavan-Mathura. But oddly enough, none has sought legal redress under the law to protect parents from such shoddy treatment, perhaps indicating just how helpless and vulnerable these women are. Officials said there are no cases before the tribunal in the district under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007 seeking relief by way of maintenance or action against errant children. “The tribunal in Mathura was set-up many years ago but no elderly person has so far filed a case or sought relief under the Maintenance Act,” said district social welfare officer Karunesh Tripathi. Tripathi shared that a mediation facility is available in Mathura too. He claimed authorities in district and in Lucknow have from time to time taken measures to spread the message about the provisions of the law and the redressal it provides. Besides making children accountable to provide maintenance to elderly, the law entails three months imprisonment or a fine of Rs 5,000 or both where it is found that a parent was abandoned by adult children. The ministry of social justice and empowerment is currently reviewing a draft amendment bill that proposes to enhance the jail term to six months and the fine too. Nodal officer for monitoring the shelters for women in distress in Mathura, Anurag Shyam Rastogi, said last year they organised an interaction with the elderly women in one of the government run-shelter homes. “We found most mothers were reluctant to explore the legal route against their children,” Rastogi added. Vrindavan is home to thousands of destitute women and even a growing number of men left to fend for themselves. Many are above 60 and women in their eighties and even nineties can be spotted surviving on charity of pilgrims and trusts that abound here. Though women come from across states, there are many from Mathura and its surroundings too. Elderly women with their heads covered and sandalwood paste smeared on forehead can be spotted lining up to get their Rs 7 to Rs 10 for a few hours of singing in bhajan ashrams. In their hearts most carry painful memories of abandonment, neglect and even abuse by adult children - mostly sons and their wives. However, none of them have chosen the legal recourse to punish their families. Abha Upadhyaya the social protection officer with HelpAge India in Mathura points that most elderly women say they do not want to beg for their rights. “In almost 50% of the cases of elderly women, we find they are either abandoned by family or victims of some kind of emotional or physical abuse. However, these mothers step back refusing to punish their children,” Upadhyaya said. Shyama Devi still shudders at the memory of that day when her daughter-in-law brought her from their comfortable home in Etah, Uttar Pradesh and left her at a privately-run ashram for women in distress – or mostly widows. Over two years later, she has yet to reconcile to the “dhokha” (betrayal) at the hands of her own kin. The women originally came in large numbers from West Bengal but now are from everywhere. TOI came across women from Bihar, Jharkhand, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Assam, Tripura, Punjab, Delhi and even Nepal. Shyama Devi’s story is not a stray case. In the same home, a man came in to leave his mother, Rama Bai. Recently he had taken her home for a few days to Sagar in Madhya Pradesh only to bring her back again. Rama Bai’s file records discord with daughter-in-law. Her son claims he works as a labourer and his wife was paralysed. Whatever be the case, it is clear she fit into the family scheme any more. "
Lucknow,Hospitals see 30% rise in patient footfall as Lucknow gasps for good air,"LUCKNOW: For five days Munshipulia resident Suresh Kumar suffered from breathlessness and chest tightness. It was only after he visited a pulmonologist that the 36-year-old realised that smog was the culprit. “I don’t smoke and never had these problems before. Hence, I was confused. The doctor said pollutants in the air that I inhale on my way to work were to blame. He advised me to wear a mask or take a few days off,” the private company employee told TOI. TimesViewThe anti-pollution measures announced by the administration — ban on burning garbage in the open, suspension of construction activities and sprinkling of water on dusty roads — should ideally have been launched right after Diwali when pollution levels started rising. In its reality check, TOI found that these measures are often not enforced strictly. After announcing such measures, the administration should ensure that they are implemented strictly. The government should collect feedback from the public and take lax officials to task.Kumar is not the only victim of the city’s deteriorating air quality. Hospital OPDs are swamped with people complaining of allergies, skin and eye irritation, breathing distress, chest congestion and cough. Those with underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac ailments are worst sufferers. For five days Munshipulia resident Suresh Kumar suffered from breathlessness and chest tightness.Doctors at KGMU maintained that the number of patients with respiratory problems had jumped 30% in a week. “If we were attending to 250 daily seven days ago, the number is now 325 a day,” said head of respiratory medicine professor Suryakant. The cardiology wing of KGMU is also seeing more patients — 280 a day against 250 earlier. “These are mostly people with weak heart who have acquired respiratory complications,” said associate professor (cardiology) Askhay Pradhan. The patient footfall has similarly gone up at SPM Civil Hospital and Balrampur hospital. Many are complaining of skin rashes and throat infection. A week ago, Indira Gandhi Eye Hospital witnessed 80 patients a day with dry eyes and conjunctivitis. Today, the headcount is higher by 25%. The poison in the air is affecting people irrespective of age. Fourth grader Raj Khare, who has asthma, is experiencing rapid breathing, and chest and neck tightness at least thrice a week. The nine-year-old from Talkatora puts his inhaler into his school bag before books. “We have requested the principal to allow him to skip the morning assembly. Despite wearing a mask, he feels uncomfortable,” mother Anupama said. On Friday, 35-year-old Rubina Khan had to be hospitalised. “I have chronic bronchitis, but the bad air triggered an attack while I was shopping with my daughter,” she said. “Doctors have told us not to allow her outdoors till air quality improves,” said husband Istiyaq Khan. Madiaon resident Ajay Singh had a heart surgery six months ago. “I am working from home because the air outside makes my heart pound faster,” said the 26-year-old employee of a networking company in Aliganj. Anchal of Dubagga, a teacher at a private school who is five months pregnant, said she had been advised to wear a mask. “Pollutants in the air can affect the growth and mental development of my baby.” "

A police team arrested Rakesh Kumar Singh, Bittu Yadav and Pradeep Deo (all from Bihar) from Chinhat and recovered 16 ATM cards, two Aadhaar cards, two PAN cards, a driving license and Rs 21,300 cash from them. A police team arrested Rakesh Kumar Singh, Bittu Yadav and Pradeep Deo (all from Bihar) from Chinhat and recovered 16 ATM cards, two Aadhaar cards, two PAN cards, a driving license and Rs 21,300 cash from them.SSP (STF) Rajeev Mishra said, “After getting information that a gang duping jobseekers was active in Kushinagar and Lucknow, a team zeroed in on the culprits and arrested them. The gang members had duped people not only in India but also Indians living in the US, UK, Australia and Canada.” Explaining the modus operandi of the gang, the SSP said the gang worked on a three-tier system comprising of a scammer, bitcoin vendor and pickers. “The scammer, who is the main handler, roped in bitcoin vendor and pickers and gave them their commission after executing an online fraud. The scammer posted advertisements for jobs asking people to contact him. After an aspirant was trapped, the picker contacted him and asked him to transfer money in a bank account for registration purpose,” the SSP said. He said pickers used to open multiple bank accounts to avoid police scanner and after getting the amount from aspirants, they deducted their commission and transferred the remaining amount to a bitcoin vendor who converted the money in cryptocurrency and transferred it to the scammer’s wallet. According to police, the arrested men were pickers and had disclosed the names of some other pickers active in UP. They have also named a Moradabad-based bitcoin vendor who is on the run. Police said they have got the list of bank accounts and transactions made in them. "
Lucknow,‘Government must empower RERA to revive real estate sector’,"LUCKNOW: The only way the real estate sector will start looking up is if old, pending projects get completed, said Parveen Jain, vice-chairman of the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO). He added that the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, needs to be empowered further to take stronger decisions. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the first RERA conclave in Lucknow, Jain said that despite RERA, people have no confidence in new projects and are investing only in ready to move into units. The Lucknow conclave, he said, should throw up concrete results and firm commitments from the government or else it would be a waste. NAREDCO is an apex real estate body which works under the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. “There are some 5-7 lakh unfinished units and it is imperative that they are delivered before the real estate sector can look up. RERA is toothless in this matter. Among the first things it should be empowered to do is to ensure that as a builder taking on completion of an underconstruction project, one should not be saddled with retrospective liability of that project,” Jain said. Pushing for completion of projects over starting new ones, Jain said that penalising developers for delayed projects should be a secondary concern for the government. He added that current central government schemes for revival of the real estate sector would not achieve much because they are narrow in their outlook. Jain said that as per the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman a fund of Rs 20,000-30,000 crore had been set up to help developers. But, he said, the money was not reaching the end users. “The condition for availing the fund was that projects should not come under nonperforming asset (NPA), but at present most projects fall under this category,” he said. At present, UP has unsold units worth about Rs 1,43,000 crore, of which the UP Housing and Development Board has around 9,500 units. Despite the availability of ready to move into units, Jain said that high levels of unemployment and an uncertainty among the business class is the key reason for slowdown in the sector. “Even now, most of those buying property are looking to invest. However, investors are generally missing from the markets. This, despite the fact, that now is the best time to invest in property due to slowdown,” Jain said. He explained that property rates were at least 30% lesser than they were at peak time in 2012. Add to that an average of 5% inflation each year since then, he said, and one would realise that a good deal could be had at as much as 50% lesser than its actual value. "

With this, the swine flu toll in the city since January rose to six. TimesViewSwine flu reared its ugly head, while Lucknow is barely able to cope with a dengue outbreak. The spread of the two viruses can be contained through efficient planning and coordinated efforts of health department and civic agencies. Had LMC and the department launched fogging drives in a planned manner, the dengue outbreak – now on the verge of breaking the 2016 record – could have been prevented. Swine flu has affected nearly 50 people and claimed one life in the city over the past two months, but the authorities are yet to launch awareness drives or any preventive measures in public places.A woman from Aliganj, Ranjana Pathak (66), detected with H1N1 infection, also died at KGMU on October 19. However, doctors have listed the cause of her death as multi-organ failure due to diabetes, hepatitis C and renal failure. Late hospital reports delayed confirmation of death: CMO Chief medical officer Narendra Agarwal said Kumar was admitted to the isolation ward of the emergency trauma medicine unit of KGMU with breathing difficulties and chest congestion on October 16. He was put on ventilator support on October 19, but did not make it. On why his office took 15 days to confirm the cause of death as swine flu, Agarwal said: “Usually, a death audit is completed in three days, but the hospital records arrived late and then there were (festive) holidays.” Speaking on Pathak’s case, Agarwal said the audit team found that she died of renal failure and hepatitis C complications. “Her brain and heart stopped functioning,” he added. Associate professor of medicine D Himanshu reiterated that Pathak was admitted with respiratory problems and died of multiple complications arising out of failed kidneys and liver. The swine flu season, according to the health department, begins around August and lasts till March. Out of 550 cases this year, 511 were reported in the first season (January-March) and 39 since August. As many as 250 people had tested positive in February, followed by 214 in March. The patient count was much less at 27 in January and 30 in April. "
Lucknow,"Thieves steal gold, cash from temple in Lucknow","LUCKNOW: Unidentified persons broke into a Kali temple in Indiranagar between Saturday night and Sunday morning, and decamped with gold and silver jewellery of the goddess, besides Rs 40,000 in cash. According to the FIR lodged by office-bearers of Ma Kalyani Kalibari in Khurramnagar, the intruders broke two locks to the grille gate to gain entry. “They took ornaments that the goddess wore around her neck and took the cash from the donation box,” the complaint said. The theft has angered residents, some of whom claimed police were on patrol in the area on Saturday night and yet couldn’t check the crime. “If a temple is not safe, do you think the house of a common man is?” said Suyash Mishra. Prashant Tewari said thieves had targeted several temples in Indiranagar and other areas of trans-Gomti. “Policing is lax as ever,” he added. Police spokesperson Ashish Diwedi said subinspector Vinod Yadav had been assigned the case. "
Lucknow,Lucknow police fails to challan driver of 'hanging car',"LUCKNOW: A motorist and his friend had a lucky escape when their luxury sedan leaped off the flyover near Janeshwar Mishra Park and got caught in a tree in the small hours of Sunday. What is more bizarre though is that police failed to register a case or even challan Amir Kamal, a property dealer from Gokhale Marg, and his friend Arib Hussain for speeding at a time the Road Safety Month campaign is underway. Gomtinagar SHO Amit Dubey insisted that a case could not be registered because no one filed a complaint. Asked if the duo were drunk and speeding, Dubey said both were gone by the time police reached the scene and hence, nothing could be ascertained. Lawyers, however, maintained that police couldn't afford to be so lenient and nonchalant in cases of reckless driving. Senior advocate Nitin Mathur said the facts that the sedan jumped a flyover and landed on a tree were indicative of speeding. ""Even if no one lodged a case or no commuter suffered injuries, police are bound to challan the driver. The action would have been a deterrent for all motorists,"" he said. Criminal lawyer Alok Singh agreed that the onus was on police because the car could have run over a passer-by. ""Cops should have conducted a technical inspection of the vehicle first and then lodged a case based on the report,"" Singh said, adding that medical examination of the driver could have revealed if he were under the influence of alcohol, which is a bigger offence.

Lucknow,Lucknow: 'Breathing PM2.5 for a year may cause lung cancer',"LUCKNOW: It is no secret that prolonged exposure to particle pollution and toxic fumes can cause a host of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Experts have now stepped up their warning to say that only a year of continuous inhaling of the microscopic and lethal pollutants can lead to lung cancer, besides increasing chances of a heart attack. Currently, superfine particulate matter PM2.5 is nearly seven times higher than the permissible limit of 60 microgram per cubic metre of air. Track the pollution level in your city ""These particles are so small that they can penetrate deep into our lungs and constant exposure for just about a year may lead to lung cancer,"" said head of respiratory medicine at KGMU professor Suryakant. The professor explained that PM2.5, which has an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 micron, can even enter the blood stream by penetrating the lung membrane, thereby increasing chances of a heart attack by exerting pressure on arteries. ""The PM 10 is less hazardous than PM 2.5, but causes respiratory tract infections and asthma,"" he added. Associate professor of medicine at KGMU D Himanshu said nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) present in air caused skin allergies and eye irritation. ""These gases produce acid after reacting with moisture present in the atmosphere, which in turn burns the skin,"" Himanshu said, adding that inhalation of ozone damaged the nervous system. Dust particles, on the other hand, triggered dryness in the eyes. ""An increased level of NO2 and SO2 can also lead to conjunctivitis and bacterial infections,"" warned ophthalmologist Dr Siddharth Srivastava. "

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Principal booked for student’s death in 2017,"GHAZIABAD: The principal of Vidyavati Mukand Lal Girls’ College, two students and a hostel warden have been booked for murder and criminal conspiracy in connection with the death of a 20-year-old BCA student in her hostel room in 2017. A case was registered at Sihani Gate police station on Friday following a directive by a local court on October 21. College principal Indrani, two of the BCA student’s roommates then — Swati Panwar and Isha — and a hostel warden have been named as accused in the complaint. Pushpanjali Chaudhary was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her hostel room on September 7, 2017. A note, purportedly written by Pushpanjali, mentioned that she did not want to be a burden on her poor family. However, Parvinder Kumar Nagar, who represented Pushpanjali’s father in court, contended that the writing on the note matched that of one of the roommates. BL Chaudhary, Pushpanjali’s father, had approached police, suspecting that her roommates may have had a role in the death. But the cops apparently refused to register an FIR, which prompted him to move court. Chaudhary, a resident of Noida Sector 93 and an auto-rickshaw driver, said he had received a call from her daughter a few hours before her death and she sounded quite happy. “She told me she would come home a couple of days later. Around noon, I got a call from the college management and was told that Pushpanjali was very sick. My wife and I reached the college, but was told to rush to MMG District Hospital as Pushpanjali had died,” he wrote. “The principal told us my daughter had committed suicide. When I reached her hostel room, we noticed that the ceiling was quite high and nobody could reach it without a ladder. A note was also shown to us, but the writing on it was not my daughter’s,” he added. Principal Indrani refuted the allegations. She said Pushpanjali had shut the door of her room after telling her friends that she was going to change her clothes. “When she did not come out after some time, her friends started knocking on the door. They did not get any response. Some students broke open the door and found Pushpanjali hanging from the ceiling. By then, I had also reached the hostel,” said Indrani. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: 80-plus Hindu professor to host his 50th majlis this year,"LUCKNOW: When professor PS Gupta began teaching chemistry at Shia PG College more than half a century ago, it was not just his teaching skills that were noticed and praised by students and colleagues. The professor held a majlis (religious congregation) on the campus in 1970 and earned the sobriquet 'Majlis-wale Guptaji'. The tradition has been continuing ever since. An octogenarian today, the retired teacher holds on to his special title by organising the college majlis, where the tragedy of Karbala is recalled with pathos on the eve of the last day of Muharram every year. He may be old and frail, but the sermons he organises about the martyrs keep people riveted to their seats. This year, the majlis will be held on Tuesday, November 5. ""I had faith in Imam Husain (Prophet Muhammad's grandson). Shia Muslims and Hindus have a lot of cultural similarities, which is why I was drawn to the history of Karbala. I wanted to organise a majlis and when I ran the idea by my colleagues at college, they were more than happy to hear it,"" said the resident of Rajajipuram. ""I made all arrangements for the majlis - from getting the sound system to readying the campus for the solemn event. It was well-attended the first time and many people come even today. They adore me as Majlis-wale Guptaji,"" he added. For a few years now, Gupta's eldest son has been sharing the majlis responsibility with his ageing father. The congregation, which was initially presided over by Limca record-holding cleric Maulana Mirza Mohammar Athar, was later taken over by his brother Maulana Mirza Mohammad Ashfaq. For the past couple of years, Maulana Athar's son Maulana Mirza Yasoob Abbas has been delivering the sermon at the majlis. ""I remember my father telling us that professor Gupta popped the idea (about he organising a majlis) in the staff room one day and everyone agreed. Thus began a tradition,"" said Maulana Yasoob Abbas. ""There was one time when Diwali and the last day of Muharram fell on the same day. The professor gave the solemn ceremony priority over Diwali celebrations at home, which he attended after the sermon,"" recalled the cleric. Posters, banners and pamphlets for the majlis continue to be printed in the name of professor Gupta till date. A few of his Hindu friends answer his clarion call to attend the congregation as well.

Lucknow,I don’t see myself playing a naag or a bhoot: Iqbal Khan,"Even though he has been to Lucknow several times earlier, this time it was different for actor Iqbal Khan. The 'Fun2shh... Dudes in the 10th Century' fame actor was in the city to shoot for the film 'Indoo Ki Jawani' which features Kiara Advani and Aditya Seal. Iqbal, who has also been seen in the show Tumhari Pakhi, says he always tries to explore the city in whatever time he gets from his late nights shoots. Taking time out for us, Iqbal talked about his favourite food in Lucknow, his absence from TV serials, trends on TV and a lot more. You have been to Lucknow earlier also to promote your TV shows, but this time you are shooting for film here. How does it feel?I think that last time I came to Lucknow was several years ago to promote my TV show Tumhari Paakhi. It must be some five years back. I wasn’t able to explore the city at all then but this time while shooting for Indoo Ki Jawani and staying in Lucknow for almost half a month, I was able to see quite a bit of Lucknow though there is still so much left to explore about this city. However, this time although I am staying here for such a long time, I wasn’t able to know the pulse of the city. I was shooting for my scenes till late in the night till early morning. But yes, I went to Dadamiyan ki Mazar, which was a really serene place. I spent time there with the kids of the near-by place and it was really a well-spent evening. Also, I was really happy to see that the metro has finally paved its way in Lucknow. So what all did you explore in Lucknow?My connect with Lucknow is primarily with the food. I have this school friend of mine Ishanveer who is from Lucknow. He had taken me to this very regular looking place in old Lucknow and he made me eat Nihari there with sheermaal. Being a complete foodie, that is my major connect with Lucknow. Lucknow mein jaise nihari milte hai waise kahin bhi nahi taste kari. The whole taste, the tenderness of the meat and the sheermaal in Lucknow is very different from the ones served anywhere in India. When you talk about sheermaal, everywhere in India where I have eaten it, it is same from both the sides. But Lucknow mein aise bilkul nahi tha.Yahan pe sheermaal ek side se tandoori tha and doosri side se ekdum roti type ka tha. I found it amazing! Iqbal Khan at the Gomti River Front (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Iqbal Khan at the Gomti River Front (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) We haven’t seen you much on television these days?There is a phase which television is going through where the makers have not been experimenting much with good content. Even if they have experimented with something, it has gone wrong. Most of the broadcasters today think that Indian audience needs spoon feeding of concepts like daayans, bhoots and makkhis. But the best part is that even today top shows on television are neither mythological or folklore stories. They are regular family dramas. Never say never but I somehow don’t see myself playing a naag or a bhoot. I have not done any such kind of stuff before and God has been really kind to me that I have got shows which have not been typical drama types shows that we have on the small screen today. Television has seen it best phase when shows like Shanti, Hum Log, Kyunki... were made. People used to start watching TV from 8 pm and sit till midnight. But ab kahan aisa hota hai. What about mythological or historical shows, are you not open to them as well?Well, to be frank, I was offered to play Lord Shiva and I did my homework for that and I was excited to play one but at the last minute I didn’t do it for the only reason that such shows require a lot of time even in the making. But TV today, after a month or so, it doesn’t give you that much of time for such a show. I feel on television, even today, romance, relationships, family these things always work. There are so many good shows which are approved for their uniqueness but by the time they go on air woh ek dum badal chuke hote hain and mostly for the worst. Is it the reason, why you have been blamed for a show’s shut down after you left being unsatisfied because of its storyline? It is very easy for the makers to say that actor chala gaya iss wajah se show band ho gaya. I don’t believe television actors have that kind of power. There are so many shows which have worked wonderfully even after the main lead’s exit. So yes I was blamed for leaving two of my shows after I was not satisfied with the storyline, which was not what was originally narrated and promised to me. But I have done a show like Karam Apna Apna long time back which I left after sometime, but even after that it worked for two years. So it is because the story was going downhill that the show couldn’t garner TRPs, not because I left it. "

Track the pollution level in your cityThe study comes at a time when UP government has booked 158 farmers for burning paddy straw, in violation of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) norms. It also comes at a time when Yogi government has asked its prabhari mantris (ministers in charge of districts) to visit around and photo-bomb farms where residue burning is taking place and share the pictures with nodal officers of agriculture department or district magistrates. The report has found that UP recorded 1,428 incidents of stubble burning in the paddy harvest season in October that coincides with Diwali festivities as compared to 2,649 incidents for the corresponding month in 2018. Haryana and Punjab were worse than UP during the same duration. The study, which has been done by Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem, Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratories Division of Agricultural Physics, ICAR, has said that Punjab reported 18.5% increase with 22,421 firing incidents as compared to 18,922 such incidents in 2019 Haryana was a shade better than Punjab but recorded a minor increase of 2.6 % stubble fires at 4,186 as compared to 4,294 incidents in 2018. The UP government officials have formed a CMO WhatsApp group, where each visiting IAS and prabhari minister has been asked to take photographs of the violating farmer whose field is on fire and share that on WhatsApp goup. “Total 488 notices under the Air and Pollution Control Act of 1981 have been slapped on farmers across 11 UP districts. While 158 FIRs have been registered, overall 150 farmers have been booked and the chargesheet will be submitted in the court of law,” said a UP agriculture department official.

And I use decomposer with cow urine to take care of stubble burning. I have been suggesting farmers in UP during my visits to practice the same and the results are fewer number of fire incidents,” a farmer said. The UP government has also been running a programme called Million Farmer School since 2017 where each farmer from a village is asked to attend an educational institution on farming for a six-hour class along with ‘Vaigyani ki baat, kisaano ke saath’ monthly events where agriculture scientists hold talks with farmers.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Poor roads still a worry; water sprinkling plan fails to take off,"LUCKNOW: Civic agencies have so far failed to implement the state government’s order to sprinkle water on broken roads to prevent dust from polluting the atmosphere. Track the pollution level in your cityThe government had directed Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) and UP Public Works Department (UPPWD) to repair all roads by October 31. However, both have missed the deadline and now a ban has been enforced on repair and construction of roads in view of rising air pollution. According to a survey by Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), dust raised from broken roads contributed around 87% to total air pollution in the city. Hence, orders were issued to sprinklewater on broken roads to settle the dust. A TOI reality check found that water sprinkling has been limited to main roads and posh areas. There are many internal roads where residents complained that no water sprinkling has been done. Some prominent areas like Gomtinagar, Jankipuram, Jankipuram Extension, Hazratganj, Lajpatnagar and Mahanagar have tattered roads and residents have been complaining about respiratory, skin and eye problems due to dust which enters their homes and settles in layers. The road from Kisan Bazar in Vibhuti Khand to Vinay Khand is full of potholes. “I have dust allergy and cannot cross this stretch without a mask. Even after that, I have breathing trouble and irritation in eyes,” said Kapil Verma of Vibhuti Khand. Several roads in Jankipuram are also full of potholes and both locals and commuters complain about dust causing problems. Kartik Srivastava of sector C said, “Dust regularly enters our house. I am worried about its impact on my children’s health. I have purchased dust masks but they are not enough.” "
Lucknow,Lucknow pollution: Shortage of masks hits fight against toxic air,"LUCKNOW: Shrouded in toxic haze, the city is bearing the brunt of acute shortage of anti-pollution masks N95 and N90 which can filter 90-95% of pollutants in the air. Left high and dry, people are forced to buy ordinary masks which cannot filter PM10 and PM 2.5, the deadly superfine particles whose concentration has been found to be very high in the city air. Track the pollution level in your cityMedical stores in Chowk, Hazratganj, Lalbagh, Kaiserbagh and Aminabad have already exhausted their stock and distributors said the fresh supply is expected only after few days. Veeru Pajapati, a bronchitis patient, has been shuttling between medical stores in search of N95 mask but in vain. “I have been experiencing chest discomfort and shortness of breath... Despite running from pillar to post, I have not found a single N95 mask,” Prajapati said. The demand for air filtration masks has gone up, said Vikash Amal Sinha, a Lalbagh-based distributor. “We sold only 250 masks of N95 and N90 a day last week. Now, there is a jump of 50% in demand.” He said: “The supply has been affected since most of the companies are in Delhi, where air pollution has reached its hazardous level... Since the demand for anti-pollution masks has hit the roof in the national capital, companies are giving priority to local distributors.” Ravi Bharti, a medical store owner in Hazratganj, said: “We have sold 60 pieces of N90 masks in just three days. Our order for 200 more masks may take at least a week to arrive.” “We had a stock of 400 pieces as demand remains low throughout the year since they cost about three times more than reusable anti-dust masks. But in the past three days, all masks have been sold off,” said Yatin Malik, a distributor in Aminabad. Unable to find them in stores, people have started buying these masks online. “Since my father is asthmatic, we ordered it online after we failed to get it from local medical stores,” Nikhil Singh, a resident of Hazratganj.

Lucknow,A November morning in Lucknow with January-like feel,"LUCKNOW: November morning on Monday appeared like that of January, when dense smog enveloped the city, leading to drop in visibility to around 100 metres. The situation, however, may slightly improve in the coming days with the state weather office predicting rise in wind velocity from Thursday. Usually dense fog engulfs city towards December end and in January. But, for the past five days, Lucknow has been witnessing shallow fog in the morning due to low temperatures. The fog turns into dense smog after combing with pollutants. State met director JP Gupta said that conditions are becoming favourable for change in the wind pattern in the state from moisture laden westerlies blowing at present to dry north-westerly from Thursday.  The wind speed is also expected to rise above 15km per hour, helping in diluting the density of smog by dispersing pollutants. But till then shallow to moderate fog is expected in the morning hours and night, with maximum and minimum temperatures expected to be around 29-31 and 18-20 degrees Celsius, respectively. "
Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh beats slowdown, springs hope for real estate sector","LUCKNOW: The stock of unsold inventory in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad has come down by 26% since the third quarter of 2017 despite slowdown, according to a report released by ANAROCK and NAREDCO during the first national RERA conclave in Lucknow on Monday. In sharp contrast, Gurugram’s unsold inventory went up by 7% and that of Delhi by 20%. The report titled ‘Addressing Challenges and Progressing Ahead in Real Estate’ says that from 1,31,150 units in the third quarter of 2017, the combined inventory of these three NCR cities has come down to 97,270 in the third quarter of 2019. The highest pending stock was disposed of in Greater Noida where the unsold inventory figures fell by 27% from 66,570 units to 48,350 units. During the same period, unsold stock came down by 24% in Noida and Ghaziabad. There are 19,480 unsold units in Noida and 29,440 units in Ghaziabad. The report says the sale of these units was made possible despite slowdown due to restrictions imposed on the launch of new projects in these areas. Giving a comparison with other areas where new constructions continued unabated, the report states that unsold housing inventory went up by about 7% in Gurugram which has the highest stock of unsold units at 55,900, up from 52,460 in 2017-end. Delhi’s inventory also went up by 20% during this period, from 10,770 units to 12,960. Chairman of ANAROCK Property Consultants Anuj Puri said, “UP cities falling in NCR managed to reduce their stock by restricting launch of new projects and focusing on completion of pending ones. In Gurugram, over 2,030 units were launched in the third quarter of 2019 while only 1,610 units were collectively started in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. Two years back as well, Gurugram saw supply of 3,520 new units while these three cities launched just 1,220 units in the same quarter.” The report praises the UP government for ensuring that RERA rules favour aggrieved homebuyers, particularly in Noida and Greater Noida. It adds that RERA policies have been diluted in other states. “Nearly 76% of total 17,077 complaints filed with UP RERA till September 2019 relate to promoters and projects in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. However, UP RERA has disposed of more cases (over 10,000) since its inception than any other state with active RERA rules in place,” the report says. According to the report, another reason for the slowdown in real estate sector is that the residential units are now accounting for 84% of total inventory against 16% of commercial units. “Builders have been making the wrong product. While they are focusing on luxury and high-end projects, the demand is actually for lower income groups and economically weaker sections,” the report adds. "

Lucknow,Centre to launch e-comm portal for realty trade soon,"LUCKNOW: The Centre will start an e-commerce portal that brings the national real estate industry on a single platform, Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday. The portal will be an aggregator, aimed at organising an industry that is massive but also region-oriented. It will bring together inventory, rates and resources across India on a common site. Puri was speaking at the first national Rera conclave, an event that in itself marked significant progress in turning real estate into an organised industry overseen by the watchdog, Rera, which was formed in 2016. Puri said the conclave would be turned into an annual event. The host, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, hinted at likely financial sops for developers in the state in the near future. Noida, one of the most fertile grounds for the industry in the country, is also currently among its biggest troublespots, with realtors going bankrupt and thousands of flats running up to a decade or more behind schedule, symbolised by the Jaypee and Amrapali crisis. “We will make an announcement in a week, which will reinstate the trust of buyers and builders back in the industry,” the CM announced, adding over one lakh flats in Noida and Greater Noida had been handed over since he took over as CM.

The minister’s statement came on a day when UPPCL chairman Alok Kumar, who also heads the trust, proposed at an emergency meeting of the UPPCL board of directors that the corporation meet the shortfall in paying the PF and gratuity to the retiring employees. Over Rs 4,000 crore has been invested by the trust in DHFL. While less than 50% of this amount has been recovered, a whopping Rs 2,268 crore is still with DHFL. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Couple held for killing tenant, burying his body in basement","GHAZIABAD: The owner of a house accused of killing his 30-year-old tenant and burying the body 6ft under the basement last month was arrested along with his wife and daughter from Sahibabad railway station on Monday. Police said Munna Kumar and his wife Sulekha murdered Pankaj, a 30-year-old law student staying in their house for the past few months, because he was in a relationship with their daughter Ankita. Munna allegedly brainwashed 19-year-old Ankita to believe that Pankaj was cheating on her and included her in the plan to murder the tenant. Apart from studying law, Pankaj ran a cybercafe in the area and gave tuitions to local children. Police sources said that in April this year, Munna had admitted his four children in Pankaj’s coaching centre. Pankaj and Ankita had apparently developed a liking for each other between May and June, when her parents had gone to their hometown in Bihar’s Nalanda. The two started talking over the phone and meeting each other. A few weeks later, Pankaj took a room on rent in Munna’s three-storey house. One day, sources said, Munna caught his daughter talking to Pankaj over the phone, and things started to turn sour since then. Pankaj was asked to vacate the room on the pretext that it would be sold off. Circle officer (Sahibabad) RK Mishra said, “Munna raised questions on Pankaj’s character and persuaded Anikta into believing that he was cheating on her. He told his daughter that the law student had lied to her about his age and showed her fake documents. After a while, Ankita believed her father and became a part of his plan.” On October 9, Ankita allegedly lured Pankaj to her house, saying she was alone and her parents had left for some work. “However, her parents were hiding inside the bathroom. When Pankaj reached the house around 10 am, Ankita and her parents smothered him to death, buried the body under the basement and plastered the floor with cement. At that time, Mukesh’s three other children were in school,” Mishra added. Pankaj’s family is from Ballia. His father Narender Singh said he had last spoken to his son on October 8. When Pankaj was reported missing, his father suspected Munna of murdering his son, and it was only after he insisted that the cops agreed to dig a portion of the cemented floor that “looked different”. On October 14, police were finally able to dig out Pankaj’s decomposed body from the basement. On a complaint by Narender, an FIR was lodged against the entire family of Munna, including his four children, under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. The accused had been absconding since then. After fleeing Sahibabad, Munna stayed with her sister-in-law in Patna for some time, police said. They planned to go to Nalanda, his hometown, but went to a friend’s house instead. Later, they hid in Delhi’s Ghazipur for a few days. On Monday, the three were caught from Sahibabad railway station when they were trying to flee the city again. Narender had earlier alleged that Munna wanted to buy the cyber café that Pankaj ran in the area and murdered his son as he refused to sell it to the landlord. "
Ghaziabad,6 bullets fired as two groups clash in society,"GHAZIABAD: As many as six bullets were fired in a clash between two groups of residents of a high-rise apartment in Raj Nagar Extension on Saturday evening. The two groups later filed counter-FIRs against each other. The clash took place around 7 pm on Saturday at River Heights society. One of the FIRs was registered on a complaint by Subodh Tyagi, president of the Apartment Owners’ Association (AOA), against a resident, Sunil Kumar, under sections 307 (attempt to murder) 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. Tyagi alleged that Kumar had been abusing and intimidating RWA members and guards for a long time. The AOA chief said Kumar had clashed with the society’s guards on Saturday and even fired gunshots in the air. Subsequently, a call was made to police by one of the guards. Although the reason behind the clash was not immediately clear, Tyagi claimed that Kumar had threatened to file false cases against the RWA members. It was alleged that Kumar had been nursing grudges against the members after losing the society elections last year. He had even tried to disrupt the poll process, the AOA chief claimed. Kumar, on the other hand, filed an FIR against three unidentified persons under IPC sections 352 (assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 392 (robbery) and 506 (criminal intimidation) the same evening. SHO (Sihani Gate) Umesh Bahadur Singh said an investigation had been initiated into the two complaints. "
Lucknow,Lucknow’s present ‘smoggy’; future foggy,"LUCKNOW: If you have schoolgoing children, chances are they inhaled smoke from 45 cigarettes on their way to school and back on Monday. Track the pollution level in your cityThis may sound bizarre but it is true, considering that the city’s air quality crossed into the ‘very severe’ category according to the definition of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Air quality in this category is hazardous for people to breathe in. Concentration of PM2.5 in many localities of the city in the morning hours and Zafternoon—when children go to school and come back home—was between 400 and 591 micrograms per cubic metre of air. According to a research by the University of California, one cigarette means inhaling 22 micrograms PM2.5 per cubic metre of air. Since children were exposed to an average PM2.5 concentration of 500 mcg/cubic metre of air twice in the day, it means they were forced to inhale around 45 cigarettes. The hourly data of poll tion level recorded by CPCB monitoring stations in four localities—Gomtinagar, Lalbagh, Aliganj and Talkatora—showed that PM2.5 concentration varied between 200 and 591mcg/cubic metre of air throughout the day, depending on weather conditions such as wind speed and temperature. The concentration was, on an average, more than eight times the permissible limit of 60 mcg/cubic metre of air, set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Gomtinagar was the worst hit, where PM2.5 level was 591 mcg/cubic metre of air between 12midnight and 1am and then for seven consecutive hours from 3am to 9am. It dropped to 236 mcg around noon but crossed 500 after two hours of relief at 2pm. “My son complained about irritation in eyes and breathlessness the moment he returned home from school in Gomtinagar on a bicycle. We have been reading about pollutions but on Monday, we felt its choking impact,” said Nidhi Pandey, whose son studies in CMS Gomtinagar. In Lalbagh, PM2.5 concentration was 333 mcg/cubic metre of air at noon which gradually rose to 511 at 6am. Thereafter, it swung between 450 and 500 till evening. “Traffic jam during school hours is an everyday affair but on Monday, stuck in Lalbagh, I could not breathe. My son also complained of coughing,” said Amrita Dixit. After picking her son from school, she said she felt pain and heaviness in her chest. Talkatora area, which houses some small-scale industries, saw PM2.5 rising from 276 mcg/cubic metre of air at midnight to 466 12noon and beyond 523.8 by evening. “My morning walks are always pleasant but today after a mere 2km, I felt breathless. While going to office, visibility due to smog reduced all of a sudden around 11.30am,” said Alok Dixit, a banker in Talkatora. Aliganj witnessed comparatively low pollution levels in comparison to other localities. PM2.5 level at midnight was 176 mcg/cubic metre of air but rose to 314 mcg around 8am before dropping by a few points and rising again in the evening. "

Lucknow,"Above 400, Lucknow AQI ‘severe’ for 4 days in a row","LUCKNOW: Moderate winds helped clear the cloak of smog a bit, but the city’s air quality index (AQI) continued to stay above 400 or in ‘severe’ category for the fourth consecutive day and was the second highest in the country on Tuesday. Track the pollution level in your cityHaze followed by smog in the aftermath of Diwali celebrations has been shrouding the city for the past eight days, making breathing difficult for healthy citizens, not to mention the ailing or the elderly. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded an AQI of 416 in Lucknow on Tuesday. Experts explained that though winds cleared the morning sky, the average AQI for 24 hours (5am to 5am) was high because of severe concentration of PM 2.5 on Monday evening and till the small hours of Tuesday. “The air was clearer by (Tuesday) afternoon, thanks to moderate winds and rise in temperature,” said professor Dhruvsen Singh, director of Lucknow University’s weather and pollution monitoring cell. According to CPCB’s real-time monitoring station, Talkatora was the most polluted with a PM 2.5 concentration of 445.05 microgram per cubic metre of air at midnight.

Lucknow,UP: All construction norms up in smoke,"LUCKNOW: As the state capital continues to cough through pollution, some private and government agencies are brazenly flouting the government order to halt all construction activities. A TOI realty check found construction norms being violated in prominent localities like Mahanagar, Aliganj, Niralanagar, Gomtinagar, Jankipuram and Aishbagh. At many under-construction units, building material was not covered with green nets to prevent dust from polluting the air. Track the pollution level in your cityIn view of the deteriorating air quality, the state government had directed the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) to ensure that no construction takes place in the city. However, the LDA has failed to implement the order. In Mahanagar, construction work of a three-storey housing unit was in progress. The contractor, Mahesh Patel claimed to be unaware of any government order. Tarun Verma, a resident of Mahanagar Sec-C, said, “Initially, they didn’t even put a green net to prevent dust from mixing in the air. Since my father has a breathing problem, I took up the issue with the contractor and a small green net was placed. However, it has failed to prevent the dust from coming outside.” Similar situation was found in Aliganj, where locals have been gasping under “eye-burning pollution”. Shikhar Saxena, a resident, said, “Forget about stopping the construction work, the site near my house is not even following the NGT norms. The entire locality gets walloped with dust causing redness in our eyes and breathing problems.” LDA vice-chairman P N Singh said, “We have issued notices to 90 construction sites to stop construction work. Our zonal officials are regular drives to ensure that no construction work takes place in the city till the pollution level improves.” "
Lucknow,"UP: If you’re older than 60 years, take extra pollution cover","LUCKNOW: Ram Manohar Mishra, 78, has been feeling breathless for the past four days, ever since he collected his pension from the bank, barely 2km from his Thakurganj residence. Track the pollution level in your city“My throat burns and I have difficulty breathing even if I go out on the terrace. The doctor says it is severe pollution that is causing my wheezing. I have been advised rest and venturing out is a strict no-no,” the retired government teacher told TOI. Mishra is not the only senior citizen who’s been extra susceptible to the poison in the air. If hospital and clinic registers are any indication, the number of elderly patients has leaped by 50-65% since Diwali. Most have complaints like chest congestion, high blood pressure and aggravation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an umbrella term used to describe progressive lung diseases, including emphysema (damaged lung air sacs), chronic bronchitis, and refractory (non-reversible) asthma. Also, there’s a 35% increase in bacterial infection cases among the elderly, including conjunctivitis and dry eye syndrome. “If we were attending to 50 elderly patients a day eight-nine days ago, the number is now 100,” said head of respiratory medicine at KGMU professor Suryakant. “Around 65% patients have chronic respiratory problems aggravated by high pollution levels,” he added. Chest specialist Kalayan Malik, who runs a private hospital in Thakuraganj, said he was attending to 35-40 elderly patients a day. “The number was 15-20 a week earlier. Only an hour or two of exposure to pollutants is complication underlying ailments,” Malik said. Similarly, at Balrampur Hospital, SPM Civil Hospital and Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, the number of elderly patients in the pulmonary OPD has jumped from around 25 a day to 50. Narhi resident Sarju Prasad, 60, had to be rushed to the emergency after he had an attack of breathlessness on Tuesday afternoon. The COPD patient was at his electrical appliances store when he suddenly ran out of breath. “I was uneasy since morning and had an attack around 3pm. My son took me to hospital, where I received oxygen support,” he said. Harishchanda Singh, 75, of Chapatioan said merely a 30-minute park visit on Friday made his eyes burn. “I went to the ophthalmologist a day after and was told I had conjunctivitis. I have been advised to stay indoors,” he added. "

Lucknow,"Jan Sangh, BJP saved nation from another Partition: CM Yogi Adityanath","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said that the country would have been witness to another Partition if the leaders of Jan Sangh and BJP had not staunchly opposed the appeasement policy of the Congress regimes at the Centre. “Jan Sangh and later the BJP were conceptualised to make Bharat as one country. The two organisations stood for democratic values which bind the country into one nation,” Yogi said at the book launch of ‘Amit Shah and March of BJP’ written by Anirban Ganguly and Shivanad Dwivedi, in Lucknow. “For BJP, the Constitution drafted by BR Ambedkar is more important than any other thing,” the CM said. BJP has reached a turning point under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah, the CM said. Amit Shah started his political career by pasting posters for daughter of Vallabhbhai Patel’s daughter Maniben in Mehsana and went on to become the BJP chief. This is possible only in BJP which does not believe in nepotism,” Yogi said. Comparing Shah with Adi Shankaracharya and Chanakya, the CM said it was the appeasement policy of the Congress that compelled Shah and senior BJP leaders to come up with the concept of ‘Congress-Mukt Bharat’. Yogi said when the Opposition alliance in UP and other states worried some BJP functionaries, Shah told them that the party would beat all odds and register a win. “And that’s exactly what happened in UP, where SP-BSP fought against us, but we emerged victorious in Lok Sabha polls,” he said. Yogi said that even the programmes of Modi were executed by Shah and ensured that the philosophy of `Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’. Quoting PM Narendra Modi, Yogi said that the government should not work for any particular caste or community. “He (Modi) ensured that the people’s welfare schemes were taken down at the grassroots level,” he said. Yogi also blamed the Congress for introducing Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. “Modi and Shah scrapped it because for them the country is more important than politics and every country has backed their decision,” he said.

Lucknow,"Power employees on a short fuse, want PCL chairman to step down","LUCKNOW: Enraged over the alleged Rs 2,200-crore PF scam involving investment of their hard-earned money in tainted Dewan Housing and Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), power employees staged a protest at Shakti Bhawan, the UPPCL headquarters, on Tuesday. Under the aegis of UP Rajgya Vidyut Karamchari Sangharsh Samiti, the protesters demanded that the state government should take the guarantee of the money invested by the UP state power sector employee trust in various unscheduled financial institutions including DHFL, PNB Housing Ltd and LIC Housing Limited. Samiti convener Shailendra Dubey said that UPPCL chairman Alok Kumar, who also happens to be the chairperson of the trust, should own the responsibility of the anomaly and step down. The union also demanded that Kumar be arrested for the alleged scam as he could influence the ongoing inquiry by the economic and offence wing. “More than Rs 3,000 crore was invested in DHFL during the tenure of Kumar and he should be held responsible for this,’’ Dubey said. Angry power employees started gathering at the UPPCL headquarters in the afternoon before taking out a foot march around the two buildings housing the offices of corporation chairman and energy minister Srikant Sharma. Raising slogans against the management, the employees said the state government cannot shy away from its responsibility of ensuring public welfare. The agitation came a day after the government removed UPPCL managing director Aparna U and posted her as secretary in the irrigation department. Employees said that just removal of Aparna U would not assuage the anger of the affected staff. “The entire UPPCL management needs to take responsibility and step down,’’ Union general secretary Rajeev Singh said. Employees wondered as to how the UPPCL could not keep an eye on the investment of their PF in unscheduled financial institutions. “They know about the quantum of payments made to the contractors but they claim of remaining in dark when it comes to investments in companies like DHFL,’’ said an agitator.

Lucknow,"UP: Gang lifts 8 high-end vehicles, but leaves behind super car","LUCKNOW: In a wee-hour operation à la Hollywood action heist film Gone In 60 Seconds, a gang of vehicle thieves stole eight expensive cars valued at more than a crore from a resale showroom on Faizabad Road, opposite Badshahnagar Metro station, on Tuesday. Ironically, the cars were lifted from a place 700 metre from the trans-Gomti ASP’s office and at a time cops were busy checking vehicles at 93 points under Operation Midnight. In a face-saver, police claim to have identified four suspects from surveillance camera footage and are not ruling out an insider role. There were 17 cars parked inside the walled compound, but the gang whisked away six with automatic transmission — a BMW X3, an Audi Q3, a Toyota Fortuner, a Ford Endeavour and two Toyota Innova Crystas — besides two Hyundai i20s that had manual transmission. What is baffling investigators is that the thieves left behind a fleet of other high-end cars. Employee on leave under police scannerWhat is baffling investigators is that the thieves left behind a fleet of other high-end cars, including an Audi Q7, a Mercedes, two more BMWs, a Skoda Superb, a Honda Accord, a Chevrolet Cruze, a Renault SUV and another Fortuner, which were more expensive than the Innova and i20s despite having access to the keys. In fact, they moved the Q7 (ex-showroom price Rs 80 lakh) out of their way to take some of the other cars. According to police, the gang first scaled the 8ft boundary wall to enter the resale showroom premises, and then broke open locks to the main gate and office door. Keys of all the second-hand cars were inside an almirah locker while the almirah key was inside the drawer of the office table. “The intruders took all the keys, but later left behind nine inside the compound. The most expensive car in the lot was an Audi Q7, but they just moved it out of the way to steal the BMW X3 and Endeavour parked behind. The i20s were whisked away first, followed by the Fortuner, Crystas and Q3. The X3 and Endeavour were the last to go,” a policeman said. A 28-year-old employee who has not returned to work since he went home to Varanasi for Diwali is under police scanner. His last location was traced to Chandauli. He had worked at the used car showroom for around three months. Mahanagar circle officer Sonam Kumar said they were examining CCTV camera footage and the break-in seemed to have taken place around 1am. “The gang may have taken multiple routes to reach target,” he maintained. Trans-Gomti ASP Rajesh Srivastava said registration plates of the stolen cars had been put under surveillance. “They have not crossed any toll plaza on the outskirts of Lucknow. We have a list of suspects provided by the business partners. The digital video recorder, initially reported as missing, was found dumped in a duct inside the compound. Footage shows four suspects,” the officer added. "
Lucknow,"Former UPPCL MD arrested in over Rs 2,000 crore PF scam","LUCKNOW: Former managing director of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) AP Mishra was arrested by the economic offences wing (EOW) of UP Police on Tuesday evening in connection with the scam involving investment of over Rs 2,200 crore of the corporation employees’ provident fund in the tainted Dewan Housing and Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL). Mishra has been arrested under the charges of criminal breach of trust, dishonesty, forgery of valuable security, forgery for the purpose of cheating and using a genuine document as a forged one. He has been locked up at the Hazratganj police station. Confirming Mishra’s arrest to TOI, director general of EOW Rajinder Pal Singh said, “The EOW is verifying all the documents seized from the (UPPCL) office of the period when Mishra served as MD. Tampering has been witnessed, which is being cross-checked.” Mishra’s arrest comes two days after general manager (finance) P K Gupta and former director (finance) Sudhanshu Dwivedi were arrested. The state government has already recommended a CBI inquiry into the case. “We will now seek remand of Gupta and Dwivedi, so that they can be confronted with Mishra,” Singh added. The EOW on Sunday began investigating the violation in investment of over Rs 4,000 crore by UP Power Sector Employees’ Trust in DHFL. Of this amount, Rs 2,268 crore has got trapped following a Mumbai high court order restricting the company from releasing money to its creditors. Sleuths from EOW swooped down on Mishra at 3.30amMishra took over the reins of UPPCL as MD in May 2012, soon after SP stormed to power with absolute majority. In fact, he was the first engineering cadre official to become MD of UPPCL and was given extension thrice in the Akhilesh Yadav regime. He tendered his resignation on March 23, 2017, after the BJP came to power. On Tuesday around 3.30am, Lucknow police along with a 10-member team of EOW swooped down on Mishra’s Aliganj residence and picked him up for questioning. He was taken to EOW office and questioned for several hours. Mishra is accused of giving his nod to the investment of employees’ provident fund money in DHFL in March 2017, EOW sources said. They said that it had come to the fore that Mishra was one of the key members of the board of trustees which, on March 22, 2017, gave its assent to invest in companies, including DHFL, from where higher returns were expected. Interestingly, Mishra resigned on March 23 but was issued a transfer order on March 24. Hence, his role in the investment decision could not be ruled out, a senior EOW official told TOI. Even as SP and BJP continued to trade charges over which government was responsible for the diversion of the PF money, BSP chief Mayawati lashed out at the saffron party and said that having failed in stemming corruption, it should not play a blame game. Putting out a tweet, she said: “When BJP was unable to stop the more than Rs 2,200 (sic) PF scam that involved money of thousands of engineers and workers of the power department, what is the point of playing a blame game. The government should first think about the welfare of the workers.” "

A middle-aged tailor in Syedwada, a neighbourhood with a considerable number of Muslim families living alongside temples and Hindu households, said, “They (locals residents) talk among themselves and say that Syedwada will be targeted this time. It is worrisome.” The man, who didn’t want to give out his name, added, “They are saying there will be trouble if the judgment is not in favour of the Ram temple. What will we do in such a situation if not send our families away?” Many in the community had done the same when in November last year VHP and Shiv Sena members descended on the town. Some distance away, Ghanshyam Gupta, whose family has been selling ladoos outside the famous Hanuman Garhi temple for three generations, said, “We have made suitable arrangements and are stocking rice and lentils at home.” Umar Farooq, a litigant in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, said he’s seen it all — the violence in 1990, the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 and the arson that followed, the tension around the high court judgment of 2010, and when the Shiv Sena marched into Ayodhya in November last year. “Through all this, Ayodhya residents never had problems with one another. Trouble starts when a mob comes from outside. That’s when there is chaos for us,” he added. The district administration, meanwhile, is holding peace gatherings with community leaders and is even forming WhatsApp groups for real-time communication and deployment of additional forces in the event of an emergency. District magistrate Anuj K Jha told TOI that a number of meetings in October and November with Hindu mahants and Muslim imams had been held to address worries and give assurances of safety. “We have assured Muslims that a survey of all sensitive areas, including minority-dominant ones and those with mixed populations, has already been done and we will be deploying forces ahead of the verdict. There is no need for people to panic. Our focus is peace and protection in the whole of Ayodhya,” Jha said. However, apprehension is still running deep. In October, the Muslim community’s nervousness became apparent when a meeting was called at the house of Haji Mahboob, another litigant in the dispute, to get their concerns addressed. “Security was beefed up in Ayodhya in 2010 when the high court was to pronounce a judgment. Things will be fine if there is a similar bandobast in place. But people are scared. Many haven’t been able to forget 1992.” He has a point. Syed Khalique Ahmed’s son was to get married in December. But feeling that the situation is “not conducive” for a celebration, Ahmed not just changed the venue of the wedding from Faizabad to Lucknow but also got his son married in early November itself. Hotel owners in Ayodhya echoed Ahmed’s sentiment. Pawan Singh, manager of the Birla Dharmashala, meters away from Hanuman Garhi, said, “People have cancelled bookings for venues and rooms, not just for November and December but until February next year. Whoever is saying normal life in Ayodhya has not been disrupted is not telling the truth.” "
Kanpur,Slowdown signal: Top companies cold to IIT hiring season,"MUMBAI: In yet another indication of the economic slowdown, some of the leading firms that visit the IITs every year are likely to stay away during the placement season starting December. Some of the sought-after ‘Day One’ firms, which typically offer hefty packages, have either declined requests from placement cells of the institutes or are yet to confirm their interest. The placement cells at these institutes have doubled their efforts to reach out to newer firms to get adequate recruiters. Quantitative investment management firm, World-Quant, which usually offers one of the highest domestic packages at over Rs 40 lakh, will be visiting IIT-Bombay but is yet to confirm at other IITs. Tower Research and Graviton Research and other firms with lucrative offers have not given any positive indication yet. At some of the IITs, USbased cloud data management company Rubrik, which offers US profiles to students, has not confirmed its presence this year. “We have lost a few companies which regularly visited us, but we are compensating for this by exploring newer avenues,” a student representative from IIT-Kharagpur said. “Some of them have met their requirements from the pre-placement offers. We have increased the total number of companies visiting us this season to beat the ongoing slowdown.” The first phase of placements across IITs commences on December 1 every year and goes on for two to three weeks. Many IITs have seen a slight increase in their pre-placement offers from the previous year, while some like the ones in Kanpur and Kharagpur have seen almost similar number of offers. In a press statement, IIT-Hyderabad said that the number of PPOs has almost doubled compared to the previous year. Gartner, Graviton, World-Quant, Rubrik are not visiting the IIT-Kanpur campus, while Tower Research is yet to confirm, said a student. “The automobile sector is severely hit,” one of the overall placement co-ordinators from the institute said. “In other core sectors, fewer roles are being offered, but there is no freeze. In some other firms, newer roles are added. We are expecting a marginal drop in the hiring with some of the leading ones staying away from our campus.” An official from the IITBombay placement office confirmed that a few ‘Day One’ organisations had declined to participate in the placement process. At IIT-Bombay, 163 pre-placement offers were made till November 5, compared to 141 last year. A student representative from IIT-Delhi said many firms from the core sectors which visited last year had refused to come this year. "

Kanpur,"Two get 10-year jail term for abducting, exploiting minor","KANPUR: Additional district and sessions judge (V) Sanjay Kumar Verma on Wednesday sentenced accused Ghulam Jilani of Gangaghat and Farhan of Tiwaripur to ten years rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 22,000 on each for enticing, kidnapping and physically exploiting a minor girl. According to additional district government counsel (ADGC) Pradeep Bajai, the court in its order observed that 50% of the fine amount (Rs 22,000) be given to the victim as damages. The ADGC stated that a complaint was filed by the victim’s father on July 14, 2010, against two persons--Ghulam Jilani and Farhan--alleging that they had enticed his daughter and alter kidnapped her at around midnight. The victim in her statement stated that she knew Farhan because he was studying with her in the same school and the same class and she would often help him financially. She told the court that on July 14, 2010, Farhan had asked her to help him and when she went to Farhan, who was standing near a car, Ghulam Jilani dragged her inside the car and placed a medicated handkerchief on her mouth after which she lost her senses. When she regained consciousness, she found herself in Unnao. Later, Farhan took her to Aligarh. She said that was kept in a house where both Farhan and Jilani physically exploited her for two months and used to threaten her. On the point of the sentence, the defence counsel pleaded that Jilani, a 64-year-old man, had not played any role in the incident and Farhan was minor at the time of the commission of the crime. Since he was the only earning member of his family, therefore, the court should take a lenient soft view, he pleaded. Countering the defence counsel's arguments, the prosecution claimed that as the accused had not only kidnapped and physically exploited the girl in a very calculated manner for more than two months, therefore, they deserve exemplary punishment. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)"
Lucknow,"Reconsider Tipu Jayanti ban, HC tells Karnataka govt","BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court on Wednesday directed the BS Yediyurappa government to reconsider its decision to ban the annual celebration of Tipu Jayanti at an administrative level, even as it refused to stay the July 30 government order (GO) cancelling the Jayanti. Hearing a PIL seeking to scrap the GO, a division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka noted that since the issue involved was a policy matter, the court did not want to pass a stay order. Citing the November 8, 2016, order passed by the then Congress government supporting Tipu Jayanti celebrations and the fact that the cancellation order was issued within a day’s time by the present BJP government, the bench directed the state to reconsider the GO. The court gave two months’ time to the government for the same. The court also directed the government to submit information on other birth anniversary celebrations conducted at the government level. Since the advocate general had told the court that others were free to celebrate Tipu Jayanti on November 10, the court directed authorities to take all precautionary measures to ensure law and order. Lucknow-based Bilal Ali Shah who claims to be a descendant of Tipu Sultan, along with Tipu Sultan United Front and Tipu Rashtreeya Seva Sangha challenged this cancellation order. The petitioners argued that the cancellation was discriminatory since 25 other Jayantis were being celebrated in the state. They argued Tipu Jayanti was cancelled because he was a Muslim. The court said the PIL warranted a detailed hearing and posted the matter to January. "
Lucknow,"Ex-UPPCL MD quit on March 23, 2017, ‘signed’ note day later","LUCKNOW: Even as a political row erupted over Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) provident fund investment violations, then UPPCL MD A P Mishra, under whose tenure the decision to invest Rs 2,268 crore in tainted DHFL was taken and the money transferred, is in the eye of the storm on how he sanctioned the investment a day after his resignation during the transition of Samajwadi Party and BJP governments in March 2017. Mishra was arrested on Tuesday. Mishra submitted his resignation on March 23 that year, a day before the UPPCL Trust finally authorised the move to invest in DHFL. But what has baffled the EOW probing the scam is that the minutes of the trust meeting to invest in DHFL was prepared on March 17 and that Mishra’s signature is there on the March 24 meeting note. CM Yogi Adityanath took oath on March 19, blurring the lines on whom to fix responsibility. TOI is in possession of both the communications — Mishra’s resignation letter signed by then UP power additional chief secretary Sanjay Aggarwal as well as the March 24 minutes of the meeting note of UPPCL Trust that resolved to invest in DHFL. The March 24 decision by UPPCL trustees has been signed by five people — then UPPCL chairman Sanjay Aggarwal, trust secretary and general manager (finance and accounts) P K Gupta, director (finance) Sudhanshu Dwivedi, director (accounts) Satya Prakash Pandey and Mishra. “The trustees passed the following resolution: Board of trustees agreed to consider investment proposals as per government notification dated March 2, 2015, in securities with higher security and high interest rates other than term deposits of nationalised banks and ‘Triple A’ rated companies. As per prevailing practice, further investment in securities will be decided by secretary (trust) on case-to-case basis, with the consent/approval of director (finance), UPPCL, and trustees,” said the March 24 note. Sources in EOW though have said they are checking the possibilty of over-writing on one of the meeting notes and that if the March 24 meeting actually took place on March 22. Mishra has been shown as “special invitee’ in the March 24 meeting. TOI is also in possession of the March 17 note in which DHFL is shown to be providing higher rate of interest (ROI) as compared to other nationalised banks and hence the decision to invest Rs 2,268 crore.

Lucknow,"Shia Board’s secret deal: Build temple, shun claim on other disputed shrines","LUCKNOW: With the mediation hotline shut and Ayodhya verdict day drawing closer, TOI accesses a letter by the Shia Waqf Board to the SC-appointed committee led by Justice FMI Kalifulla, offering a secret deal to solve the decades-old dispute. Striking a hard bargain with the mediation panel, Shia Waqf Board chairman Wasim Rizvi while consenting to construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya put a rider that Hindus would have to shun their claims over other disputed shrines all over the country under a 1931 British-era Act. The letter followed discussions in March before Lok Sabha polls. The mediation committee had made a last-ditch attempt to resolve the Ayodhya imbroglio by talking to all stakeholders on directions of the apex court, but failed to hammer out a consensus due to the stringent stand of both Hindu and Muslim representatives, who questioned the integrity of some members and finally decided to abide by the Supreme Court judgment. Rizvi’s letter dated March 26, 2019, in possession with TOI reveals the Shia Waqf Board claimed to be the key litigant and custodian of the disputed property and extended a three-pronged offer. First, the Ram temple can built in the disputed site with consent of all litigants and a Babri mosque won’t be resurrected anywhere in India. Second, Hindus cannot lay claim on any other place of worship in the country and strictly adhere to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1931. Third, it demanded a promise from the mediation panel on “repair, renovation, and beautification of all mosques in Ayodhya at the expense of the state exchequer”. The Shia Board chief played hard ball, unlike his public posturing when he declared the dispute site be handed over to Hindus . "

Even BJP spokespersons have been told to either stay away from TV shows on the Ayodya verdict or play down the emotive issue if they did. Over a dozen scheduled programmes of the VHP-RSS-Bajrang Dal, to be held in November, have been postponed for an indefinite period and thousands of letters and appeals are being issued for peace and harmony. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath called a special meeting of his ministers and asked them to avoid mentioning Ram temple in their discussions. Sharad Sharma, spokesman of VHP in Ayodhya, said all programmes of the Sangh Pariwar have been postponed till an indefinite period and organisations and office-bearers have been told to maintain peace and propagate it through letters, appeals in media and through man-to-man contact by visiting villages and other places. Sharma said that Durga Vahini was to meet in Ayodhya for a training programme, “pracharaks” of various organisations of the RSS were to meet in Haridwar and Varanasi and a similar programme was to be held in Lucknow, but all these have been put off by now.

Lucknow,"Sangh curbs on cadre ahead of Ayodhya verdict: No sweets, crackers on D-day","AYODHYA/LUCKNOW: Ahead of the Ayodhya verdict, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have enforced a slew of curbs on its cadre, including a ban on distribution of sweets even if the judgment is in favour of the temple. Senior RSS and VHP functionaries told TOI there should not be any celebration that can potentially disturb harmony. “Cadres have been told to refrain from distribution of sweets, bursting crackers or taking out processions,” said a senior RSS functionary. The development comes a day after minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi hosted a meeting with Muslim and Hindu representatives and social organisations in Delhi, and appealed for calm after the Supreme Court verdict. The meeting which was attended by senior RSS functionaries, including Krishna Gopal and Ram Lal, called for a consensus on “no celebration or aggression” after the verdict. The hardline Sangh outfit, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, issued an appeal to members to maintain harmony in the run-up to the verdict. VHP vice-president Champat Rai said, “The verdict should not be a trigger for a Hindu-Muslim face-off, but an acceptance of the court verdict.” In a letter issued to VHP workers, Rai said this verdict won’t be any community’s victory. Expecting the verdict to be declared before November 15, he advised the cadre not to create an atmosphere of frenzy. State spokesman of VHP Sharad Sharma said, “All proposed programmes and activities by various outfits ahead of the verdict have been cancelled. Whether the verdict is in favour of Hindus or Muslims, both communities must present an example of harmony and brotherhood now. We all have to take care that no incident strains the cordial relations between Hindus and Muslims,” said Sharma. VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal said cadre and seers may continue their ‘anushtans’ (ritual prayers) for the Ram Temple wherever they are but they should not go overboard. “We are keeping a wait and watch approach. Any course of action would be taken after consultation with seers after the SC verdict is delivered,” he said, while speaking to TOI. VHP camps involving ‘Trishul Diksha Karyakram’ (trident training programmes) are already on hold. The camps were aimed at providing training to around 10,000 cadre and prepare them in case the court verdict comes in favour of the temple. Another VHP functionary in Ayodhya said no call has been given to cadres across India to reach the temple town once the SC verdict is delivered. "
Lucknow,"UP: Banda power staff wear helmets, fearing injury from crumbling roof","LUCKNOW/JHANSI: Fearing injury from the dilapidated ceiling of their office, employees in Banda district office of the UP Power Corporation Limited have started wearing helmets to their workplace. Located in Peeli Kothi area, the part of the building in shambles is the metre reading lab of the electricity department. The move, which was also seen as a protest against the apathy of the authorities towards their pending demand for a repair, caught attention of authorities when pictures of the employees wearing helmets went viral on social media. Soon, officials ordered an immediate repair of the building. However, they said the work would take about a week. “Our request for repair is pending since June 2017. Skipping office is not an option so we decided to take precautions,” said one of the employees. The photographs of the office speak volumes about the poor working condition. Remains of the rotting wooden false ceiling hangs over their head along with electrical wires. “The damp walls in the office have developed fungus... In monsoon, water droplets also trickle down from them,” rued another employee. One of the employees shared that a couple of months ago, a female visitor had a miraculous escape. “A huge chunk of the false ceiling fell upon her along with some debris.

Air in both cities was in the “very poor” category on Tuesday. Track the pollution level in your cityOn Wednesday, Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 294, also in the “poor” category. On Tuesday, the AQI was 346 (very poor). Officials said all existing GRAP restrictions continue to be in place and the the regional office of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has sent out an alert saying that there should be no leaf burning at any place. The UPPCB has directed Noida and Greater Noida authorities to be vigilant of horticulture waste. “We ask all the authorities to collect horticulture waste and send them for composting. At no cost should leaves be set on fire. Every year around this time when trees shed leaves, people start setting them on fire. But we do not want any such reports this year,” said Anil Singh, the regional officer, UPPCB, Noida. Leaves are usually removed from the streets during sweeping by civic workers and then dumped in secluded spots. Horticulture waste can be seen along the approach road to Okhla bird sanctuary and many other spots and after some time, they are set on fire. “Burning of leaves and horticulture waste is punishable under National Green Tribunal (NGT) norms. Besides, we are going to keep a vigil on all leaves being picked up and piled up at various spots across the city. Burning leaves can lead to emission of toxic gases and we want to prevent it,” Singh said. He added that the air quality has improved overnight with a change in wind direction and speed. “In addition, with the clouds shifting, there has also been sunlight that has helped in dispersing the pollutants,” he said. On Wednesday, Noida and Greater Noida mostly saw clear sky. But Thursday might be a hazy day, as temperatures are likely to decrease overnight.

Ghaziabad,"Hindon gets 2nd flight, most seats sold for the week","GHAZIABAD: “Mundgod to Hubballi by road, on to Hyderabad, a flight to Delhi and then an overnight bus to Dharamsala,” Lobshany Gyaltsan, a Buddhist monk, went over the route he used to take to get to the hill town where the Dalai Lama lives. Starting Wednesday, things will be simple: “One flight to Hindon and a bus ride to Dharamsala,” he said. What used to be a journey spanning at least three days will now take just a day. It has been nearly nine months since Hindon airport was launched. The idea was to take some pressure off Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Hindon airport started functioning last month, when Heritage Airlines started a six-day flight service to Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand. But that ended up being a false start after flight operations were suspended twice. After a hiatus, the Hindon display board lit up again on Wednesday: “OG115”. For now, the new Star Air flights to and from Hubballi will be the only one operating out of the airport. Just as the display board said the incoming flight was on time, the terminal broke out in a flurry of activity – officials from Star Air and the Airports Authority of India wrapped up a quick inaugural ceremony. At 3.45pm, the first flight on the route touched down at Hindon. “I will be seeing my husband after many months. But more than me, it is my three-year-old whose excitement knows no bounds,” said Nisha, who came to Hindon from Nagina, more than 150 km away, as she waited in line for baggage check. The Heritage Airlines flight, a nine-seater, did not allow any check-in baggage. Star Air does. And on the first day, there were no glitches. Lobshany, meanwhile, waited with 30 other monks, all on their way back to their monastery at Mundgod, about 50 km from Hubballi in Karnataka. “Return journeys were tiring as well. We would take a flight to Mumbai, Goa or Bengaluru and then travel by road,” said Geshelopsangh Tseten, another monk who was part of the contingent. In fact, a lot of what the Star Air flight service has to offer makes things easier – a bigger aircraft (the 50-seater Embraer), a bigger fleet (two now, to be scaled up to five by the end of the year) and baggage check-in facilities. “I have to commute to Hubballi at least once a month. I will be spared the rush of the Delhi airport and can save a lot of time,” said Sarvesh Choudhary, a project engineer with a Karnataka-based MNC. The response has been good, the airline said. “We are booked right through the week,” said Simran Singh Tiwana, CEO of Star Air. But could it run into the same problems that Heritage did? “We will not face the same snags. We are already operating on seven routes in the country. Our performance has been on a par with the major players and, unlike Heritage, we have two planes in the fleet and we intend to add three more by the end of the financial year.” The Hubballi-Hindon flights will operate thrice a week – on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. On Wednesday and Thursday, the flight will leave Hubballi at 1.05pm and land in Hindon at 3.45pm. It will leave for a return journey to Hubballi at 4.10pm and reach at 6.50pm. On Saturdays, the flight will leave Hubballi at 11.50am and arrive at 2.30pm. It will leave Hindon at 3pm and reach Hubballi at 5.40pm. "

Lucknow,Lucknow Mahotsav to be postponed again this year?,"The much-awaited annual event Lucknow Mahotsav, that is held from November 25 to December 5 in the city, may be postponed this year. In anticipation of the effect of the Ayodhya case verdict, considering the law and order situation, the administration is mulling over postponing the Mahotsav this year to next year in January. Two years ago too the Mahotsav had been postponed to January in view of the Civic polls held in the state, despite it being a calendar event. This year too, the mega-fair may be postponed to January to avoid any untoward incident during the ten-day festival in view of the law and order situation that prevails after the Ayodhya Ram Temple case verdict is out. The Lucknow Mahotsav, which is a 10-day carnival like event, also has celebrity performances every day apart from mushaira, kavi sammelan, vintage car rally, kite flying competition, tonga race and a host of activities planned for each day. This year singers Jassi and Badshah were expected to perform apart from former contestants of Indian Idol and other reality shows. ""Nothing is finalised yet but I have been told to think of an alternate date in case the Mahotsav is postponed,"" says Anupam Srivastava, Regional Tourist Officer, Lucknow division and member of the Lucknow Mahotsav Samiti. ""There is no confirmation that has been given to me, but if the law and order situation gets affected due to the Ayodhya case verdict, then the mahotsav may be shifted to a later date by a day or two or maybe by several weeks or even months. But one thing is for sure that if it gets postponed to a later date, we will surely not have it in extreme winters and have it instead in mid-January,"" adds Srivastava. Meanwhile, according to sources, the Mahotsav may now be organised from January 13, 2020 at the Awadh Shilp Gram, near the Ekana Stadium on Shaheed Path instead of Smriti Upvan Aashiyana, its usual venue.

Ghaziabad,"Ban, what ban? Illegal sand mining continues unabated","GHAZIABAD: Residents of Indirapuram have lifted the veil off uncovered construction material in the area and illegal sand mining on the banks of the Hindon, raising questions on the administration’s claim that they have swooped on pollution violators. The residents said illegal sand miners and a few builders have thrown the pollution control board’s ban on construction to the wind and have been transporting sand without covering it as usual. Not only has the Ghaziabad administration issued a blanket ban on construction, builders and contractors have been asked to keep material such as sand and cement covered. Flat owners in the area said that even on days when Ghaziabad was the country’s worst in terms of air quality, they had seen trucks carrying illegally mined sand uncovered from the banks of the Hindon. They also complained of crushers and cement mixers continuing to operate in the densely populated areas of Ahimsa Khand 2. Following an order from the National Green Tribunal, EPCA has imposed a blanket ban on all construction activity, and operation of hot mix plants and crushers till November 8. “For months, we have been seeing hundreds of trucks moving in and out with sand illegally mined from the river bank. This should have at least been stopped when Ghaziabad’s air quality was in the severe category. But trucks operate during the day as well as night. There is also large amount of construction material that is lying uncovered. Even with the slightest wind, they get mixed with the air and enter our houses. There has been no action on these groups, though a police post is located nearby and all the authorities are aware of the practice,” said Mehul Trivedi, a resident of a high-rise in Ahinsa Khand 2. Many people said they had lodged complaints with the district administration, but to no avail. For several days in the past week, Ghaziabad had seen the worst air quality in the county. In Indirapuram itself, AQI remained in the ‘severe’ category eight out of 11 days — between October 28 and November 4. Indirapuram is also one of the most densely populated areas in trans-Hindon. Officials said they had been watching out for violators, and added that eight persons had been arrested from Indirapuram last Sunday. Residents contended that the arrests hardly had an effect on construction activity. “We do not know about any mining activity. However, we will now get the area inspected. Our teams have been on the field and we have arrested eight persons in Indirapuram for keeping construction material uncovered,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB in Ghaziabad. "

Standing tall at 8ft 2 inches, Sher Khan was disappointed with his team’s 7-wicket defeat and also shared with TOI his colossal struggle to find an accommodation in the city on Tuesday until police came to his help. “Hotels straight away refused to check me in, probably because of my height… They said they lacked infrastructThere were not many to cheer his home team during the Afghanistan-West Indies ODI in Lucknow on Wednesday, but this giant fan who had come all the way from Kabul to boost the morale of Afghan cricketers caught the attention of most. ure to accommodate someone like me,” said Sher Khan who suffers from a rare medical condition called gigantism in which the growth hormone functions abnormally. The man, who reminds one of the great Khali for his looks and hairstyle, eventually landed up at Naka police station where cops helped him find a place to stay. “The problem of Sher Khan and that of hotel owners were genuine in their respective ways. The solution came when one of the hotels volunteered to help,” SHO Sujeet Dubey said. Police, on their part, verified documents of the special guest to convince the hotel owner. Hotel employees were both intrigued and worried while hosting Sher Khan. “People kept visiting our hotel only to see him… The presence of mediapersons added to the hullabaloo. We were worried because our guest was being disturbed,” said a waiter who looked after Khan. The milling crowd outside the hotel prompted police to escort Sher Khan on Wednesday to the Ekana stadium where the international match was being played. “I am used to such attention, but it becomes a problem after a point of time,” a visibly shy Khan told TOI. The cricket buff from Kabul said this was his first time in Lucknow, but he had been to India before. “My visit to Lucknow will remain memorable because of the dichotomy. After I was denied stay at hotels, I felt weird about this city otherwise known for its hospitality. I was compelled to change my mind after police and a hotel owner helped me,” he said. Khan added that he also loved the experience at the stadium when cricket fans from the city cheered for his team with him. "
Lucknow,I’ve not understood this beast called Bollywood: Randeep Hooda,"The past few years may have been disappointing for actor Randeep Hooda professionally, but a more calm and confident Hooda has emerged from it.

But Randeep says the prep for the role made him delve a lot into Sikhism and made him self-introspect, which has brought about a remarkable change in his thinking and life. On his recent visit to Lucknow, the Kick actor talked about the flip side of the film not being made and how it has actually worked for him. You’ve been doing a lot of social work of late like feeding flood hit people in Kerala, cleaning the beach in Mumbai, etc.I feel, you have to go out in the world to feed the actor within you. And I feel that when I do something for a greater good, which is not personally or directly connected to me, I feel better about myself because I think it’s a sense of contribution. Plus, my interest in Sikhism has brought around a lot of changes in me. I guess you only discover what lies within you already. That’s what’s happened to me (laughs). I enjoy it and it’s very enriching. And when you go to these places and meet this people, there’s a sense of reality that hits you. It’s a more normal kind of environment in which I like to go into and I think it’s all connected and was destined for me, I guess. Randeep says his love for animals surpasses everything (BCCL/ @RandeepHooda) Randeep says his love for animals surpasses everything (BCCL/ @RandeepHooda) But what triggered off this feeling of service?I started doing it while preparing for Battle of Saragarghi. Because I saw in the Sikh community their sense of seva which goes beyond just the langar that people see. When I worked with them, I realized what it is when you go and wash dishes in a gurudwara or put people’s footwear away and it’s then that you feel it’s all so humbling. It’s so full of humility and brings in such a sense of service and purpose along with a sense of pride in you in doing whatever it is. So I think it started from there and I would like it to continue. It makes you feel of some worth. There is a sense of peace within me. I have a more of a lightness in being. I have spent a lot of time in my life unable to recognize this angst within me. Anger that I always carried and I couldn’t figure out. What led to it, I don’t know; maybe a series of experiences which lead to that. Ones which probably I’m not aware of. Maybe from my childhood or the teens or my youth. But I carried a lot of angst in me which I used in my art also. But then you get what you beget. So now I’m in a lighter way and it’s making me feel more free, a better human being and also a better actor, I hope! How has it all impacted your professional life?Maybe now you will see me in lighter roles now. Maybe this energy will attract those kind of films for me now. There have been times when I’ve pushed the boundaries in changing myself for a certain character in a film. I did a bit of that in Rang Rasiya, Risk, and I think Main Aur Charles was the first attempt to really alter yourself, then for Sarbjit I got caught up a lot in changing myself not just mentally but physically too. But for Saragarhi I really went overboard. And I think that has stayed with me because it was such a noble yet flawed character. But whatever good you can retain from it, it’s fine. But I can walk away from all of it now. I’m trying that, so let’s see. But you’ve got to come back and that’s what my friend Adil Husain told me while we were doing ...Charles. His guru in Hampi, I think, told him that it (any work) should not be able to affect you and that’s the first time I thought of it and then do things. So I don’t really know. I’m still looking for myself and trying to do what I like best. Trying to recognize what you like, dislike, what you love more than other things is the journey of life and the more you understand it, the more you love life and I’m loving my life. Randeep Hooda (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Randeep Hooda (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Battle of Saragarhi, to which you dedicated two years of your life, never got made. Was it disappointing for you? It is not disappointing, rather it was a changing experience. And it is not as if I am putting on a mask, but I did not do it for that. I grew my hair and beard and stuff but I did it for my own satisfaction and to test my own boundaries. See everybody wants recognition and the fact people are talking about it is recognition in itself. I don’t have to have someone stand up hand me a memento for that. I know where all I lacked in it more than anybody else and I will try and improve upon it if I’m given another chance. So yeah, it wasn’t disappointing that the film never got made, but it has added to my personality immensely. Highway was another changing experience. That was very angsty. That was so long ago and now I’m thinking of how I can be healthier. I wake up early and sleep early. Rather now I wake up when I used to sleep! (laughs). Those are the things that concern me more now than what happened to me a few years ago. You have also been spending a lot of time in the wild and in forests.Yes! Whenever I go to the jungle, I feel there’s a calling within me to be there. As soon as I go to the jungle, life makes sense. Evolution makes sense! If you want to look deeper within yourself you should spend time in nature. It makes you look deep within yourself and gives you a sense of timelessness and makes you aware of the fact that you are actually a very-very-very small part of this evolution. This social media, phone, WhatsApp, and the whole rigmarole of what’s happening in the world and then then you go to the jungle and it all just doesn’t matter! In the scheme of what we are in terms of time, not even a dot we are in the fabric of the universe or even earth that’s going on. And to have a bit of lightness, a jungle is the best place to be. You realize you’re a very small part of the scheme, and to even have a small part of it is huge. For us to make sense of ourselves, we need nature. We need these beautiful things, to even breathe we need nature. An avid photographer, the actor loves clicking pictures of the wildlife and posts them online with hashtags #jungleehooda and #wildrandeep (BCCL/ @RandeepHooda) An avid photographer, the actor loves clicking pictures of the wildlife and posts them online with hashtags #jungleehooda and #wildrandeep (BCCL/ @RandeepHooda) And you have been exploring the jungles all over India.I have explored Maharashtra forest, Madhya Pradesh, a bit of UP and I’ve been to Uttarakhand and also Rajasthan. Now I want to explore the South sanctuaries. I also want to see the Nawabganj Bird Sanctuary which is here close by. I’ve been told it’s in a bad shape so I want to work on that. Birds are the most fascinating and diverse creatures on earth. I wanted to go there very enthusiastically till someone told me that the lake is covered with weeds and birds are not coming there anymore. So I hope something is done to revive that. I would like to request the forest department of UP and Yogi Aditynath the Chief Minister, who I’m told is a nature lover, to please have the lake cleaned out so that the birds can come back again and rejuvenate the place. Nature rejuvenates itself, the birds will start coming in again and it will again become a beautiful place. We saw that at the Versova Beach in Mumbai with the Ridley Turtles. So just like Yogiji stopped the cutting of trees in Kishangarh, near Dudhwa for that road project, I hope he will take notice of the Nawabganj lake too and get it rejuvenated. That decision of his fantastic because it is what impacts our lives most. As long as wildlife is safe, we are safe. Would you say that Bollywood has started taking note of you now?(Laughs heartily) To be honest, I’ve really not understood this beast called Bollywood. I’ve always been working. I’ve worked with almost everybody. I’ve been working in different kinds of films with different kinds of people and I have enjoyed them all. From an absolute commercial pot-boiler like Kick to doing a Sarabjeet to doing a Bombay Talkies to even doing a Charles, I’ve worked with all kinds of people and I’ve enjoyed each experience. There is a thing that you should look at. A lot of people who have been in the industry since long – very successful people – have told me that you shouldn’t change your look too often but I did just that. In the last 14-15 years I’ve been fortunate to have worked with people and I’ve loved what I’ve done. But good, if one says that Bollywood has starting to notice me. It’s high time! Yet you’re not part of any group or ‘gang’ as they say. Randeep cleaning up the beach in Mumbai (BCCL/ @randeephooda) Randeep cleaning up the beach in Mumbai (BCCL/ @randeephooda) My gang is much bigger. It’s got tigers and leopards and sambhars and bears and elephants. Horses and dogs too! Beautiful friends of mine who are always there for me, great parents, family, the great team that I work with. I’m the ‘gang’ man! I have great bunch of director friends so I’m the truly gang man. Your are coming to Lucknow after a long gap. How’s it been this time?I shot in Lucknow many years ago, I guess in 2011. I usually pass through Lucknow going to these forests in Pallia, Lakhimpur Kheri, Dudhwa. I think the heritage arc of Uttar Pradesh is one of the most beautiful. The biodiversity, rich dense forests which are still untouched. It is still one of the most beautiful places on the earth! So I think extra care should be taken to preserve it and find ways to circumvent the forest and not go inside it. And also there has to be more pressing of relocating certain villages from within the core areas of the jungle. And the government provides very good incentives for it. It will also enrich people’s lives. Yes, it’s understandable that it has been people’s homes forever, but it’s also a necessity to preserve that very thing with the consent of the people there. But of course Lucknow is a gem in itself in terms of heritage. It’s a beautiful blend of heritage with modern. I see historical places and beside them these modern buildings. And of course, yahan ki tehzeeb, of course ab utni nahi rahi but Haryana ke hisaab se toh abhi bhi bahut hai. (laughs) "

Lucknow,"UPPCL boss Alok Kumar shunted out, Arvind takes charge","LUCKNOW: Less than a week after an alleged provident fund (PF) scam involving investment of power employees PF money in tainted DHFL rocked the state, the UP government on Friday removed UPPCL chairman and principal secretary (energy) Alok Kumar from his post and posted him as principal secretary in the infrastructural and industrial development department. Alok Kumar has been replaced by Arvind Kumar, who was with the transport department as its principal secretary. The development comes three days after the state government removed UPPCL managing director Aparna U and transferred her to the irrigation department as its secretary after the alleged PF scam surfaced. The chairman's transfer comes amid massive ongoing protest by UPPCL employees union, which has been demanding removal of Alok Kumar, who also happens to be the chairman of the UP Power Sector Employees' Trust, which invested money in the defaulting DHFL. The employees union has been demanding Alok Kumar's removal from the post, holding him responsible for the irregularity. Earlier, UP energy minister Srikant Sharma had written a stinging letter to UP chief minister accusing Alok Kumar of being responsible for the anomaly resulting in over Rs 2,260 crores getting trapped in DHFL following a Bombay high court order. Alok Kumar's transfer comes in the midst of the ongoing inquiry by economic offence wing (EOW), which has already arrested two former UPPCL officials including former MD Ayodhya Prasad Mishra. The state government has already recommended a CBI inquiry into the case, which has put the ruling BJP in a state of discomfiture. Anonymous letter spoke of violationKumar has been in the eye of a potential storm since July earlier this year when he received an anonymous letter saying that employees funds have been invested in housing finance companies in violation of guidelines. The complaint triggered an outrage even as Kumar constituted an internal inquiry to probe as to how the money got invested in fixed deposits of housing companies. As per rules, the money should have been invested in government securities which are considered to be much safer. The irregularity in investment of PF money had also created a political row with the opposition parties mounting pressure on the ruling BJP, daring it to come out clean on the issue. A legal tussle between Sharma and UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu had also erupted with the latter accusing Sharma of having role in the alleged scam. "

The administration has already imposed Section 144 of the IPC in the district and set up a round-the-clock monitoring station. Earlier, a high-level meeting chaired by Meerut divisional commissioner Anita Meshram took place, where IG Meerut zone, district magistrate and others officials were present. “We have already imposed Section 144 of the IPC, which bars any kind of assembly in the district.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Protests after student dies in crash,"GHAZIABAD: A 20-year-old student was killed and two others were injured when the auto-rickshaw they were travelling in had a head-on collision with a roadways bus in Masuri area on Thursday.

We reached the hospital where Gaurav’s friend and police had taken him. There, the doctors asked us to take him to another hospital. We took him to Sarvodaya hospital but the doctors declared him dead at 10pm,” he said. “Accidents have become a regular thing on the stretch and no one is ready to take responsibility. The traffic police and other authorities are not taking any steps. We blocked the highway for over three hours and demanded justice for Gaurav,” said a student who took part in the protest.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Duo broke into 50 flats in six months, held","GHAZIABAD: Two men were arrested on Friday for allegedly breaking into houses in several societies. Police said the two men had broken into at least 50 houses in the city over the past six months and decamped with jewellery, cash and electronic items. Police claimed that with their arrest, they have solved over a dozen theft cases in Ghaziabad. The arrested men include Kamil, the gang leader from Sambhar town in Jaipur, and Rajesh Dubey, a resident of Delhi. Four others are absconding. On October 7, they had stolen cash and jewellery worth Rs 40 lakh from a businessman’s house. Police claimed to have recovered jewellery worth Rs 20 lakh and Rs 5 lakh cash from the two. Umesh Bahadur Singh, the SHO of Sihani Gate police station, said, “We had leads from CCTV footage in one of the crime scenes in which the two were seen scouting the houses. They would stroll in societies and if guards stopped them, they would tell fake names. They broke into locked houses within 20-25 minutes where they would only steal items like cash, jewellery, watches, etc. that were easier to carry in their bags,” said Singh, adding that they would also carry weapons along with them, but never used them in any of the theft cases. The SHO said that the case has thrown light on the lapses in security of highrises and the police department will issue an advisory to residents welfare associations (RWAs) and apartment owners associations (AOAs) to strengthen the security in order to avoid such cases.

Lucknow,"Ayodhya verdict: Lucknow chooses to remain home, stays glued to television, cellphones","LUCKNOW: City streets and markets wore a deserted look on Saturday as people preferred to stay indoors during the day apprehending law and order problem in view of Supreme Court verdict in Ayodhya case. Curfew-like situation prevailed in Aashiana, Daliganj, Sitapur road, Aliganj and Gomtinagar where people remained glued to television sets and phones for news. Though the state administration ordered closure of schools and colleges till Monday, very few people visited city malls or market during day hours.

Lucknow,Every Indian considers Ram an ancestor: Yogi Adityanath,"LUCKNOW: Reacting to the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya issue, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that he has complete faith that a grand temple dedicated to Lord Ram will be built at his birthplace. He welcomed the verdict, saying that a 492-year-old dispute had been ended in a peaceful manner, strengthening India’s democracy. In a blog on his official portal, Yogi wrote, “Due to political interests, some outfits had, under a conspiracy, turned Ayodhya into a very sensitive issue. However, Ayodhya was solely a matter of faith. Everyone Indian who believes in a supreme power, irrespective of their faith, considers Ram to be their ancestor.” The CM added that this verdict was not about anybody’s victory or defeat but just the reiteration of truth and justice. Addressing himself as a yogi and an ascetic, he wrote, “An ascetic’s life is dedicated to the welfare of the people. From a political perspective, I have adopted a nationalist ideology and followed the policy of development. When I took over as CM of UP, the situation of Ayodhya, which had become untouchable because of narrow politics over the years, pricked my heart. I took an oath to bring back Ayodhya’s glory and develop Ram Janmabhoomi on priority. That is why we started Deepotsav.” Ram has been a central figure in the religious and cultural diversity of India, the CM wrote, adding that he was reminded of his ‘guru’ Mahant Avaidyanath, who had played an important role in the Ramjanmabhoomi movement. “He used to say that Lord Ram’s virtues of justice, equality, discipline and sacrifice should be the ideals for every political leader,” wrote Yogi, adding that he was following the same. Earlier in the day, addressing the media, he had said, the (proposed) Ram temple would be a “national temple” which will spread the fame of India to all corners of this world. “It will also fulfil Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s determination to make India ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat’”, he had said.

Lucknow,‘Gorakshpeeth epicentre of temple movement’,"LUCKNOW: Even though senior BJP leaders refrained from taking any credit for the success of Ram temple movement, the party pointed out that Gorakshpeeth has had deep links with Ramjanmabhoomi movement and CM Yogi Adityanath, the peethadheeshwar and head priest of Gorakhnath Temple, visited the temple town 18 times in last two-and-a-half years. The party pointed out that Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav was CM from 2012 to 2017 but he did not visit Ram Lalla even once. “Since 1992, when the disputed structure was brought down, all leaders refrained from visiting Ram Lalla. Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra never visited Ram Lalla,” said a BJP functionary. Sources in Gorakhnath Math said all major events related to Ramjanmabhoomi movement have had some link or with Gorakshpeeth. “The agitation itself started under the leadership of Mahant Digvijay Nath. On the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949, when idol of Ram Lalla appeared at the site, then Mahant Digvijay Nath was singing bhajans with other seers,” claimed a source. Digvijay Nath was appointed Hindu Mahasabha general secretary and won election from Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat in 1967, he added. Subsequently, in 1986 when then Faizabad DM gave orders to open the locks of the disputed site to allow Hindus to offer prayers there, Mahant Avaidyanath was present at the site to open the lock. Thereafter, under the leadership of Avaidyanath, Gorakhnath Temple became the centre of the Ramjanmabhoomi agitation, he said. “And now, when the apex court order has cleared the way for the construction of Ram temple, Yogi Adityanath, the current Mahant of temple, is the chief minister of UP. He became associated with the movement soon after taking over the reins of Gorakshpeeth. Now, when the judgment has come, he is the chief minister and the task of getting the temple constructed will rest on his shoulders,” he said. "

However, the Shia board clarified it would not go in for an appeal. The Sunni board’s chairman Zufar Faruqi said, “Any statement in this regard by an individual, lawyer or organisation which mentions that UP Sunni Central Waqf Board will go for a review is not our line.” Faruqi was referring to the reaction of Sunni board counsel Zafaryab Jilani earlier in the day, saying the verdict has contradictions. “We will seek a review,” Jilani had said. But he later clarified that he had reacted as AIMPLB secretary and not as the Sunni board counsel. Faruqi said Muslim outfits, in general, had agreed earlier that they would welcome whatever verdict SC pronounced. However, Shia board chief Wasim Rizvi questioned the granting of land to Sunni board, saying Babri Masjid was built by Mir Baqi, a Shia. "
Lucknow,‘Hats off to all the people who are part of the Bigg Boss house’ Tinaa Dattaa,"Tinaa Dattaa in Lucknow (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Yashi Agarwal Actress Tinaa Dattaa, who started her acting career from the age of 5 in the Bengali film 'Chokher Bali' along with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, and gained fame with her television stint in the serial 'Uttaran', was in Lucknow recently. In a freewheeling chat with us, Tina spoke at length about her love for Lucknow, her television and filmy career, and more.  “Lucknow is such a beautiful city, I absolutely love it. One of the major reasons for loving this city so much is food. I’m a hardcore foodie and Lucknow offers the best biryani and mutton keema parantha. Dastarkhwan happens to be one of my favourite places in the city with mouth-watering food. Also, I like shopping and the chikankari work here is so beautiful. There’s nothing like a chikan sari or a suit or a kurta, they’re all just so pretty. She adds, “Every time I’m in Lucknow I go to Seva Chikan and purchase so many suits and saris that I land up getting overloaded with luggage while flying back to Mumbai.”  Tinaa’s first project was a Bengali serial called 'Sister Nivedita' starring Moon Moon Sen but due to some reason it didn’t take off. “I did a lot of work in the Bengali industry at the start of my career. It’s fun being a part of your own regional cinema. And now, of late, Bengali movies have been doing outstandingly well at the Box Office. Right from the way they are shot to the concept, its mind-blowing. If given an opportunity, I’d love to be a part of Bengali films.” Tinaa seems very happy with the way things have lined up for her, specially her career as she managed to try out various types of roles and didn’t stick to one character. Speaking about the same, Tinaa says, “I don’t think you can plan your career move specially when you’re doing a daily soap. You never know about the time frame of a television serial. You’re so committed to your own show that you can’t exactly plan ahead as you don’t know how long the show will get aired. The show can run for a year, six years, some shows have been going on for more than eight years now. So its uncertain. As for me, I’m very happy with the way my career has shaped up. I wanted to do something different after 'Uttaran' and so I worked in a mythological show after which I did a non-fiction series. So I guess it’s safe to say that I did manage to experiment. Currently, also I’m looking forward to a different kind of role, say a negative character onscreen or something like that.” Rumour mills were abuzz with reports that Tinaa would be entering the Bigg Boss house this year, hearing which the actress has a good laugh. “This rumour was everywhere. I don’t mind being a part of 'Bigg Boss' sometime later but not as of now. I don’t think I’m in the right frame of mind to enter that house. You need to have immense patience and maturity to be able to handle that place considering one’s stranded in a house with 15 different strangers. It’s not easy. Hats off to all the people who are part of the house.” Rumoured to be once married to supervising producer Mahesh Kumar Jaiswal from her debut show 'Koi Aane Ko Hai', the actress says, “I have rubbished these rumours several times before also. There is no truth in my marriage rumours.” So is she looking to get married anytime soon? “I personally feel that there’s a lot of insecurity when you settle down with an actor. Having said that, many actors and actresses have had successful marriages too, but I want someone from outside the industry. I think it’ll be better. I don’t want any ego clashes or insecurity issues marrying someone from the same industry. You see Shilpa Shetty Kundra or Madhuri Dixit Nene, they are so happily married. They settled with people from outside the industry. Even I would love to do something like that.” — Yashi Agarwal "
Lucknow,"Sunni Waqf Board won't file review plea, Shias follow suit","LUCKNOW: The UP Sunni Waqf Board, a key Muslim litigant, welcomed the Supreme Court judgment on Ayodhya title suit and announced it will not file a review or curative petition against the order. UP Shia Central Waqf Board, another party to the case, also hailed the decision, while stating that the 5 acre land allocated to Sunni Board should have been given to it, but clarified it would not go in for appeal. Welcoming Saturday's verdict, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board chairman, Zufar Faruqi, said if someone else files a review petition, it would not be in Board's name. ""Any statement in this regard by an individual, lawyer or organisation which mentions that UP Sunni Central Waqf Board will go for a review is not our line,"" he said.

Jilani later clarified the press conference was organised by All India Muslim Personal Law Board and he reacted as its secretary and not as counsel for Sunni Waqf Board. Faruqi, however, said Muslim organisations, in general, already agreed to welcome the court order, whatever it may be, and ""it won't be right"" if they change the stand. He further said the Board had not demanded the 5 acre land granted to it as alternate site for a mosque, but added it ""respects the court's decision"". ""I will be calling a meeting of the Board soon and finalise our stand,"" said Faruqi. Faruqi also thanked the court for upholding the Places of Worship Act, 1991. ""By mentioning it in the judgment, the court has strengthened the Act. We are grateful to them for setting aside as 'erroneous' the 2010 observation of an Allahabad high court judge, which diluted the provision of Places of Worship Act,"" he said. Shia Central Waqf Board president Wasim Rizvi also welcomed the verdict, saying they were always in favour of a Ram temple at Ramjanmabhoomi, but questioned the granting of 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board. He said the Babri Mosque was built by Mir Baqi, who was a Shia. ""Instead of giving it to Sunni Waqf Board, the land should have been given to us. However, the Board will not file a review petition. We do not want an alternative site in lieu of an encroachment on temple site. Shia community has several legal mosques,"" he said. "

Ghaziabad,"Strict vigil in Ghaziabad, posts monitored","GHAZIABAD: The city did not report any unrest or untoward incident on Saturday as vigil was stepped up in the entire district, especially in sensitive areas, in light of the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit. With the administration imposing Section 144 of CrPC late Friday night, more than 5,000 personnel from police, home guard and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) were deployed to ensure there was no breach in peace. Besides, four ‘highly sensitive’ and 58 ‘sensitive’ areas had been identified by police and the sale of loose petrol, acid and other inflammable substances had been banned. As per the state government orders, educational institutions remained closed. A senior police officer said that about a 100 ‘suspicious’ persons, who have been involved in riots and other community fights in the past, are under surveillance. Besides, a team of 50 personnel from the cyber cell also monitored content circulated on social media platforms. Cops said they kept an eye on about 800 accounts for any inflammatory posts. SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh said, “I think Ghaziabad police have managed everything very well. The situation in the district is normal and residents are busy with their day-to-day work.” District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, who visited sensitive areas in the district with the SSP, said, “The day passed off peacefully. We will keep the same level of preparedness for the next few days.” Meanwhile, many stretches in the city wore a deserted look. “There was less traffic because it was the second Saturday (of the month). All government offices and schools were closed,” said an official. City Imam K Z Bukhari said his community had accepted the verdict with grace. “I met many people from my community and was pleasantly surprised that there was no unrest in their minds,” he said, adding, “I am relieved that this contentious issue has reached its logical end and after today, it will no longer be a bone of contention between the two communities.” He added that for in the coming days, similar maturity and vigil would need to be maintained. Mahant Narayan Giri said the Supreme Court decision had been received well by both the communities. “The past is behind us and the matter should cease to exist for the communities as a whole,” he said.

Lucknow,How the Lord fought &amp; won Ayodhya suit,"LUCKNOW: With the Supreme Court declaring the makeshift temple’s presiding deity, Ram Lalla Virajman, as owner of the disputed land in Ayodhya, the 70-year-old title suit created legal history on Saturday with the Lord himself being a party to the case and winning it. And it was Ram Lalla’s ‘next friend’ Triloki Nath Pandey, who represented the Lord in court and finally won the protracted battle after the apex court rejected the claims of key litigants, Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Central Waqf Board. Talking to TOI, 75-year-old Pandey calls it the end of Ram’s second vanavas (exile). “The Lord will now be able to move to a majestic temple from its present tarpaulin abode. It’s the victory of Ram Lalla Virajman, but the best thing is that no one has lost,” he said. Pandey has been pursuing the case in court on Ram Lalla’s behalf since 2010. He was allotted one-third of the disputed site at Ayodhya — sanctum sanctorum — by the Allahabad High Court on September 30 in that year, but he challenged the decision in Supreme Court. Under Indian law, a deity is an individual entity and like a firm or a trust can contest its own case. The deity (Ram Lalla Virajman) is a perpetual minor and needed a ‘next friend’ to represent itself in court. Pandey is the third ‘next friend’ of Ram Lalla. Earlier, retired judge Deoki Nandan Agarwal (1986-1996) and historian Thakur Prasad Verma (1996-2009) represented the infant God in courts. Agarwal, an advocate who later became a judge in Allahabad High Court, was a resident of the Sangam city and later the vice-president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). After retirement, he extensively researched documents and filed a petition in Allahabad High Court in 1989, claiming the land belonged to Ram Lalla and he was his ‘next friend’. The court accepted his petition. He also challenged the status of Nirmohi Akhara in the title suit, but died in April 2002. Agarwal was succeeded by BHU professor Thakur Prasad Verma in court. Later, because of his age and failing health, he withdrew in 2008 and Triloki Nath Pandey, a VHP office-bearer, took over as ‘next friend’ of Ram Lalla. “I am happy that Ram Lalla will finally get his due. I am also happy the decision took place in my lifetime. The verdict is clear and to the point and the bench left no room for any ambiguity. At the same time, it has been able to strike a balance between religious and national interest,” Pandey said. Pandey, however, expressed concern about the possibility of Nirmohi Akhara filing a review petition. “I would urge them to join hands with us and take forward the task of temple construction,” he said.

Lucknow,"In peaceful Kashi, namaz and prayers go hand in hand","LUCKNOW: Vitriolic slogans that reverberated in Ayodhya after the Babri Masjid demolition did not find echo 27 years later at Kashi’s disputed site, where the Gyanvapi mosque shares its premises with the Vishwanath temple. The ancient city was visibly calm with Muslims offering afternoon namaaz at Gyanvapi mosque, while thousands of pilgrims, mostly from South India and Maharashtra, queuing up to offer prayers at the adjacent temple amid tight security. The day passed off peacefully in all 10 districts of Varanasi zone, including Azamgarh and Mau. A massive security cover was in place at the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi complex. ADG Varanasi zone, Brij Bhushan, said security arrangements will continue in coming days.

Though many residents had stocked up groceries and other essentials on Friday in anticipation of a shutdown, markets remained open and everyday activities went on uninterrupted on Saturday. "
Lucknow,"Ayodhya verdict: BJP on temple run, UP satraps to rethink plan","LUCKNOW: The Supreme Court verdict on Saturday paving the way for the construction of a Ram temple on the disputed site might now have regional parties in UP - Samajwadi party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) - going back to the drawing board to rethink their strategies ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections even as BJP moves towards the state polls with a clear advantage. The Opposition, mainly SP, will have to fight the effects of acts like jailing the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya in 1990, when Mulayam Singh Yadav was chief minister, and then the firing on karsevaks in Ayodhya, also under Mulayam's chief ministership. BJP had been taunted by the Opposition in the past for the delay in mandir construction with slogans like ""Mandir wahin banayenge, tarikh nahi batayenge (We will build a Ram temple but won't give you a date by when it will be built)"" and ""Ram Lalla tirpal mein, sare neta maal mein (Ram Lalla lives under a tent, leaders live in comfort)"". Now, the Opposition has run out of ammunition on this issue and will have to rethink not only how to plan its own moves ahead of the state elections but also how to counter BJP. The slogan ""Modi hai to mumkin hai"" will now reverberate stronger, emphasising how ""injustice"" has been meted out to Hindus for the last 500 years and how the temple dream will finally be fulfilled. Political observers say that BJP and other right-wing groups may be restraining themselves from making a big noise or celebrating for now, but in the heat and dust of elections this issue could help it get traction and take the wind out of the Opposition's sails.

TOI had reported on October 17 that the panel had informed the SC that the Muslim parties were willing to give up their claim on the disputed site if some conditions were met, including construction of a mosque at an alternative site. Para 5 of the Sunni Central Waqf Board’s settlement offer states, “Sunni Waqf Board, first and main plaintiff, has no objection in relinquishing all rights, interests and claims over the land and is entering into this settlement in larger interest of harmony. The board confirms there’s no bar on acquisition of the land by the central government under Section 51 (1-A of Waqf Act, 1995, or any other law). The board may build a mosque at another suitable place, keeping in view requirements of local Muslims.” Para 14 clearly says, “The court may also consider using the settlement as the foundation for its order and decree under Article 142 of Constitution and do justice by bringing a comprehensive, effective and harmonious end to the dispute.” For relinquishing its claim, the Sunni Waqf Board put riders, including allowing namaz at ASI-controlled mosques.

Lucknow,How a two-room memorial school turned into a 225-acre Lucknow University,"In the summer of 1862, first viceroy of British India Charles John Canning breathed his last in London. Around 4,500 miles away, a bunch of loyal taluqdars in Awadh decided to donate eight anna (half a rupee) from their annual income to start an academic institution in his memory. Two years later, Canning High School was born. What began as a cradle with 200-odd students in two rooms of a haveli in the narrow lanes of Khayaliganj, Aminabad, is today one of the oldest residential universities of the country. The University of Lucknow, which formally became a varsity in 1920, sprawls over 225 acre in Hasanganj and has over 1.5 lakh students across its campuses and affiliated colleges. As the university steps into its centenary year on November 25, here’s looking back in pride at its interesting genesis. According to a document from 1906, attributed to Mohammed Tasadduqi Khan — the Raja of Jehangirabad Oudh (now Barabanki district), the taluqdars wanted to build a college in honour of Lord Canning on a plot of land in Kaiserbagh that the viceroy had once gifted them. First academic session began in July 1921They managed to open a school (instead) at Aminuddaulah Palace in present-day Aminabad on May 1, 1864. There were 200 students on the rolls till Class X,” historian Yogesh Praveen told TOI. In 1866, the high school was elevated to Canning College. In the early days, the college had no building of its own and had an almost peripatetic existence, shifting from one place to another, including Lal Baradari where Lalit Kala Academy is housed at present. It got a building of its own in Kaiserbagh (currently, Rai Umanath Bali Auditorium and Bhatkhandey Music Institute), but the growing demand for space prompted another relocation. In 1878, Canning College finally had a permanent address in Badshah Bagh, Hasanganj, where it stands even today. The foundation stone of the new building was laid by Sir John Lawrence on November 13, 1867, but it took around 11 years to be ready. The main building was patterned in Indo-Saracenic style with high ceiling and wooden stairways. It was formally inaugurated by Sir George EW Couper, then lieutenant-governor of northwestern provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh on November 15, 1878. Canning College remained a recognised institution under Calcutta University for 20 years from 1867 till it came under the jurisdiction of Allahabad University in 1888. The University of Lucknow Bill was introduced in the Legislative Council on August 12, 1920. It was referred to a select committee that passed it after amendments on October 8, 1920. Canning College was merged with Isabella Thoburn College and King George’s Medical College to form the university. GN Chakravarti, then pro-vice-chancellor of Banaras Hindu University (BHU), was made the first vice-chancellor of University of Lucknow on December 16, 1920. The academic session began in July 1921 and the first convocation was held in October 1922. "

Lucknow,VHP decides to construct Ram temple through crowd-funding,"LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: VHP has decided to seek contributions for the proposed Ram Mandir and has also decided to explore ways to enlist the involvement of Ram bhakts in its construction, potentially setting the stage for yet another mass mobilisation for the Ayodhya temple. “Ram bhakts (devotees) from across the country will be approached for contribution to the construction of the Ram temple. The Ayodhya movement was associated with the faith and sentiments of scores of Hindus and they will have to do their bit, including ‘kar seva’, whenever the project begins,” said Vinod Bansal, national spokesperson of VHP, the Sangh affiliate which spearheaded the campaign for the construction of the temple. “A formal plan will be out soon,” Bansal told TOI. Besides, VHP has decided to suggest that the trust that is to be formed within three months should facilitate the symbolic participation of “bhakts” in the construction of what has been imagined as a “grand Ram temple”. Devotees from all 718 districts of the country will be invited in delegations to stay for at least a week and help in construction work, said the VHP functionary, an indication that another round of “kar seva” could be in the works. “Kar seva”, or voluntary work, formed an important part of the VHP-led “Mandir” movement with lakhs reaching Ayodhya in 1990, and again in 1992, the second round resulting in the demolition of Babri Masjid. VHP functionaries in Delhi confirmed the crowd-funding plan. “There is no ambiguity about the plan that funds will be pooled in directly from Hindu devotees of Lord Ram spread across the globe. The process to seek contributions will start soon for which teams will be constituted to ensure that it is done smoothly,” VHP working president Alok Kumar told TOI. He said VHP has pledged only to use contributions from people for temple construction. VHP’s statements come amid reinforced indications that it will have a significant representation in the temple trust. The Supreme Court had, in its verdict on Saturday, denied any role for VHP-promoted Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas in temple construction. However, sources said the government, which will have the final say in the matter, appears inclined to include in the trust Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, who headed the Nyas, as well as some of the key Hindu seers aligned with VHP. The decision to pool funds is in sync with what Mahatma Gandhi had suggested when he offered his support for the reconstruction of the Somnath temple. Gandhi gave his consent to the move to revive the temple, which had been attacked and plundered repeatedly by invaders, but told the prime movers — Sardar Patel and K M Munshi —that they should not take money from the government. “For a temple dedicated to Lord Ram, funds must come from the public. Taxpayer money should not have any role in the project. We shall start the fund collection once the trust takes over,” Kumar said. “Some people may contribute shilas (sandstone), while others may donate money. We leave everything to people,” he added. VHP sources in Ayodhya said they expect the construction to begin around Makar Sankranti in January or Ram Navami in April next year. “The ball is in the court of the government which has to take a call on the issue,” said a senior VHP functionary. VHP functionaries said enlisting popular support for the construction of the temple will be a respectful gesture to the devotees, who have waited “generations” to see it happen. “We shall urge the trust to allow the visit of delegations from each district of the country to hand out a brick for the construction,” Kumar said. He said over 60% of the temple has already been carved but construction will start after complying with the norms. “We have to abide by the norm as the temple will be dedicated to ‘Maryada Purushottam’.” "

Lucknow,"Kalyan Singh to visit Ayodhya soon, says dream fulfilled","LUCKNOW: Former UP chief minister and an accused in Babri mosque demolition case, Kalyan Singh, on Monday said Ram Temple in Ayodhya was not a political issue, but was intrinsically linked to the country’s cultural tenets. Kalyan was speaking to reporters, two days after Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya. “I am a Ram Bhakt and have been dreaming about the temple for decades. I will soon go to Ayodhya,’’ said Kalyan, under whose regime the Babri mosque was demolished by a frenzied mob of karsewaks in 1992. Singh said the apex court judgment should not be seen as a victory or loss for anyone. “The government will form a trust which will build a grand temple,’’ he said. Kalyan said the construction of a Ram Temple will pave way for further development of the temple town. “It’s time Ayodhya’s development is put on fast track and chief minister Yogi Adityanath is committed to this.” Responding to a query on the Babri demolition chargesheet against him and other senior BJP leaders, Singh it was for the CBI to answer. “As many as 39 witnesses have been examined. Now, the investigation agency will take it forward,’’ he said. In September, CBI moved high court to prosecute Kalyan Singh after his gubernatorial term in Rajasthan ended. Singh, enjoyed immunity from trial while he held the constitutional post. "
Lucknow,Ayodhya verdict: AIMPLB meet on November 17 to decide on review plea,"LUCKNOW: All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Monday said it will take a decision on filing a petition in Supreme Court seeking review of the Ayodhya verdict, after its working committee meeting next week. The board called a special meeting of all 51 working committee members, including Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi at Lucknow’s Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama on November 17. AIMPLB officials said it will also decide on which of the other five Muslim litigants can file the review plea, if the board decides to embark on that path. According to the board, an umbrella body of all Muslim sects, the Sunni Central Waqf Board is only “one part” of the Muslim side in the case. The waqf board has already clarified it won’t review the verdict. “The AIMPLB decided in its last meeting on October 12 that it will meet after the SC verdict to discuss the judgment at length and decide the way forward, both legally and practically. The legal committee, Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind and Jamaat-e-Islami will participate in the meeting,” said board spokesperson and secretary, Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani. Counsel in the title suit and convener of AIMPLB’s Babri Masjid Action Committee, Zafaryab Jilani, said, the Sunni Waqf Board is only a part of the Muslim side, opening a window for other litigants to seek review of the verdict, if such a decision is taken. “This can be done through litigants, Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind, Iqbal Ansari, Mohammad Umar, Misbahuddin and Maulana Fazlur Rahman. Defendants in the case Haji Mahboob and two sons of Haji Abdul Ahad and Maulana Hazbullah can also be approached,” he said. Though AIMPLB is not a party in the case, it has been providing financial and legal assistance to litigants. “It will also be explored if AIMPLB can file a review petition,” Jilani added. “I won’t agree to filing a review if asked. For 70 years, we kept providing documents to court, but faith won over facts. The review will also bear the same result so what is the point,” said litigant Iqbal Ansari. "
Lucknow,"Golden advice from a General: Failure is a challenge, accept it","LUCKNOW: General Bipin Rawat, the Chief of Army Staff and chief guest at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s (BBAU) eighth convocation, wore a poet’s hat on Monday to teach students how to deal with failures. “Asafalta ek chunauti hai, Isko sweekar karo tum, Kahan khamiya reh gayi, Inpar vichar karo tum, Mehnat aur lagan ke saath aagey badhey chalo, Phir kabhi peechhey mat dekho, Aur har nayi choti pe parcham leharaye chalo, leharaye chalo (Failure is a challenge, accept it; reflect on your shortcomings and move ahead; Never look back),” Rawat read out these lines from a poem that he said inspired him during tough times. Deviating from the usual practice of asking politicians or academics to grace its degree day, BBAU this year invited the army chief. The spirit of nationalism peaked as soon as he entered the convocation hall. Students shouted, ‘Jai hind, Sir; Bharat Mata ki jai’ and saluted him. General Rawat returned the gesture. “The presence of the man who commands the Indian Army was inspiring. The poem was a bonus. We will now remember this day not for the gold medal we won, but for the golden advice he gave,” said MSc (Zoology) topper Astha Singh. As many as 1,626 students were conferred degrees on Monday and 251 from 2017-18 and 2018-19 batches received gold medals. "
Lucknow,"Gold medallist violates dress code, barred at convocation","LUCKNOW: A 2018-batch Dalit student, who topped in MA (Sociology) and was to be conferred three gold medals, was not allowed to attend the convocation at BBAU on Monday for violating the dress code. BBAU’s alleged high-handedness against Kranti Kumar — currently pursuing his MPhil at JNU — coincided with a clash between JNU students and police in Delhi following a protest over a host of issues, including dress code. Kumar arrived at the venue in formal wear instead of the mandatory kurta-pyjama. He wanted to advocate for freedom of choice and pay a tribute to Ambdedkar who always dressed in formal clothes on special occasions. The alumnus was seated among gold medallists in the front rows at the convocation, which was attended by Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat. He said he was first asked to leave by a faculty member and later forcibly removed from the venue by police. He was allegedly detained at the proctor’s office till the end of the function. “I am not a criminal and yet was kept under detention (at the proctor’s office) for around six hours. This despite me requesting the vice-chancellor (Sanjay Singh) and others to allow me to wear formal clothes in a tribute to Ambedkar and for an individual’s freedom of choice,” said Kumar who hails from Andhra Pradesh. “India thrives in its diversity. Imposing dress code on students is unfair. I am more comfortable in formal wear. I had sought prior permission for myself and for those underprivileged students who cannot afford the convocation ensemble,” he said, adding that the vice-chancellor didn’t reply to his request. BBAU officials denied allegations of harassment and high-handedness, stating that they only followed rules. “The convocation dress code is cleared by the academic council. Hence, it is binding on all students. We did not allow on stage any student who was not following the dress code,” spokesperson Rachna Gangwar said. She denied that Kumar was detained at the proctor’s office. "
Lucknow,"In a first, Lucknow University registrar gets additional charge as VC","LUCKNOW: Registrar of Lucknow University SK Shukla was given additional charge as its vice-chancellor on Monday because the governor, who is also the chancellor of state varsities, failed to find a suitable successor to incumbent SP Singh whose three-year term ended on the same day. “The term of current VC... expired on November 11 (Monday) and appointment of a regular incumbent is taking some time... Using the power given to chancellor under Section 12 (10) of the UP State Universities Act, 1973, I have directed the registrar, SK Shukla, to discharge additional responsibility of VC for next six months or till further orders,” Governor Anandiben Patel said in her order. This is the first time that a registrar, who is a Provincial Civil Services officer, has been given additional charge in the absence of a regular vice-chancellor. Some senior teachers objected to the appointment, saying the post was academic and the registrar was only the head of the clerical unit. They said the tradition was to appoint a teacher — pro-VC or senior-most professor — to the chair. Raj Bhawan officials, however, insisted that under the said section of the Act, the chancellor could appoint a suitable person to the vice-chancellor’s office for a term not exceeding six months. These special circumstances include the situation “when a vacancy in the office occurs, and cannot be conveniently and expeditiously filled in accordance with norms”. A section of teachers contested the claim, citing Section 12 (11) of the Act. It states that if there is no regular VC, the pro-VC will discharge duties and in case there is no pro-VC, then the senior-most professor will be given charge. Raj Bhawan officials countered the argument. They said the role of pro-VC or senior-most professor came into play only in two scenarios. One, if the chancellor is not able to appoint any suitable person, regular or acting, to the post. Two, if the said person is not able to assume office within stipulated time. "

DM Kushinagar, A K Singh said the MoU was signed when Mulayam Singh Yadav was the chief minister of the state. “It was signed in 2003 and amended in 2014 under the Akhilesh Yadav government.

The Cabinet also cleared Uttar Pradesh Municipality Rules -2019 and an amendment to the State University Act, 1973, for setting up of the Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University in Aligarh.

Lucknow,Crowdfunding for 57 years gave birth to elite Lucknow varsity,"LUCKNOW: Long before the term ‘crowdfunding’ became popular in the early 21st century, the practice of funding a project by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people was witnessed during the establishment of a school that graduated into a college and then became a university of indisputable repute. In 1864, voluntary deduction of eight anna (half a rupee) from the annual income of taluqdars gave birth to Canning High School in Aminabad. It took 57 more years of generous donation of cash, land and even war bonds (debt securities issued by a government to finance military operations and other expenditure in times of war) to turn the two-room school into the first campus of University of Lucknow (LU). Dated March 21, 1921, the minutes of the first annual meeting of LU court gives a detailed account of how funding was rustled up. In our e-age parlance, how the varsity came into being through ‘crowdfunding’. “The total sum promised in subscription up to 19th March, 1921, as reported by the Commissioner of Lucknow and the secretary of Lucknow University funds committee amounts to Rs 29,60,459, inclusive of the two donations announced by His Excellency, The Governor, at the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone. Of this sum, Rs 1,70,225 has been received in war bonds,” the minutes read. This oldest surviving LU document further states: “Cash collections up to date (March 19) amount to Rs 12.88 lakh… Of this, Rs 2.43 lakh has been placed in a fixed deposit. The balance is either in the Imperial Bank or in the district treasuries.” The statement of finance was issued by LU’s first honorary treasurer EAH Blunt. The fascinating story of ‘crowdfunding’ even before the term’s etymological origin also unfolds in the first journal of LU published in September 1922. It says the idea of starting a university was mooted by Raja Sir Mohammad Ali Khan, Khan Bahadur, Knight Commander (KCIE) of Mahmudabad, who contributed an article to The Pioneer, urging the foundation of the University of Lucknow. In 1919, governor of United Provinces Sir Harcourt Spencer Butler played catalyst and proposed the funding scheme for the new varsity. A general meeting of the British Indian Association in connection with the proposed university was held in Kaiserbagh on February 4, 1920. It was announced that an advance of nearly Rs 11 lakh for the establishment of LU had been pooled in. The sum included contributions from the Maharaja of Balarampur (Rs 3 lakh), Raja of Mahmudabad (Rs 1 lakh), Raja of Jehangirabad (Rs 1 lakh), Rani of Mahomadi (Rs 1 lakh), Raja of Utranla (Rs 1.10 lakh) and Sir Harman Singh (Rs 50,000). All those who made donations of Rs 25,000 and above were made lifetime members of the LU court, says the journal. Sir Butler appealed for another Rs 50 lakh. The event was covered by esteemed national dailies. According to newspaper reports on February 6, 1920, the taluqdars expressed their gratefulness to Butler for accepting their request to establish “a university for the benefit of the people of Oudh”.

He also said that the girl was so frustrated that she stopped going out.

The injured couple was taken to MMG District hospital by locals where doctors declared the woman dead and referred the man to GTB hospital in Delhi. Police said the case was found to be related to dowry harassment. The woman Pooja (23) was a resident of Kallpura area. She married Vikas, an auto-rickshaw driver and a resident of Gukhna, on December 14, 2015, said police. Pooja’s father Surendra Kumar, an e-rickshaw driver, alleged that soon after the marriage, Vikas started demanding a motorcycle and Rs 30,000 from him and when he could not fulfil his demands, the latter started torturing his daughter. “Vikas quarrelled a lot with Pooja over dowry. When the dispute between them increased, I complained about it in the arbitration cell in October 2016. However, soon after that he and Pooja reached a compromise and decided to live away from his parents. On their request, I arranged a rented accommodation for them in Balupura. For the past 18 months till around Raksha Bandhan this year, they had been living together,” said Pooja’s father, adding that after Vikas again started demanding dowry, his daughter started living with her family. Fed up of her husband’s behaviour, she finally filed a divorce case at a local court on October 9, said Kumar. The grieving father disclosed that after the court hearing in the case on Monday Pooja’s lawyer had suggested her to collect her belongings from Vikas’s house for which she had went to Balupura along with her father Omvati. However, as soon as Pooja entered the room, Vikas closed the door, shutting out Omvati. He then stabbed Pooja on her shoulder, waist and throat around 10-15 times before stabbing himself in the stomach and throat with the same knife, said police. Hearing Pooja’s cries Omvati shouted for help after which locals gathered outside the room. The owner of the building, where Vikas lived along with other tenants, then broke opened the door and found the couple lying in a pool of blood. “An FIR will soon be lodged in the case,” said the SHO of Kotwali, Laxman Singh.

VHP also said it would request the Centre to not allow the new mosque-which is to be built on a 5-acre alternative land-to be named Babri Masjid after Babar.  ""Babar was an aakranta (attacker) from a foreign country. We will approach the government to not allow this. There are a lot of good Muslims in India. Their contributions to India's peace and development are huge...such as Vir Abdul Hamid, Ashfaqullah Khan and former President APJ Abdul Kalam. The new mosque should be named after any of them,"" said VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma, who looks after the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas karyashala, where engraved stones for the Ram temple have been kept.

Lucknow,Babri demolition anniversary will be a closed-door affair this time for VHP,"LUCKNOW: For the first time in 27 years, the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition on December 6 will be a low-key affair for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The Sangh outfit has been observing the anniversary as “Shaurya Diwas” and organises yagnas and special prayers for the Ram temple every year. It also pays tributes to kar sevaks who were killed in police firing in 1990 during the then Mulayam Singh Yadav regime.

Lucknow,Muslim community mulls rejecting offer of alternative site for mosque in Ayodhya,"NEW DELHI: With prominent voices joining in, a view is gaining ground within the Muslim community that it should not accept land for building a new mosque anywhere else in Ayodhya. In order to articulate the sentiments of its members and the community, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board will on Sunday spell out its view on the offer of 5 acres of land for a new mosque as per the Supreme Court judgement in the Ram Mandir- Babri Masjid case. The Board at a special meeting of its working committee on Sunday in Lucknow will also decide whether it is in favour of filing a review petition against the judgement or not. While the AIMPLB meeting is being seen among Muslim organisations as critical to put forth a public statement, the fact remains that the decision whether or not to accept the land is going to be the prerogative of the UP Central Sunni Waqf Board. UPCSWB on the day of the judgement issued a statement welcoming the SC verdict and made it cleat that it was not going to file a review petition. UPCSWB was also one of the petitioners in the case. However, the community voices over the way forward have started growing with Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind president Arshad Madani saying, “While it is up to the UPCSWB to take the land or not in my view they should not take it. The reason is that the case was about Babri Masjid and that it existed on the site that was under dispute. It was never about seeking an alternate site. We don’t need five acres land like a compensation. We have lost the case and we accept the top court’s verdict with dignity. However, building a mosque elsewhere does not make any sense to me,” Madani said. A prominent member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Kamal Faruqui, said, “There is a sentiment within the community that the land should not be accepted. I also feel if a new mosque is built at an alternate site it will be a reminder of Babri Masjid and the associated developments ever since it was demolished. Therefore a new mosque should not be built at an alternate site.” Jamaat -e- Islami Hind national secretary Malik Mohtashim Khan too said that there was a sentiment within the community that 5 acres of land should not be accepted by those at the helm of affairs.

Lucknow,A raja’s idea to bridge religious gap shaped Lucknow University,"LUCKNOW: Among the many inspirations behind setting up of LU was one more beautiful than the others. At a time when divisions based on religion were creeping into Indian society, the idea of Lucknow University was thought of to promote communal amity. This led to the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb of Lucknow later playing a significant role in Hindu-Muslim unity during the freedom struggle. It was in 1920 that then Raja of Mahmudabad thought of establishing a university free of communal affiliations. By that time, the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh had been transformed into Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) for imparting education to Muslims youth while before that, in 1916, the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) had been established in Varanasi. “My grandfather Raja Sir Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan (Khan Bahadur, KCIE) of Mahmudabad was the founding vice-chancellor of AMU. However, after serving for some time, he became disillusioned with the concept of having educational institutions on communal names and affiliations. A Muslim university was being run by one system, while a Hindu university had its own set-up. This division, he felt, would later reflect in Indian society. He realised that the university should be a place of equality in opportunities. It gave rise to a desire for an institution free from cultural or religious influences,” said 75-year-old Raja Amir Mohammad Amir Khan, a descendant of Raja of Mahmudabad, narrating how LU was born. ‘Raja Saheb’ then decided to moot the idea of a university in the heart of the state—Lucknow, as it was known for its Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb—where students from all faiths and cultures could get quality education under one roof. With this thought, the Raja contributed an article to a prominent daily newspaper, urging the foundation of a university at Lucknow. The request by him also finds a mention in the first journal of Lucknow University published in 1922. Khan then approached his friend Sir Spencer Harcourt Butler, the first governor of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, to establish a university in Lucknow, the de facto capital of the United Provinces. The idea simultaneously also got support from other taluqdars of the region and together, they all laid the foundation of LU. “The idea of promoting Muslim and Hindu cultures together also found reflection in the efforts of Raja Saheb and Taluqdar friends in courses at LU. They ensured Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit courses under one roof at LU. This allowed students from humble backgrounds or those not from an English-speaking school to get an opportunity to attain higher education in their own language,” he said. "
Lucknow,"UP: Path lab issues wrong dengue report, health department cancels licence","LUCKNOW: Health department on Tuesday cancelled the registration of a private pathology in Keshavnagar for issuing false dengue positive reports. The action came after a health department team conducted surprise inspection and found that though the reports given by the pathology mentioned that dengue test was done through ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), no equipment used for the test was present in the lab. The staff was also found to be unaware of how to use ELISA method for testing samples. The four-member team headed by pathologist Dr Rajesh conducted inspection at around 5 pm after finding discrepancies in dengue positive reports issued by the pathology. “The anomalies in the reports were detected during an audit of patients who died due to dengue in the city. The pathology had issued dengue positive report to a 34-year-old woman who recently died due to high fever,” said Dr KP Tripathi, in charge of vector-borne disease control unit. Chief medical officer Narendra Agarwal said, “An FIR will be lodged against the pathology for endangering public health as the centre may have issued fake reports to other patients as well. If a report is incorrect, it may lead to wrong treatment and death of a patient.” "
Lucknow,"70 years on, Jat king who gave land for AMU gets university in his name","LUCKNOW: Jat king and freedom fighter Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, who leased 3.04 acre land to set up Aligarh Muslim University in 1929 at Rs 2 per year, is set to get a university in his own name close to the institution that he helped set up. In October this year, while campaigning for byelections in Aligarh’s Iglas assembly seat, CM Yogi Adityanath had announced that his government would set up a university in Singh’s name, who despite having made great contributions to AMU, was not being recognised for it. On Monday, UP cabinet cleared the proposal to set up a state university in Aligarh, named after the Jat freedom fighter. “He had given land for the purpose (of establishing the university) but his name has not been mentioned on any plaque,” the CM had said during his election campaign when promising to set up a university in Singh’s name. Singh was an alumnus of the Mohammedan Anglo Oriental College which went on to become AMU. Singh has become a bone of contention between AMU and BJP over the past few years. Not only was there a demand to rename the university after him when a portrait of Pakistan’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah was found hanging on the AMU campus in 2018, but the local BJP wing had also demanded that the university commemorate Singh on his birth anniversary on December 1, 2014. AMU had instead settled on a seminar to honour Singh, with sources saying that the university had more than a 100 donors and it would be impossible to honour each of them on their birth anniversaries. Meanwhile, AMU acknowledges Singh’s contributions on its website. In a programme to celebrate Singh’s birth anniversary in 2016, a person the university refers to as a “freedom fighter and social reformist”, then AMU vice-chancellor Lt General Zameeruddin Shah had said: “Raja Pratap was a proud AMU alumnus, who urged the students to follow footsteps of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and to join the ‘Freedom Movement.’ His family was closely associated with Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of the institution, and they also donated land where AMU’s City School is situated…We have always acknowledged that the Raja did lease 3.04 acres of land to AMU in 1929 at a rate of Rs. 2 per annum and we are proud of his contribution.” "
Lucknow,"GST assessees low, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath sets stiffer target for 2020","LUCKNOW: Expressing dissatisfaction with the low number of tax assessees in state, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the commercial tax department to increase registration of traders to at least 25 lakh and set a target of Rs 1 lakh crore tax collection in the next financial year. He instructed the officials to curb tax theft in pan masala and iron trade, especially in areas neighbouring Nepal and take strict action against tax evaders. Addressing zonal additional commissioners in a review meeting on Tuesday, Yogi expressed displeasure over just 14 lakh traders being registered with the department. He told them to meet the Rs 77,640.10 crore tax collection target for current financial year. He told officials to work in tandem with trader welfare boards and ensure they work in such a way that traders find them to be friendly and not see them as oppressor. The CM asked officials to inform traders about the Rs 10 lakh insurance cover for those registered under GST and the proposed pension scheme for them in future. Proposing measures to increase tax collections, Yogi said, “Felicitate 10 traders of each district who pay the highest GST. Also felicitate the highest tax-paying traders in state on GST Day.” He told the officers to monitor GST collection at district level and stressed on the need to decentralise collection system. Yogi said each zonal additional commissioner must hold a fortnightly review and send report to him. “Deploy good officers in field and monitor their work. If it is unsatisfactory, call them back. This will create a positive image of the department among traders and registration and revenue will increase,” he said. "

Lucknow,"Sikh gurus saved India, religion from being destroyed: Yogi Adityanath","LUCKNOW: Days after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of giving the disputed land at Ayodhya for a temple, chief minister Yogi Adityanath praised Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev as “courageous” for giving Mughal ruler Babar the title of ‘Jabar’ or atrocious. Speaking at a celebration to mark Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary at DAV College in Lucknow, the CM said that when people were reeling under the atrocities of Babar and the country was facing foreign invasions with “religion and truth being destroyed”, Guru Nanak Dev had paved the way for the welfare of humanity through his divine light. “A large section of society was afraid regarding issues of religion, truth and respect for sisters and daughters. Anarchists were a threat to the nation and religion. When the country and religion came under threat, Sikh gurus never bowed or turned back. The sacred tradition of the sacrifice of Sikh gurus is written in golden words in the history of India and every Indian expresses gratitude towards this,” the CM said. Yogi also expressed hope that like Katarpur, Indian Sikhs would soon be able to visit Nankana Sahib as well, the birth place of Guru Nanak in Pakistan. “Woh din door nahi jab Nankana Sahib me bhi hum sab is prakar se jaane me safal honge (The day is not far when we'll be able to visit Nankana Sahib as well).” Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the opening of the Kartarpur corridor, connecting the Sikh shrine of Dera Baba Nanak in India to Darbar Sahib in Pakistan on the occasion of Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary, Yogi said: “It is because of the grace of Guru Nanak Dev that both opening of the Kartarpur corridor and the final Ayodhya verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi happened on the same day.” The SC verdict on November 9 that settled the dispute mentions in its 1,045-page judgement that Guru Nanak had visited Ayodhya for Ram Janmabhoomi ‘darshan’ in 1510-11 AD. This ‘evidence’ had helped strengthen the claim for the temple, it said. Yogi added that no one could forget the contribution of Sikhs in the Indian freedom movement. Schools should organise competitions to teach students about it, he said. As part of the 550th year celebrations, the CM mentioned that work was underway to develop various religious sites associated with Sikhism in the state. "
Ghaziabad,"Delhi-NCR breathes ‘severe’ air again, today may be worse","NEW DELHI: A noxious haze hung over Delhi-NCR on Tuesday as air quality plunged into the “severe” zone again after eight days of relative respite, with experts pointing to a rise in pollution from farm fires and unfavourable weather conditions while warning that pollution could get worse on Wednesday and Thursday. Track the pollution level in your cityThe average AQI in Delhi on Tuesday was 425, a sharp drop from Monday’s 360 (“very poor”). The air was just as toxic in other NCR cities with Ghaziabad recording 453, Noida 440, Faridabad 406, Greater Noida 436 and Gurugram 402 — all in the “severe” category. The 24-hour average PM2.5 and PM10 levels had reached “severe plus” levels, five times above the safe standards, according to CPCB’s data. While Delhi-NCR’s average PM2.5 was 332.8 micrograms per cubic metre at 8pm, the average PM10 concentration was 479.2 micrograms per cubic metre. The “emergency” benchmarks for these pollutants under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) are 300 and 500 micrograms/ cubic metre, respectively, while the safe levels are 60 and 100 micrograms/cubic metre. Air quality unlikely to improve before FridayAccording to SAFAR, no sudden recovery is expected under the present conditions at least for the next two days and AQI is likely to deteriorate further into the severe category. Decrease in temperature, low surface winds and northwest direction of wind, which was bringing in stubble burning emissions from Punjab and Haryana were causing the dip in air quality air, it said. A dip in wind speed and temperature makes the air colder and denser, leading to accumulation of pollutants, a met official said. “The condition may slightly improve by November 15. The effective stubble fire counts have shown a decreasing trend and were recorded at 740 on November 11, but the transport level wind direction is forecast to be highly favourable for plume intrusion for the next two days. The sky is likely to be partly cloudy for the next two days under the influence of an approaching western disturbance but no rain is expected,” a SAFAR report stated. A decreasing trend in the mixing depth and ventilation coefficient is also forecasted for the next two days which will cause the city air to foul up further, the SAFAR report added. Earlier, as pre-emptive steps ahead of the “severe” days, the Supreme Courtmandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority on Monday had said dirty fuel-based industries in Delhi and its suburbs will remain shut till November 14 morning. It also extended the ban on hot-mix plants and stone-crushers in Delhi-NCR till the morning of November 14. This order was based on the Central Pollution Control Board-led graded response action plan task force which reviewed the likely weather conditions in the next 48 hours at a meeting earlier in the day. The maximum and minimum temperatures on Tuesday were 28 degree Celsius, one point below normal for this time of the year, and 11.7 degree Celsius, two notches below normal and the season’s lowest so far. Partly cloudy sky along with shallow fog in the morning hours is expected on Wednesday. The maximum and minimum temperatures would be around 29 and 14 degree Celsius, respectively. "
Lucknow,"New Ayodhya: Saryu cruise, Ram corridor, five-star hotel","LUCKNOW: A cruise on the Saryu, a five-star hotel and heritage hotels, a Ram Corridor. As the Supreme Court verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi dispute on Saturday cleared the way for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, UP government has planned a slew of development projects for the temple town. State culture and tourism departments have plans to invite all states to replicate their respective prominent religious places in Ayodhya and also have their own state residential buildings like ‘Karnataka Bhawan’ or ‘Rajasthan Bhawan’. Sources in the government said rail, air and road connectivity will be developed while creating a “new Ayodhya”, a new township along with construction of the Ram temple to develop the town as among the world’s best pilgrim destinations and attract tourists from world over. Much before the pronouncement by the Supreme Court, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had begun working on renovating and beautifying the town and had approved a Rs 400 crore for this. Principal secretary, tourism and culture, Jitendra Kumar said there was already a surge of investors from India and abroad evincing interest in building big hotels, hospitals, resorts and providing hospitality and service centres in Ayodhya. “Investors have also shown interest in building modern inns and other places to serve pilgrims from outside and saints residing in Ayodhya,” said Kumar. “Culture and tourism departments have drawn up a plan which includes a 13-km long corridor from the Ram temple site to the place where Ram statue is being installed on the banks of Saryu."" Along the corridor, life and times of Lord Ram would be recreated. Other religious sites would also be depicted along the corridor, he said, adding that the proposed project could be named after Lord Ram. The state government is also considering inviting all state governments to set up guest houses on the pattern of those in Delhi and also build models of main religious sites and temples like Somnath in Gujarat and Balaji Mandir in Tirupati. These would be built in Ayodhya, so that tourists visiting the temple will have a glimpse of religious places from across India. ‘Plan for international airport already approved’Rail, road and air traffic routes would be strengthened and expanded to cater to the growing pilgrim and tourist influx. A bus station to accommodate 3,000 to 4,000 buses at a time is being finalised and work on this would start soon once the chief minister approves the plan. Plan for an international airport is already approved for this city,” said Kumar. “The cruise planned on the Saryu, on the lines of Varanasi, will provide a panoramic view of all the attraction, including the Ram temple, Ram corridor and Ram statue.

On Tuesday, the AQI in Noida was recorded at 438, in Greater Noida, it was at 436 and in Ghaziabad, it was 451. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to UPPCB, the spike in the AQI levels is because of an increase in the incidents of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. “There has been a 25% addition in the PM 2.5 category of pollutants from stubble burning over the past 24 hours. In addition to this, there is negligible wind movement. Because of the combination, the AQI has once again shot back to the ‘severe’ category,” said Utsav Sharma, environment engineer, UPPCB, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad.

Lucknow,Varanasi to bid adieu to turtle sanctuary,"LUCKNOW: Three decades after it was declared India’s first and so far only protected area dedicated to the conservation of freshwater turtle species, Varanasi’s Turtle Wildlife Sanctuary is being denotified by the UP government in preparation for a possible “relocation” to the Allahabad-Mirzapur stretch of the Ganga. The prod to denotify the sanctuary first came two years ago, when the Union ministry of environment and forests wrote to the state government that the ghats were under threat. Amid opposition to the move from conservationists, it emerged that the Centre’s 1,620km national waterways project was to pass through the turtle habitat. Sources said the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had conducted a feasibility study and found the Allahabad-Mirzapur stretch of the river suitable for the relocation of the sanctuary. The proposal was “reviewed and approved in principle” during a recent meeting of the state wildlife board, chaired by CM Yogi Adityanath. The sanctuary, spanning the 7km stretch from Ramnagar Fort to the Malviya railroad bridge, was notified as the country’s first freshwater turtle sanctuary under the Ganga Action Plan in 1989. The idea of a sanctuary was married to the concept of releasing four carnivorous species of turtles for organic cleaning of the Ganga. Since Kathawa (Aspederites gangeticus), Sundari Kachua (Lissemys punctata), Dhond (Kachuga dhongoka) and Pacheda (Pangshuratecta) are carnivorous turtles, it was expected that they would feed on half-burnt corpses floating in the waters of the Ganga. Turtle eggs were secured from the Chambal river, hatched at the Sarnath breeding centre and released in the river. The state government subsequently banned sand mining in the area to save the nesting turtles, leading to sand accumulation and increased sedimentation that seemed to create a new set of challenges. Flagging this as a threat to the ghats, the environment ministry wrote to the state government in 2017 seeking a remedy. Since a wildlife sanctuary can only be denotified, Turtle Wildlife Sanctuary will have to be reborn as a new habitat as and when it is shifted. "
Lucknow,Muslim litigant ready to file Ayodhya review petition in SC with AIMPLB support,"LUCKNOW: Days after the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya, Mohammad Umar, son of one of the first Muslim litigants, announced on Wednesday he was ready to file a petition after a nod from the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIPLBM). Talking to TOI from Ayodhya, Umar said alternate land for the mosque outside the acquired 67 acres may not be acceptable. “I am ready to move a review plea, if asked by AIMPLB, which will have to legally back me. We were fighting for Babri mosque, not a piece of land,” said Umar, whose father Mohammad Farooq was one of the first six Muslim litigants in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, along with Hashim Ansari. When asked about his stand on the five acres allotted for the mosque at an alternative site, Umar asked, “Why should the mosque be built away from the site of the demolished Babri masjid? Why should we go somewhere else to offer prayers? Land for the mosque should be given within the acquired site and not beyond,” he said. After the demolition of the Babri masjid, the then Congress government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao passed the “Acquisition of Certain Areas at Ayodhya Act” to acquire 67 acres around the 2.77-acre disputed site where the Babri masjid had stood. Another key litigant, the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, has already announced it won’t go for a review petition and will decide whether to accept the five acres of land soon. AIMPLB member and Babri Masjid Action Committee convenor Zafaryab Jilani had earlier told TOI the board would take a call on the review petition at its November 17 meeting in Nadwatul Ulama. "

While the vehicle sped away, the woman, who suffered limb and back injuries, was helped by passers-by to reach a nearby private hospital from where she was discharged after first aid. “I recently joined college after a month’s leave because my father passed away due to cancer...Now, I might have to discontinue because my mother and sisters are scared about my safety,” she added. SHO BKT Amarnath Verma said, “We are trying to identify the driver through CCTV footage.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)"
Lucknow,Smriti Smriti chides DM for shoving slain BJP man’s brother,"LUCKNOW: Union minister Smriti Irani on Wednesday chided Amethi district magistrate on twitter after a video showing him roughing up the brother of a slain BJP worker went viral on social media. Irani represents Amethi in Lok Sabha. Amethi DM Prashant Sharma, a 2012 batch IAS officer, entered into a verbal duel with Sunil Singh, a PCS trainee officer, brother of BJP worker Vijay Kumar Singh alias Sonu, who was shot dead in Amethi on Tuesday over extortion. Sunil was protesting against the delay in post-mortem and nabbing Sonu’s killers. In the two-and-half minute video, Sharma is seen shoving Sunil and lecturing protesters on not to over-react and seek instant results. “Is zile ka sabse varishth adhikari yahan khada hai. Kya aapko pata hai us aadmi ke paas katta hai ke nahi? (The district’s most senior officer is standing here. Can you show if that man has a firearm?” asks Sharma.  Irani tagged the DM in her tweet saying, “Vinaysheel evam samvedansheel banein hum, yahi prayaas hona chahiye. Janata ke hum sevak hain, shaasak nahi @DmAmethi. (We should always try to be humble and caring. We are here to serve people not to rule.)” This was the second controversy involving Sharma in last one week. Sharma had come late for hearing before the Lucknbow bench of Allahabad high court. Despite repeated attempts, Amethi SP Khyati Garg did not respond to calls and messages to confirm if the district police has received any complaint against Sharma. The Amethi Police has registered a case of murder against three unidentified people in Gauriganj. Sonu Singh, owner of a brick kiln, was shot dead allegedly over extortion demand of Rs 2 lakh barely 500 m away from the SP’s office in Amthi at around 7pm on Tuesday. Sonu’s father Shivnayak Singh is also a local leader of BJP. Sonu’s brother Arpit Kumar Singh had accused Chandrashekhar Kesarwani, Shubham Tiwari and three unidentified persons in the complaint filed at Gauriganj police station after which an FIR was lodged.

Lucknow,Seized documents put former PCL boss AP Mishra in dock,"LUCKNOW: The findings of probe in violation of government rules while investing employees’ provident fund reveal that Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited managing director, A P Mishra, played a key role in it as money was put in financial institutions other than scheduled commercial banks for the first time in December 2016. The scrutiny of documents seized from UPPCL headquarters at Shakti Bhawan on November 4 by UP Police’s Economic Offences Wing till now has revealed that bending of rules in PF investment started under Mishra in December 2016. Officials privy to the probe said prior to investment of UPPCL employees’ PF in DHFL in March 2017, the UP power sector employees trust and UPPCL authorities had invested Rs 50 crore from contributory provident fund and Rs 50 crore from general provident fund in PNB Housing and LIC. EOW officials on Wednesday said they have traced the money trail of four of the 14 brokerage firms that secured the deal between UPPCL and DHFL. The officials said DHFL has agreed to co-operate and disclose the commission percentage given to brokerage firms. “Transactions have also taken place between these four brokerage firms and UPPCL officials and are being probed,” said a senior official. EOW had started investigation of the anomalies on November 3 and has so far arrested Mishra, UPPCL director (finance) Sudhanshu Dwivedi and general manager (finance) PK Gupta.

Lucknow,75% infant deaths take place in the first month of birth in UP,"LUCKNOW: Over 75% infant mortality cases in UP clock deaths in the first 28 days itself. The tragedy is compounded by the fact that majority deaths are linked to preventable causes and at least 41 of 1000 babies die before celebrating their first birthday. An internal assessment by the state health department found pre-term births accounted for about 44% deaths and these are linked to poor health and anaemia in expectant mothers. Neonatal infections (20%) picked up from labour rooms or caused by lack of basic hygiene by lower-rung health staff and parents was the next big reason. Acknowledging the need to spread awareness on factors that lead to neonatal deaths, National Health Mission would observe Neonatal Awareness Week between November 14 and 21. Mission director, NHM, UP Pankaj Kumar said, “the most crucial time to connect with a newborn is the first 28 days when the infant is vulnerable to different life-threatening diseases.” Experts agree. “If the baby survives in this period, UP’s infant mortality rate can be halved,” said Dr Vishwajeet Kumar, social entrepreneur and founder, Community Empowerment Lab dedicated to saving newborns.

Lucknow,"Don’t burn crop stubble, convert it into biofuel: CM Yogi Adityanath","LUCKNOW: With air quality over north India deteriorating once again, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has appealed to farmers to not burn crop residue but instead use it to increase soil productivity. The CM announced that the government was exploring the opportunity to convert crop residue into fuel and at some point in future, could even purchase it from farmers. “Crop stubble can be converted to biofuel. We are already in talks with companies like Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum and are setting up a unit each in Sitapur and Gorakhpur for this. Once these are up and running and successful, we will strive to have one or two such units in each district. In coming days we can then purchase crop residue from farmers,” the CM said. Farm fires in rice producing states of UP, Haryana and Punjab have been identified as a major cause of air pollution. Several cities in UP where air pollution is being monitored have shown extremely high levels of harmful particulate matter. Addressing farmers during the launch of an e-portal for sugarcane growers on Wednesday, Yogi said burning stubble decreases the productivity of soil and adversely impacts environment. “I appeal to all farmers that stubble should not be burnt. Instead, if you crush it and use it while turning the soil, it will turn into compost. Use it for anything else but don’t burn it. Burning releases dangerous gases,” he said. He added that with the government promoting sugarcane production and opening more sugar mills in UP, sugarcane leaves would also be generated as “waste” but instead of being burnt, they could be used for maintaining moisture in the soil for the next sugarcane crop.

Lucknow,Lucknow as noisy as vacuum cleaner near you: Experts,"LUCKNOW: It is not just the air of Lucknow that is unfit for breathing, even noise pollution levels in the city are alarmingly high, posing a risk to health of people. Track the pollution level in your cityA study by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) has found that day and night noise levels across Lucknow are 24-40% higher than the permissible limit set by National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). These noise levels are equivalent to a vacuum cleaner running constantly near you. Prolonged exposure to such noise can damage ear drums and cause hypertension in people, said experts. Primary reasons for high noise levels were vehicular movement and construction activities, they added. Aliganj was the noisiest place during the day with 69.5 decibels, 25% higher than permissible limit. Indiranagar, with 64.8 decibels, was the noisiest at night. This was 44% higher than permissible limit. Aliganj recorded 62.8 decibels at night while Indiranagar recorded 67.4 decibels during the day. Noise level in Gomtinagar was 68.7 decibels during day and 60.1 decibels at night. For Vikasnagar, it was 65.9 decibels in the day and 58.9 decibels at night. Among commercial areas, Charbagh was the noisiest both during the day and night with 77.2 decibels and 68.9 decibels, respectively. Chowk was the second noisiest during the day and Aminabad at night.

Lucknow,Gomtinagar gasped in worst October air,"LUCKNOW: People living in Gomtinagar and Charbagh breathed in the most polluted air in October in the city, reveals the post-monsoon ambient air quality assessment report released by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) on Wednesday. Track the pollution level in your cityThe main reason for pollution was found to be dust raised by plying of vehicles on broken roads, open garbage burning and vehicular emissions. In the survey, air pollution levels in October were monitored at nine locations—four residential ones being Aliganj, Vikasnagar, Indiranagar and Gomtinagar, four commercial ones being Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad and Chowk and one industrial area being Amausi. Among residential areas, Gomtinagar had the highest average PM10 concentration at 165.4micrograms per cubic metre of air (g/m3), almost double the permissible limit of 100g/m3. This was followed by Indiranagar, Vikasnagar and Aliganj. Gomtinagar also topped in PM2.5 concentration with 93.6g/m3 followed by Indiranagar, Aliganj and Vikasnagar. All values were above the permissible limit of 60g/m3. Among commercial areas, Charbagh recorded the highest PM10 concentration of 197.4g/m3, followed by Aminabad, Alambagh and Chowk. Similarly, PM2.5 concentration was highest in Charbagh with 109.6g/m3 followed by Chowk and Alambagh. Citing a study by UP Pollution Control Board last year which cited broken roads, open garbage burning and vehicular emissions as main sources of air pollutants in the city, experts said that unless these activities are not corrected with seriousness, no improvement in conditions could be expected. The areas found most polluted in the report are those where either vehicular load is high or many stretches are lying broken or garbage is burnt in the open. Dust particles released by construction activities have been the major factor of air pollution in expanding Gomtinagar where a number of residential, government and commercial construction projects are underway. Charbagh, on the other hand, witnesses heavy vehicular load daily. Similar factors in various degrees can be found in other residential and commercial areas. “The weather also plays an important role in air pollution. For example, wind speed can blow away pollutants hanging in the atmosphere and rains can clear the air, but the real solution would be to reduce the source of pollution,” said senior scientist SC Barman who led the IITR team.

Lucknow,Digital signatures on Lucknow University marksheets to cut fakes,"LUCKNOW: To check fake documents, the Lucknow University has decided that all marksheets uploaded on its website will now bear digital signatures. Moreover, students will get only three years after passing out to get their marksheets corrected after which a go ahead will be required from the examination controller and the vice-chancellor. The decisions were taken during the examination committee meeting on Wednesday. It examination committee decided that marksheets will be made available to students within 10 days of declaration of results. The practice of giving physical copy of the marksheet to students and uploading of documents online will continue. However, the online version will have digital signatures. The students will be given 10 days to apply for corrections, if any, after which marksheets with digital signatures will be uploaded on the website. If the students are not able to get corrections done within 10 days for some reason, they can get special permission by applying within three years of passing out. However, if any request is allowed after three years, the candidate will have to seek the approval of controller of examination and vice-chancellor who will have to mention, in writing, the circumstances under which approval is being given. “In the name of corrections, many marksheets keep on lying in university’s examination cell for years. Tabulation charts are taken out for correction but not put back which increases risk of misuse like making of fake marksheets,” said officiating vice-chancellor SK Shukla. "
Lucknow,"Why Sanskrit, Persian will forever illuminate Lucknow University","LUCKNOW: Envisioned as a centre of multi-culturalism, Lucknow University has been a place to learn languages since its inception. Besides science and humanities subjects, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit and Persian were among the first 28 departments set up in 1921, when LU it began its journey. These departments were clubbed under different faculties. With time, many new departments were added. The departments of Latin and Greek, though, had to shut after just a year due to a fall in popularity. However, it is a bond signed with the founding fathers that has ensured that the departments of Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian continue to impart knowledge despite a decline in demand. According to the bond—the Taluq-e-Daran-e-Awadh—signed in 1922, the university will have to run traditional courses in Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit till the time it exists. It was signed at the time when land for constructing the university was donated by Sir Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan, the then Raja of Mahmudabad estate. The sentiment behind the bond was that these subjects reflected the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb enshrined in Lucknow’s culture. “This is the reason why teaching in classical Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian in the traditional manner using unabridged books still continues in LU,” said Ayodhya Das Shri Vishnu, former head of the department of oriental studies in Sanskrit. “By teaching these subjects, we are keeping our traditions alive and connect the past with the present,” said Prof Syed Arshad Ali Jafari, a faculty of oriental studies in Arabic and Persian and an alumnus of LU. The Taluq-e-Daran-e-Awadh also arranged for some waqf properties to fund these departments. As a result, no fee was charged from the students. This, however, changed in 2007, when then vice-chancellor RP Singh issued directions to charge fees to deter non-serious candidates from taking admission. “In 2007, the fee was increased from a meagre Rs 350 to Rs 3,000,” which became the main reason for the drop in the number of applications,” said Das. LU alumnus and Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University VC Manoj Dixit said, “These courses are very unique to India and LU was the first, at least in North India, to start them. Insufficient work on syllabus, not updating it, and not making the courses job-oriented can be seen as reasons for the dip in demand.” "
Lucknow,Ayodhya Muslim litigant ready to file review plea,"LUCKNOW: Days after the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya, murmurs are getting louder among Muslims to seek review of the judgment. On Wednesday, Mohammad Umar, son of one of the first Muslim litigants, announced he was ready to file a petition after a nod from All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIPLBM), an apex body of the community. Talking to TOI from Ayodhya, Umar said alternate land for the mosque outside the acquired 67 acre may not be acceptable. ""I am ready to move a review plea, if asked by AIMPLB, which will have to legally back me. We were fighting for Babri mosque, not a piece of land,"" said Umar, whose father Mohammad Farooq was one of the first six Muslim litigants in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, along with Hashim Ansari. When asked about his stand on the 5-acre land allotted for the mosque as an alternative site, Umar asked, ""Why should the mosque be built away from the site of the demolished Babri Masjid? Why should we go somewhere else to offer prayers? Land for the mosque should be given within the acquired site and not beyond,"" he said. After the Babri demolition, then Congress government under Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao passed the 'Acquisition of Certain Areas at Ayodhya Act' to acquire 67 acre around the 2.77 acre disputed site where Babri Masjid once stood. Another key litigant, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, has already announced it would won't go for a review petition and would decide on accepting the 5-acre land soon. AIMPLB member and convener of Babri Masjid Action Committee, Zafaryab Jilani, had earlier told TOI the Board will take a call on the review petition in its November 17 meeting in Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow. He also said the board can explore the option of seeking a review through five Muslim litigants and three other Muslim defendants in the Ayodhya case. Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind (JuH), which is also a party in the case, will be meeting in Delhi on Thursday on the issue. ""A final call will be taken by the governing council meeting of JuH on Thursday on twin issues of review and alternate 5-acre land,"" said JuH's state chief, Maulana Ashhad Rashidi. "

Ghaziabad,"Air emergency in Delhi-NCR, schools shut till Friday","NEW DELHI: Air quality in Delhi-NCR plunged deeper into the “severe” zone on Wednesday, staying in the worst category on the AQI scale for the second straight day, which prompted the authorities to take “air emergency” action. Schools in Delhi and adjoining cities were ordered shut till Friday while CM Arvind Kejriwal said he would consider extending the odd-even scheme beyond November 15.Track the pollution level in your city“In view of deteriorating air quality because of pollution due to stubble burning, the Delhi government has decided to close schools tomorrow and day after,” deputy CM Manish Sisodia tweeted.Similar announcements were made in Noida, Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Faridabad after the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority wrote to NCR states recommending the move and advised people to avoid outdoor exposure and work from home wherever feasible.The average air quality index in Delhi on Wednesday was 456 — the third highest so far this season — deteriorating from Tuesday’s 425.No respite today, ‘severe’ air may improve to ‘very poor’ after 2 daysAir quality remained severe in NCR towns as well. It was 470 in Noida, 446 in Faridabad, 467 in Ghaziabad, 462 in Greater Noida and 447 in Gurugram. A toxic smog hung over much of north India with cloudy skies over Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh as well as calm winds ahead of an approaching western disturbance trapping pollutants close to the ground.In NCR, the 24-hour average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in the air crossed severe plus levels — five times above the safe standards on Wednesday — according to CPCB’s central control room data. While the average PM2.5 was 348.2 micrograms per cubic metre at 9pm, the average PM10 concentration was 506.6 micrograms per cubic metre. The “emergency” benchmark for these pollutants under GRAP is 300 and 500 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, while the safe standards are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre.The CPCB-led task force met to review the situation and recommended the shutting down of schools for the next two days. It also extended the ban on hot-mix plants and stone-crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 15.

In Delhi, industries which have not yet shifted to piped natural gas, will not operate during the period.“Low surface winds, low mixing depth and contribution from farm fires due to northwesterly winds resulted in the severe plus category, which is likely to continue till Thursday,” an India Meteorological Department official said. “Strong winds are expected from November 15, which will bring down the air pollution levels to the very poor category,” he added.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in view of the situation, the odd-even road rationing scheme could be extended beyond November 15.“If the need arises, we will extend the odd-even scheme,” Kejriwal said in response to media queries on whether the initiative aimed at curbing vehicular pollution will be extended. The scheme, implemented from November 4, is to end on November 15.Earlier on November 1, the Delhi government had ordered closure of all schools till November 5 after the EPCA declared a public health emergency in Delhi-NCR due to a harmful spike in pollution after Diwali. According to SAFAR, the AQI is likely to deteriorate during Wednesday night and stay in the severe category on Thursday.“The air quality condition is likely to marginally improve by November 15 but reasonable improvement to ‘very poor’ is expected only by November 16. The stubble fire counts has shown decreasing trend (480 counts on November 12). Hence, a decline in biomass share in Delhi’s air quality is estimated as 13% for November 14 in spite of favourable transport level wind trajectory,” it said.The approaching fresh Western Disturbance exists as a cyclonic circulation over Afghanistan and neighbourhood and is likely to affect northwest India in the next two days, which is likely to increase wind speed at Delhi by November 15, the report stated."

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad sees three houses on average getting burgled every day,"GHAZIABAD: Be wary about how you lock your house as there are chances that you might be the next target for thieves on the prowl in Ghaziabad. Over the last few years, the district has witnessed a rising number of thefts. According to police data, while 492 cases were reported in 2015 the figure increased to 760 in 2018. However, in 2019, the number skyrocketed. Between January and October this year, 975 cases of theft have already been reported, meaning more than three cases (on average) every day. The police said that this year, they have arrested 55 thieves from the district and sent them to jail. Officials said around 30% of the theft cases were lodged by residents of highrise apartments while the rest of them came from independent houses, colonies and factories. Around 20% of cases were lodged against the house helps or other staffers, the cops said. In the 2,383 cases of theft that were reported between 2015 and 2018, assets worth over Rs 1 crore were stolen. “A number of crimes can be avoided if residents are vigilant and proactive about them. People should install CCTV cameras around their houses and when they go out, they should properly lock their homes,” a senior cop said. In 2018, former SP (city) Shlok Kumar had issued guidelines to apartment owners associations (AOAs) and RWAs to strengthen their security mechanism. Besides, residents also have the option to install anti-theft devices in their flats. Sudhir Kumar Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ghaziabad, told TOI that the cases of theft have gone down in the last two months as police have arrested several criminals. “Nowadays, it is very easy to enter any house on the pretext being a worker, a house help and more. So police verification is very important for these things. The police verification forms can be filed online,” Singh said. Police said that patrolling, especially during the night has been enhanced, but AOAs and RWAs should come forward and plug the gaps in their society’s security. “I have formed a team at every police station to keep an eye on suspicious persons. The teams also check the vendors and workers who work in highrises,” he added. Among the prominent theft cases in Ghaziabad is the one that took place in August. Four persons, including the driver of a businessman, were arrested for allegedly stealing cash and jewellery worth Rs 1.2 crore from his Kavi Nagar house. The family was out for dinner when the incident took place. Along with cash and jewellery, a licensed pistol of the businessman’s brother was also stolen. ADG (Meerut zone) Prashant Kumar said it was the biggest recovery in the zone in the past two years. "

On Thursday, 42 stretches across Noida were cleared of dust with help of machines. An increase in wind speed is forecast by Saturday which is likely to increase ventilation and improve the air quality towards “very poor”, a SAFAR report stated, adding that the air may clear further by Sunday. A Met official said the wind speed on Thursday was very low, 5-6km per hour, which was not allowing dispersion of pollutants.“Partly cloudy sky, too, is adding to the low visibility which was 600-800 metres in Delhi on Thursday. From Friday evening, however, wind speed is expected to pick up. On November 16-17, 20-25km per hour surface winds are expected and the air quality will improve,” the official told TOI. According to the SAFAR experts, the effective stubble fire counts estimated as per satellites are only 69 on November 13 under dense cloudy conditions when satellite capability to detect is questionable. “Considering the PM2.5 deficit, fire emissions appear to be higher and fresh biomass contribution is around 13%. However, due to lack of dispersion and very low mixing height, the sustainable cumulative impact of stubble intrusion on Thursday is estimated to be more than 30%.” According to Met officials, due to an approaching fresh western disturbance and induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan, which has started to affect northwest India, scattered rainfall is expected over Punjab. “This is likely to lead to very low fire count during the next two days. The stubble transport level wind direction is not so favourable for intrusion of the crop burning emission into Delhi. Therefore, stubble contribution is estimated to reduce significantly by tomorrow to around 5%,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, the SC-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority wrote to the NCR states, and ordered schools to be shut on Thursday and Friday, and advised people to avoid outdoor exposure and work from home wherever feasible.

Ghaziabad,"NHAI, railways flout graded plan, fined","GHAZIABAD: A private builder and one of the contractors of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) were fined Rs 1.01 crore each by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) for carrying out construction work despite a blanket ban on such activities by the Supreme Court. The NHAI was also fined Rs 1 lakh for violating the ban. Indian Railways has been fined Rs 11 lakh for carrying out construction work on a railway bridge in Indirapuram. UPPCB is also considering legal action against NHAI. “The penalties have not deterred NHAI from carrying out construction work. On two occasions in the past, we had imposed penalties of Rs 90 lakh and Rs 26 lakh on NHAI but it did not stop its work. We are now exploring ways to prosecute the highway authority,” said UPPCB regional officer Utsav Sharma. During a joint inspection by Sharma and additional district magistrate (city) Shailendra Kumar Singh on Thursday, construction activity was found taking place near Kanawani Pusta road by NHAI’s contractor APCO. A fine of Rs 1 crore was imposed on the infrastructure company for violating the norms of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), while Rs 1 lakh was levied for not following the SC directive on construction. Nine persons working at the site were also detained.

Lucknow,Alternative land not acceptable for mosque in Ayodhya: Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind,"LUCKNOW: Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind (JuH), a key Muslim litigant in the Ayodhya title suit, has decided not to accept the 5-acre alternative land for building a mosque as mandated by the Supreme Court. After its working committee meeting in Delhi on Thursday, the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind said that nothing would be acceptable as an “alternative” to a mosque, be it money or land. In another big decision, JuH did not rule out the possibility of going for a review of the Supreme Court verdict. A five-member fact-finding committee to be headed by its president, Arshad Madani, would seek legal opinion on the issue. Ayodhya verdict: Complete coverage“Two crucial decisions were taken in the working committee meeting. One pertained to the five-acre alternative land for a mosque and the other possibility of filing a review plea. The working committee unanimously decided there can be no ‘badal’ (alternative) of a mosque for anything in the world. Neither money nor land,” said UP chief of JuH, Maulana Ashhad Rashidi, who was present in the meeting. ‘Won’t be right for any Muslim outfit to accept a barter’It won’t be right for any other Muslim organisation to accept a barter,” he said. On the question of the review petition, Maulana Rashidi told TOI, “A committee of five members headed by Arshad Madani will in a couple of days go through court documents and seek legal opinion from JuH’s own lawyers and other Supreme Court lawyers to get a perspective before taking the next step.” Founded in 1919, Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind is one of the most influential and financially sustainable Muslim organisations in the country that completed 100 years in India. It was an active member of the Khilafat movement and freedom struggle, while also opposing Partition. Read this story in Bengali"
Lucknow,Lucknow: Missing girl found rotting in thickets,"LUCKNOW: The decomposed body of a 10-year-old girl missing for a week was found in the bushes around 200 meters from her home in Gosainganj on Thursday. The body was infested with maggots and her left foot was missing. The parents of the girl had last seen her playing outside their home on November 8. Though family members and neighbours had alleged sexual assault, the autopsy report did not confirm it. The report, however, said that the cause of death was strangulation. The father of the girl owns a meat shop while her three elder brothers are daily wagers. According to police, locals found the body on agricultural land around 7am, but were not able to identify it as it was decomposed. As they knew that a girl was missing from a house in the neighbourhood, they informed the girl’s family. The elder brother (22) of the girl identified the body from her red dress and her height. The left foot of the girl seemed to be eaten away by an animal. The family then informed the police which sent the body for postmortem examination and started scanning the area for evidence and quizzed locals. The elder brother of the girl said, “We do not have enmity with anyone in the village who could have possibly done this to take revenge. I had found an old knife near the body and informed police about it”. In the police complaint on Saturday, the girl’s mother had said that she had seen her playing outside her home around 9am. “Later, locals told us that they saw her crying near a house outside the village. They also said they saw her going towards her house,” said Gosainganj sub-inspector Rajendra Verma. SSP Lucknow Kalanidhi Naithani said, “The postmortem examination report states that the girl died about a week ago due to strangulation. Evidence of sexual assault was not found in the report.” "

Lucknow,Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma to monitor UP Board exams on phone,"LUCKNOW: After a crackdown on the copying menace in the past two academic sessions in UP Board examination, the government is set to develop a digital system to monitor the process. Under the new system, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma will watch the examination process on his smartphone and issue instructions as needed. Sharma, who also has the charge of secondary as well as higher education ministries, would not need to inspect the examination control room of UP Secondary Education Board March 2020 onwards. Through an app, the control room will take live feed from all 8,700 examination centres in the state and that will be streamed on the smartphone of the minister. If any copying attempt is made, immediate action will follow. No state has developed such e-monitoring or a control room for every examination centre through internet and CCTV cameras to check copying, Sharma said. With over 70 lakh students taking the exams in classes X and XII, UPSEB is among the world's largest examination bodies. However, copying mafia and mass copying have tainted the image of the state's board examination. To check the menace, the government has mandated CCTV cameras with internet connection for all examination centres. Any centre not having the facilities would be denied permission for the exams, Sharma said. With the new system in place, the minister hoped that UP Board exams would be free of the copying menace.

Lucknow,"Cops ran up food bills of Rs 17 lakh, never paid up: Eatery owners","GHAZIABAD: The image of the authoritarian cop throwing his weight around while those around scramble to appease him is an all too familiar one. In Ghaziabad, a group of eatery owners decided to put an end to this narrative of “extortion”. “Around Diwali, the station house officer of every police station in the district held meetings with the owners of restaurants and hotels, telling them that encroachment and parking violations would lead to strong action. Just a day after that, eatery owners started getting calls from police officers in every police station, ordering more than 100 packs of sweets and the same number of dry fruit packs,” said Anil Kumar Gupta, the president of the Association of Food Operators in Ghaziabad. There are 17 police stations in Ghaziabad. The Association of Food Operators alleged every police officer ran up bills of Rs 1-1.5 lakh. Initially, Gupta said, the police officers said that they would pay the bills but when they were asked for the money later, they threw their weight around and threatened them about encroachment and parking. “Then they came with families and friends for lunch and dinner, and never paid those bills either,” he added. For most eatery owners, they said, the sequence of events is not unfamiliar. “Restaurant and hotel owners are harassed by police at every level all the time. They often ask that the food they order be provided free of cost or at half price,” Gupta said. What is not familiar, though, is the scale. And eatery owners decided to resist it this time. The Association of Food Operations has more than 150 members in Ghaziabad. Gupta wrote a letter to the SSP, Ghaziabad, complaining about the harassment he and his colleagues have been subjected to – the letter went viral. It was not just the police, though, he said. “The fire officer did the same, threatening to obstruct the fire NOC for restaurants and hotels should anyone press for payment of dues,” Gupta added. The association has planned to go meet the SSP about this. “If the SSP fails to do anything, I will take the complaint to police in Lucknow and the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, asking them to get our bills paid,” Gupta added. But the SSP, Sudhir Kumar Singh, on his part, has already taken note of the complaints. “An investigation will be conducted by a senior officer. We are yet to receive the letter (of complaint) but I have already asked all station house officers to pay up the money immediately or else action will be taken,” he said. Taking the onus of redress upon himself, he added, “The vendors can send bills directly to my office, with the name of the police officer. The bill will be paid by the concerned officer and I will initiate action against the officer.” In fact, from now on, eatery owners can get in touch with the SSP directly in case they face this kind of harassment again. “I have issued a notice to this effect. I will also call the association members and ask for evidence against the errant officers. Otherwise, the officers may end up taking action against them,” he added. "

Lucknow,Government fund sought for Hindon flights to three UP cities,"GHAZIABAD: The district administration plans to seek Viability Gap Funding (VGF) from the UP government for starting flights from Hindon to Prayagraj, Lucknow and Varanasi airports as these routes do not fall under the regional connectivity scheme (RCS). The district magistrate has sought a proposal from Indigo, Heritage Aviation and Star Air in this regard. Currently, the Star Air flights to and from Hubballi in Karnataka are the only ones operating out of Hindon airport. Under the RCS scheme, a certain amount of VGF, or financial support, is provided to participating carriers to meet the gap, if any, between the cost of operations and expected revenues on the routes. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said the Airport Authority of India (AAI) has informed the administration that if any airline wants to start flights to these places, it will have to seek permission from Hindon Air Force base and Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL). If the state government agrees to provide 100% VGF, these routes could be included in the next round of bidding, he added. Pandey said, “The airports of Lucknow, Allahabad (Prayagraj) and Varanasi do not fall under the purview of the regional connectivity scheme, Udan (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), so only commercial flights could be allowed to operate at these places. During a meeting, I sought a proposal from Indigo, Heritage Aviation and Star Air for the flight service to the three UP districts.” “Afterwards, I will write to the state government for 100% VGF. In the next step, permission from Hindon Air Force base and DIAL will be required by the airline,” he added. The Hindon airport started functioning last month, when Heritage Airlines started a six-day flight service to Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand. But flight operations were suspended twice. They will now resume from November 16. Pandey said the airlines had informed that a periodical inspection of the aircraft has been completed and flights can be operated without any interruption for the next four months. Heritage Aviation officials have also been asked to explore the feasibility of starting services to Gulbarga in Karnataka and Jamnagar in Gujarat. The proposal is in the preliminary stage, the DM said. "

Lucknow,"26 years ago, former Ram Lalla priest was shot dead","LUCKNOW: Exactly 26 years ago on this day, Baba Lal Das, the former chief priest of Ram Janmabhoomi temple, who articulated the view that the Ram mandir issue should be settled locally instead of being made a national political issue, was murdered at his village Ranipur Chaltar, 20 km from Ayodhya. A witness in the Babri Masjid demolition case and hailed as a beacon of peace between Hindus and Muslims of Faizabad and Ayodhya, the murder of Baba Lal Das was suspected by many as political foul play. However, a CBI probe held that it was the result of a land dispute. “Baba Lal Das was a revolutionary seer. He blasted those who used the Ram temple issue politically,” said Yugal Kishore Shastri, mahant of the ancient Saryu Kunj temple in Ayodhya, a former district general secretary of VHP. Das was the court-appointed chief priest of the Ram Lalla idol inside the Babri Masjid from 1983. He was removed from the post in March 1992 on allegations of corruption. He was shot on November 16, 1993 at his village in Basti district and the murder was claimed to be over land dispute. Seers and residents of Ayodhya approached both the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and then state chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav for CBI investigation. The CBI took over the case in 1994 and chargesheeted two for murder over land. One of the accused was sentenced to life imprisonment. “Police records in the case had found involvement of Baba Lal Das’s son in the case. He was the one who had filed the FIR and had named an accused, but he was also put under CBI investigation,” a senior intelligence officer privy to the case told TOI. Shastri, who had a sweet-sour relationship with Baba Lal Das, said the temple priest had a ‘leftist’ ideology and had also kept the photograph of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh with him inside the central dome of the Babri Masjid. “He had held a press meet in Ayodhya as the then Ram Lalla priest dissuading LK Advani from embarking on his Rath Yatra,"" Shastri added. “He was a CBI witness in the Babri Masjid demolition case and had spoken against the demolition publicly on that day too,” said M Narayanan, retired CBI official who was the CBI SP at the time of the case. “But the murder was a different angle. Even his family was taken under the ambit of suspicion and one accused was given a life term. The reason was found to be land dispute and nothing else,” he added. "

Lucknow,UP ATS picks up former Army officer from Hyderabad in Kushinagar mosque blast,"LUCKNOW/HYDERABAD/GORAKHPUR: Three days after stacked explosives blew up in a mosque in Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh, a former Major with the Indian Army, Dr Ashfaq Alam, was picked up from Hyderabad Old City by UP Anti-Terrorist Squad (UPATS) and flown to Lucknow on Friday, en route to Kushinagar for interrogation. The blast took place in Bairagi Patti village under Turk Patti police station area of the district on Monday. The doctor was interrogated before being taken into custody late Friday, taking the arrest count to six. Samples from the blast site have been sent to Agra forensic lab for zeroing in on nature of explosives. Dr Alam served in the Army Medical Corps till 2017 before taking voluntary retirement to prepare for civil services examination. He was picked up around 9am on Thursday in a joint operation of UPATS and Counter-Intelligence, Telangana police from his East Janaki Nagar residence in Golconda area of Hyderabad. Dr Alam, who was present in Kushinagar at the time of blast, is accused of conniving with five other accused for tampering with evidence and criminal conspiracy among other charges. The doctor is the grandson of one of the key accused, Haji Qutubuddin, a resident of the village who would frequent the mosque to offer namaz. Qutubuddin is charged with stashing explosives in the bag. Alam’s wife too is a doctor in the Army and is posted in Hyderabad. “Dr Alam called up police about an explosion in a mosque, citing short-circuit in the invertor’s battery. When police arrived at the spot, the doctor had fled along with his grandfather, Haji Qutubuddin,” said additional director-general of police (ATS) Dhruva Kant Thakur.

Lucknow,"After Ayodhya, thrust on 5-star hotels in Sarnath and Kushinagar","LUCKNOW: At a time when SC has cleared the way for construction of the Ram Temple following the order on title dispute in Ayodhya, luxury hotel groups across India have sought Centre’s assistance in exploring UP’s Buddhist sites to tap into tourists from neighbouring South Asian countries. Three big five star hotels, including one led by the Oberoi Group have made a dash to Niti Ayog, which on Friday approached UP government to help the firms promote tourism around Sarnath and Kushinagar. The government roped in UP tourism department hours after Niti Ayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, who on a visit to meet UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked for the development of Buddhist circuit. The Oberoi Group wants to set up its hotel on a minimum 20-acre land in Sarnath, where Gautam Buddha is believed to have delivered his first sermon apart from the Four Noble Truths, the middle path and eightfold path. “We have conveyed the request for Sarnath to Varanasi DM. Besides, we also have a landbank in Kushinagar, where Buddha attained parinirvana after his death. Since we have shelved the Maitreyi plan, we have a pool of 200 acres to assist any potential hospitality firm willing to set up shop here,” said principal secretary (culture) Jitendra Kumar. The government sources said that private hospitality firms also insist that they want to tap South Asian tourist influx into UP via Nepal border, saying casino shops and resorts by Chinese, Myanmar and Japanese companies on the borders have always been popular vacation spots among tourists, but lack of accomodation in the Hindi heartland was a deterrent to the development of tourism industry. The UP government may also approach Nepal government to seek a common visa entry point at Lumbini for Buddhist pilgrims. Government officials said that an international airport is already coming up at Siddarth Nagar district in UP, 20 km from Lumbini. At present, Lucknow, Varanasi, Agra and Noida are the only districts where five star hotels exist. "

FedAOA founder Alok Kumar said, “I am suggesting the police to conduct a quiz and debate programmes in schools, the winner of which will be appointed as in-charge of a police station for a day.” “A few girl students will be selected from across all the schools of the district on a set of criteria and they will be given training on policing in the state. Apart from this, they will also be educated on crime against women and actions to be taken in such cases. Once the training is completed, a counselling session will be done by senior police officers who will then appoint the students as in-charge of a police station for one day,” Kumar added. The police department is also working on the criteria on which the students will be selected. SP (city) Manish Kumar Mishra said, “We are hoping to plan out the criteria for selection within a week and start this program by the end of November.” "
Lucknow,Passengers to zip between Delhi &amp; Meerut in 55 minutes,"LUCKNOW: As Uttar Pradesh is set to become the first state to get rapid rail transport system (RRTS), the 82-km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor will be the first to become operational. Construction on 17-km section between Sahibabad and Duhai has started which will become operational by March 2023, while commercial operations on the entire stretch will commence by 2025. A presentation on RRTS was made at the 12th edition of Urban Mobility India conference and expo held in Lucknow on Friday. Chief public relations officer, National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), Sudhir Kumar Sharma said: “The corridor will be the key to new economic opportunities for sustainable economic development of NCR.” The corridor will have 24 stations – either elevated or underground – originating from Sarai Kale Khan RRTS station in Delhi and ending at Modipuram in Meerut. En route, it will cross Yamuna and Hindon rivers, railway tracks, Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) and pass through dense areas of Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut. The distance between the two ends will be covered in 55 minutes and daily ridership is expected to be more than 8 lakh passengers. While the design speed of the train is 180kmph, the operational speed is 160kmph. Infrastructure will be designed for nine-coach trains which will be available every 5-10 minutes. Train services will not be affected even during extreme weather conditions. Implementation of Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS Corridor is expected to shift the modal share in favour of public transport from 37% to 63% in the region. The train will have coaches for ladies and business class to encourage passengers to leave personal vehicles and use public transport. All three corridors of Phase-1 will converge at Sarai Kale Khan – the other two being Delhi-Gurugram-SNBAlwar and Delhi-Panipat – enabling commuters to travel end-to-end from one corridor to another without having to change the train. Stations will be integrated with airports, railway stations, inter-state bus terminus, and Delhi Metro stations, wherever possible. State government has decided to run intra-city services within Meerut North-South region on RRTS network thereby dropping the proposed North-South Metro corridor. This will result in an estimated saving of Rs 6,300 crore. "

Ghaziabad,Air pollution: NCR towns don’t have information on many sources,"NEW DELHI: IIT Delhi started providing Central Pollution Control Board with pollution projections and possible measures Delhi’s civic bodies could undertake every fortnight from September. These so-called ‘biweekly plans’, however, pertained only to the capital because gaps in emissions inventory data from various sources prevented the extension of the exercise to most other NCR cities. IIT Delhi, has therefore, requested CPCB to set up an emissions inventory cell to provide accurate and updated data related to each source of pollution across NCR. Harsha Kota, assistant professor of civil engineering at IIT Delhi, who specialises in developing air quality models, explained that the plans forecast the levels of pollution in the coming fortnight and the steps to be taken to tackle the problem. However, she told TOI, “If we don’t have the complete data from the emissions inventory, we will be unable to analyse information effectively or forecast the top contributing source for the fortnight.” IIT Delhi currently uses the emissions inventory data of the Union ministry of earth sciences. But to provide CPCB with plans for NCR cities every fortnight, Kota said a dedicated cell was necessary to fill the gaps in existing information. “The biweekly forecasts are in their first year, and the learnings from this can be utilised to make the preventive system more robust,” Kota said. Plans will be made for Sonipat and Faridabad in Haryana and Ghaziabad in UP, but Mukesh Khare, professor at IIT-D, told TOI that the aim was to eventually provide bi-weekly plans for seven cities in Punjab as well. “The biweekly plans state very clearly what steps need to be taken to curb pollution of each type. We need to improve the coordination among the agencies involved. Once we have better data, we can provide accurate forecasts for Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad and other NCR locations,” said Khare. CPCB officials said it would take some time to set up a dedicated data cell. “The bi-weekly plan for Delhi already covers nearby locations in NCR, but we can certainly expand on this,” an official said. CPCB also intends to use its teams on the ground to provide inputs to IIT-D for the biweekly plans. “We are working on how this can be incorporated in the whole exercise,” the official added. In the bi-weekly plan for Delhi for November 1 to 15, IIT-D had identified unpaved roads as a major pollution source in the seven critical pollution areas of Mayapuri, Wazirpur and Okhla in Delhi, Udyog Vihar in Gurugram, Sahibabad in Ghaziabad and two areas in Faridabad.

Lucknow,"Delhi’s tap water is most unsafe, Mumbai’s best: BIS","NEW DELHI: Tap water in Mumbai is the safest for drinking while Delhi’s water is the worst among 21 big cities, according to a report based on sample tests done by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Of greater concern is the fact that all the samples of tap water taken from 15 out of 21 cities failed to meet one or more safety parameters during tests carried out in laboratories. With Chandigarh, Gandhinagar, Patna, Bengaluru, Jammu, Lucknow, Chennai and Dehradun in the list of cities where the tap water quality was found to be below par, the first-of-its-kind report has exposed the failure of water supplying agencies across cities to provide safe drinking water—a basic right for living. The water samples were tested on 28 parameters as prescribed for drinking water standards of BIS notified in 2012. Releasing the report that ranked the cities based on the quality of potable tap water, Union consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said, “We have been working on the task to carry out sample tests to sensitise people and agencies concerned about people’s fundamental right to get clean and safe drinking water. This issue should not be politicised as all of us are concerned about human lives.” According to the test findings, only one of the samples in Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar failed and the two cities were ranked second in the list followed by Ranchi and Raipur. In the case of Delhi, all the 11 samples picked from different parts of the national capital, including Paswan’s home, his office in Krishi Bhawan and several residential areas, failed to meet the norms on a maximum of 19 parameters. The report showed that in most cases samples across cities failed on parameters of total dissolve solids (TDS), turbidity, total hardness, total alkalinity, minerals and metals, and presence of of coliform and E Coli, which can cause severe illness. Citing the alarming test findings, Paswan said there is a need to make the drinking water standard notified by BIS mandatory for all water supplying agencies. He added this becomes all the more important considering it’s not easy to snap water supply and hence efforts have to be made to ensure that the tap water is safe. Sensing that the report may kick off a fresh political battle, the minister said the objective of the study is not to demotivate anyone rather it is to encourage state governments to ensure quality potable tap water is provided to all. He added that samples across states have failed and in the subsequent phases, BIS will come out with test reports of samples lifted from capital cities of north-eastern states and from smart cities. Later, samples will be picked up from the district headquarters and their test results will be made public. The test results of these two batches of samples will be announced in mid-January and by August 15, respectively, consumer affairs ministry officials said. BIS officials said they will soon hold meetings with public health departments, municipal corporations and see how test facilities can be strengthened there, which is key to ensure supply of safe drinking water "
Kanpur,"At 418 AQI, Kanpur continues to struggle with toxic air","LUCKNOW/KANPUR: Industrial city Kanpur emerged as the most polluted and the only city with ‘severe’ air quality in the country on Saturday. According to the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board, Kanpur’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 418. Track the pollution level in your cityThis is for the second time in a week that Kanpur’s air quality has turned severe.  Industrial city Kanpur emerged as the most polluted and the only city with ‘severe’ air quality in the country on Saturday.Pollution level in other cities of Uttar Pradesh dropped by around 60-90 units but still remained in ‘very poor’ category. Five cities of west UP recorded pollution levels above 300. The second most polluted city after Kanpur was Gurugram (360), followed by Ghaziabad (347), Greater Noida (309), Noida (338) and Baghpat (313). As per CBCB’s continuous ambient air quality assessment per hour, PM 2.5 concentration in Nehrunagar locality of Kanpur started rising alarmingly from 349 microgram per cubic metre of air at 6 am to 528 (severe plus) at 9am. It then soared to 660 at 10am which was around 11 times higher than the permissible limit of 60. At 11 am, situation improved a bit when the AQI was recorded at 431. At 1 pm, AQI was 338 and likewise with each hour, the air quality kept improving. Though it did not improve to an extent that it could be said that the air is fit for breathing. At 2 pm, AQI was 274 while at 7 pm, the level settled at 254. Kanpur had attained global infamy last year in May after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it the most polluted city in the list of 4,300 cities around the world where PM2.5 concentration was monitored. Environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta said: “As weather conditions are conducive to higher pollution level, the situation will remain the same till agencies restrict the practice of open garbage burning and reduce vehicular volume on roads. Heavy penalty on garbage burning should be imposed to deter people and odd-even formula may be applied to reduce number of vehicles.” It is expected that the air quality will again worsen during late night hours on Saturday. This was due to the change in the wind direction and also due to dew which does not allow the dust to rise high. The major cause of pollution in the industrial city is the dilapidated and potholed roads. As and when vehicles run on bad roads, it causes dust to surround the atmosphere which cannot rise high. As a result, during the early morning hours, there was thick blanket of smog which also impacted visibility. It appeared there would be no sunshine. People who were out and driving had to switch on their vehicle headlights for better visibility. People also complained of itching in eyes and redness. Further, such an atmosphere is harmful for asthama patients. Many people were witnessed wearing face masks. Others had covered their face using handkerchiefs. Meanwhile, Lucknow continued to struggle with ‘very poor’ air despite drop in air quality index (AQI) indicating air pollution by units from 313 on Friday to 305 on Saturday. No relief is likely soon as weather condition is conducive for accumulation of pollutants. "

Ghaziabad,Wider NH-9 sees 25% of all traffic fines in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: A wider NH-9 is good news for traffic. But the high-speed corridor connecting Delhi and Ghaziabad that is being widened into India’s first 14-lane highway is also seeing traffic violations galore. This inference can be drawn from recent challan data of Ghaziabad traffic police — of over 2.75 lakh vehicles prosecuted by the cops for road rule violations from January to October this year, some 25% were challaned on NH-9 alone, with wrong-side travel, speeding, driving without seatbelt and riding without helmet being the major offences. The latest accident on this highway occurred on Tuesday when nearly two dozen employees of a private company were injured after the private bus in which they were travelling collided with a tractor in Vijay Nagar where the highway is now wider than it has ever been. The other two highways — NH-91 and NH-58 — that pass through the city are equally accident-prone. In fact, the traffic police have identified over 15 black spots on these three highways, including Lal Kuan intersection, Kala Patthar in Indirapuram, Mohan Nagar and Ganga Canal in Muradnagar. According to traffic police data, between January and September this year, as many as 694 accidents happened in Ghaziabad, including on these three highways, in which 298 people died and 474 sustained injuries. In 2018, the number of accidents reported in the city was 672, in which 310 people died and 602 were injured. Two-wheelers topped the list of those challaned for breaking traffic rules. Of the 2,75,962 challans issued between January and October this year, some 1.84 lakh were against bikers, followed by cars (63,358), three-wheelers (18,133), trucks (9,288), buses (611) and tractors (45). Of the bikers, 1.21 lakh were challened for riding without a helmet. Similarly, 24,450 people were fined for driving without seat belts and 6,100 for wrong-side driving, according to this year’s data. Pramhansh Tiwari, traffic inspector, said dangerous driving, stunts by youths and underage driving also figure in the challans. “We have issued 1,036 challans for dangerous driving, 57 for road stunts, and 48 for underage driving. Similarly, 2,428 commuters were fined for using cell phones and 35 for drunk driving during this 10-month period.” “Motorists should understand that by driving on the wrong side or speeding, they are not only putting their lives in danger but also those of others. Traffic police are trying to aware people through nukad natak, posters etc, but change will come when people would understand the value of human life,” Tiwari said. Residents said wrong-side driving has become a menace in Ghaziabad. “I have many a time spotted drivers taking the wrong side on NH-9 to access their residential areas. As at some places on NH-9 near Indirapuram and Khora, high-speed driving on the wrong side often put the lives of local residents at risk due to inadequate streetlights in the night,” said Hemat Tyagi, a Vasundhara resident. SN Singh, SP (traffic), Ghaziabad said the traffic police are issuing challans to violators on a regular basis. “We also celebrate road safety months and try to aware people about traffic rules,” he said. NH-9 is being widened to 14 lanes and the six central lanes are being converted into the access-controlled Delhi-Meerut Expressway, the same way the highway has been developed in Delhi. "

Inspector Chauhan, accused of stealing Rs 70 lakh from thieves during a probe, had hid the money in that factory, police said. Inspector Chauhan, along with constable Dheeraj Bharadwaj, surrendered in an anti-corruption court in Meerut on November 7. The duo was sent to 14-day judicial custody, but the Ghaziabad police took her on a one-day remand for interrogation. Five other cops accused in the case are absconding.

Likewise, a penalty was imposed on the IGL contractor, DS Enterprises, in Sahibabad for carrying out pipe laying work in the area.

Ghaziabad,GMC drags its feet as monkeys run amok in two Ghaziabad colonies,"NOIDA: About a month ago, everyone in Santosh Kaushik’s family started feeling sick and the cause was difficult to pin down. “Turned out, monkeys had damaged the lid of the overhead water tank. The water got contaminated and everyone started getting sick,” said Kaushik, a resident of Shastri Nagar. Between 2016 and now, Ghaziabad’s monkey population has grown from 5,000 to 18,000. The residents don’t know what to do. “My daughter was attacked by a monkey when she was eating on the terrace. She was injured. She doesn’t feel safe in her own home now,” said Somesh Sinha, a resident of Kavi Nagar. The two areas — Shastri Nagar and Kavi Nagar — are the most affected. “You will hardly find a house in these areas that is not fortified with grills to ward off monkeys. But precautions are not enough. Children fall prey to simian attacks all the time,” said Sanjay Mishra, a resident of Shastri Nagar. “Monkeys keep coming in and they uproot every single plant in my garden,” said Shivangi Mishra, a resident of Kavi Nagar. But what rankles is the lack of action by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC). “My children saw monkeys attack a friend. Now, they are afraid of stepping out. I lodged complaints on GMC’s online complaint cell, but there has been no action,” said Rajeev Verma, a resident of Shastri Nagar. A district forest official said the problem so far has been the approach. “Monkeys movein groups of 10-30. It is the alpha male that directs the group and that male has to be controlled,” said a district forest official. For a while, some resident welfare associations tried to fix the problem with langurs — the bigger simian would scare the monkeys away. Protests by animal rights activists stopped that. The GMC, too, ran into problems when it tried to engage professional monkey catchers from Mathura. “Animal rights organisations questioned the way in which monkeys were being caught. So we had to terminate the contract,” said AK Mishra, a GMC official. The forest department said it doesn’t step in unless asked to. The GMC has decided it will reach out to the forest department. “The GMC board has agreed to this. It has also floated tenders to get monkeycatchers,” Mishra added. "
Lucknow,Toxic tap water: BIS sounds alarm bells,"LUCKNOW: Tap water supplied in the city by Jal Sansthan is unfit for consumption. The state capital stands at 11th position among 21 prominent cities in the country, according to a report based on sample tests done by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) — India’s top body which certifies purity and quality of a product. This even as Mumbaikars can directly have water from the tap, the study says. The report was released by Union consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan in Delhi on Saturday. Ten samples each were taken from all the cities to find out if the tap water was fit for human consumption. The first-of-its-kind report has exposed the failure of water supplying agencies across cities to provide safe drinking water—a basic right for living. All the samples collected from various parts of Lucknow failed to meet six parametres, including organoleptic, chemical composition, adulteration, toxicity and bacteriological substances. The ranking was based on samples found fit and the parametres they qualify. For instance, Mumbai was number one as all samples cleared tests for 21 parametres. All the Chandigarh samples also failed, but the Union territory still got the seventh position. While Chandigarh could not qualify only two parametres, Lucknow failed in six. Lucknow was below Ranchi (third), Raipur (fourth) and Patna and Bhopal (both sharing the ninth position). Jammu shared the 11th position with Lucknow. Regular reality checks by TOI have been highlighting the poor quality of water supplied in the city. Besides odour and bitter taste, people in many areas complain about supply mixed with sand, algae and even sewage. Most people have installed water purifiers at home. Even several tests done by the joint team of the health department and Jal Sansthan during monsoon also found water unfit for drinking at many places, posing a threat of diseases such as hepatitis, diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid and cholera. General manager of Jal Santhan S K Verma said, “Once we get the report, we will conduct tests again and take measures to rectify the problem.” "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Release funds for piped water, CM requests Centre","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath requested the Union Jal Shakti ministry to release funds for the piped drinking water supply project for Bundelkhand as he wanted to lay the foundation for the project by December. During a meeting with Jal Shakti ministry secretary Parameswaran Iyer on Saturday, the CM directed his team to finish work on the project within a month so that was ready for launch by year-end. ""The chief minister and the secretary discussed ways to conserve water in the state and how the piped water scheme could be implemented in all parts of the state under the Jal Jivan Mission and the Swachh Bharat Mission. Iyer assured the CM that the points raised by him would be incorporated in the ministry's plans and a water supply scheme will be devised keeping in mind an allocation of 55 litre /person per day,"" said a senior government official. The CM said that families with defunct toilets or those who were not included in the base line survey should not be added to the list and should be provided resources to get toilets built under the Swachh Bharat Mission. A scheme for extending piped water supply scheme to all houses is to be prepared, with special emphasis on Bundelkhand and Vindhyanchal region. He also directed the state Jal Shakti department to focus on revival and rejuvenation of old hand pumps, tubewells and wells to boost groundwater reserves and encourage rainwater harvesting. "
Kanpur,Transferred cop's 65-km protest run to Bitholi ends in suspension,"KANPUR: A sub-inspector posted in Etawah, who embarked on a 65-km run to protest his transfer to Bitholi police station, was suspended for indiscipline on Saturday. The cop, who collapsed and fainted after covering 40km on Friday, was admitted to a community health centre where his condition is said to be stable. The incident came to light after the video of sub-inspector Vijay Pratap running in the middle of the road in Etawah went viral on Friday. He had also posted a tweet on Thursday evening. ""I am being transferred due to the dictatorial attitude of RI (reserve inspector of police). I was asked by the SSP to stay back at reserve police lines but I am being forcibly transferred to Bitholi by the RI. You can call it my anger or unhappiness but I'll run &amp; go to Bitholi,"" Pratap tweeted. SP (city), Etawah, Ram Yash Singh said: ""The sub-inspector was transferred from reserve police lines to Bitholi. Instead of accepting the transfer order like any disciplined officer, he posted a message on social media on Thursday evening."" ""A probe has been ordered. If he is found guilty, disciplinary action will follow,"" he added. He said several complaints had been received against the sub-inspector in the past. ""Many people, including Sadar MLA have accused him of misbehaviour with local representatives as well as residents. The S-I, who seems to be influenced by a particular ideology, has even been warned by his seniors,"" he said. The SP said the errant cop had even posted derogatory remarks against the Prime Minister and UP chief minister on social media, for which he had been warned. "
Ghaziabad,Delhi-NCR air pollution: Task force suggests lifting ban on dirty-fuel factories,"NEW DELHI: As air quality improved on Saturday, the CPCB-led Graded Response Action Plan task force recommended lifting the ban on industries operating on coal in Delhi-NCR. “Industrial operations such as coal-based industries in Faridabad, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Sonepat and Bahadurgarh, and non-PNG industries in Delhi, which were earlier banned by EPCA, may commence subject to taking adequate control measures and compliance to prescribed environmental norms,” the task force stated. Supreme Court had on November 4 banned construction and demolition activities in the region till further orders. “Hot mix plant, ready mix plants and stone crusher shall continue to remain closed,” the task force stated on Saturday. As part of pre-emptive steps during the polluted Diwali period, SC-appointed EPCA on suggestions of the task force ordered ban on construction from 6pm to 6am from October 26-30. On October 31, the ban was extended four more hours from 6pm to 10am. On November 1, complete ban was announced before the apex court blanket ban. During the meeting on Saturday, officials noted how improvement in AQI was observed, which reached ‘very poor’ from ‘severe’ and ‘severe plus’ categories it was hovering around in the past few days. The state pollution control boards and other implementing agencies have, however, been asked to continue to remain on alert, ensure regular surveillance and take all necessary actions to curb air polluting activities. Earlier, on November 6, the Supreme Court gave Delhi government seven days to fix the 13 spots identified as the most polluted in the city. "

Asha came to Lucknow initially to judge the Miss Diva Lucknow auditions a few years ago. On her second visit to Lucknow, the beauty queen said, “Lucknow is a beautiful city full of lovely people and delicious food. Since I’m a vegetarian, all my friends asked me to try the basket chaat when I told them that I was going to Lucknow. I had chhole kulche for lunch and even managed to go in and around the Bada Imambara as we were shooting there. I must say the Imambara is beautiful.” Telling us about jer journey into the world of glamour, Asha said that she won the Miss India Supranational pageant in 2014 and then went on to win the internatioonal pageant too and became the first Indian to win the said pageant, “It has been a very humbling experience. Whatever and whoever I am today as an actor, the due credit goes to the Miss India organisation for giving me my first platform, which was the pageant. After winning the pageant I moved to Mumbai in 2016 wherein my journey as an actor started with me giving auditions for films,TVCs, etc. In the year 2017, I bagged my first role in the film 'Junglee' opposite Vidyut Jammwal. Now, because of 'Junglee', I got my second film after people saw my work. So one thing led to another, from pageants to films. So I’d say my journey has been fabulous and very gratifying,” said the talented diva. When asked about her journey and the whole experience of winning the pageant, Asha said, “My life changed for good. It was very different earlier. I was studying engineering in Bangalore when my parents were like ‘See, the Miss India auditions are happening, why don’t you try for it?’ So for my parents, it was like Oh meri beti thodi lambi hai, acchi dikhtihai, she should definitely try this out.” Asha went on to add, “In my head, I was like what is happening? Yeh kaisa transition hai from boots to heels, I’ve never even worn heels, never walked a ramp, never been a model! My mother, however, would say that ‘Doesn’t matter what kind of a job it is, even if you’re sweeping the floor, make sure no one sweeps it better than you. Be the best in whatever you do.’ So I took it up as a challenge and I gave my best. I learnt from each and every person that I could, even did a lot of research and learning online after moving to Mumbai. It was quite a challenge when you know no one from this industry and are unfamiliar with the city, but I’m here now nonetheless.” Speaking further about winning the beauty pageant, Asha added, “I’m a practical kind of a person, however, so even before going for the pageant I thought to myself that if there are 83 countries participating, one out of 83, what’s the probability of winning? With probabilities like these, you don’t expect a lot. All you do is give your best and so I did.

At that time, I didn’t know who's directing the film ya actor kaun hai or anything else, all I knew was the character i was supposed to play. So I auditioned for both the characters,Shankara and Meera. I gave a couple of round of auditions.

That’s when I realised that Chuck Russell is the director, a Hollywood director and I’m playing Meera opposite Vidyut Jammwal in the film! It was overwhelming. I was very very happy. I could see a sense of pride on my loved one's faces. Seeing that I realised that I’ve achieved something significant.” Talking about the idea of venturing into films, the model turned actress said, “I just went with the flow. Khayal mein bhi aaya nahi tha kabhi. The thing is, ever since childhood I was into Bharatanatyam, Karnatakashastriya Sangeeta, veena, painting, studying, sports, everything. So it was a typical south Indian family where studies and cultural things go hand-in-hand. That somehow helped me hone my skills. It was not like I did acting but all this helped me with my expressions and all during auditions. My learning ground I feel has been the Miss Diva auditions. I used to just set out of the house to give auditions right from morning.

Lucknow,Have 3 litigants' nod to file review plea: AIMPLB,"LUCKNOW: Eight days after the Supreme Court's unanimous Ayodhya verdict, at least three Muslim litigants under the aegis of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Sunday decided to file a petition in the Supreme Court, seeking a review of the judgment. At a meeting here, AIMPLB also decided not to accept the 5-acre ‘alternative’ land for construction of a mosque. The board said it was seeking a review since the Muslim side had approached the SC for ownership of Babri Masjid land and not for an alternative site. However, the main party from the Muslim side, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, which had said on the day of the verdict that it would not file a review petition, reiterated on Sunday that there was no change in its position. Board chairman Zufar Faruqi, who skipped the AIMPLB meeting despite being invited, told TOI, “We stick to our old stand about accepting the SC verdict. Filing a review petition would mean doing a volte-face. If any other litigant wants to appeal, they can. About allotment of five-acre land, we will decide at the board’s meeting on November 26.” Iqbal Ansari, son of the oldest litigant from the Muslim side, has also opposed a review plea. After a day-long meeting, AIMPLB (which is not a party to the case) claimed that it had received affirmation from three Muslim litigants, Mohammad Umar, Maulana Mahfuzur Rahman and Misbahuddin, to move the review plea with its legal backing within 30 days of the SC verdict. Umar, son of one of the first Muslim litigants in the Ayodhya title suit, told TOI, “I am ready to file a petition seeking review of SC’s verdict on Ayodhya.” Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JuH) also announced that it would independently file a review petition after it termed the verdict ""not based on evidence or logic"". JuH, which was a party in the title suit, had opposed the 5-acre offer on Thursday. AIMPLB claimed the verdict was replete with contradictions, ""beyond comprehension at certain"" junctions and ""prima facie unfair"". The meeting was presided over by AIMPLB chief Maulana Rabey Hasani Nadwi and attended by 45 of its 51 working committee members, including JuH representatives Arshad Madani and Mehmood Madani, Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and AIMPLB general secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani. “The Ayodhya suit was a representative suit from all Muslims and AIMPLB was chosen as the umbrella Muslim body to take care of legalese. The board will file a review and declines the offer of 5 acres to be allotted by the government,” Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) convener and AIMPLB secretary Zafaryab Jilani told reporters. “It’s not contempt of court if Muslims do not want land from the government,” he said. “Waqf Act 1995 and Islamic Shariah have no provision for exchange or transfer of mosque land. And we believe the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board will respect the view of Muslims in declining the 5-acre land within the Act’s ambit,” Jilani said. On Sunday, the meeting venue was changed from Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama to Mumtaz PG College at the eleventh hour after AIMPLB officials claimed that they were asked by the district administration not to hold the meet at Nadwa.

JuH president Maulana Arshad Madani said the 'Babri verdict was not based on evidence and logic' and this made it necessary for filing a review plea.

But talking about coming here, I have been to Lucknow a couple of times before too. When Sonu didi used to perform here, I have come with her. The thing that I remember about Lucknow is the tehzeeb.

But for some time, the trend of non-filmi Hindi singles and albums faded away. But believe me, it is really difficult today to get a Hindi single hit because our competition is directly with Bollywood music. Punjabi mein ek edge hoti hai as Punjab is a country-like state. The support there is too much. I am really happy that woh agar hit ho rahe hain aaj ke time pe mere toh I am blessed. I am really happy to see today that the number of singles all over the country has increased manifold. Aaj ke time pe toh bahut zyada non-filmi music ho raha hai hamari industry mein. The top 10 songs list in the country today has majority of non-filmi songs. Tony Kakkar (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Tony Kakkar (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) What is your personal favourite genre of music?I like soft romantic tracks and ghazals a lot. But unfortunately there is hardly any demand for ghazals these days, which is really sad! I did compose a ghazalish kind of a song Zindagi Mil Jayegi with Neha (Kakkar) but I gave it a different twist to it so that it can be liked by the youth of today. Your sister Neha mentioned the struggles all three of you had before making it big in the music industry. How has the journey been so far?When my sisters Sonu didi and Neha used to go for jagratas in Delhi, I too would accompany them as a backing vocalist. I also used to compose Mata ki bhetein for them. Even though all three of us are quite well settled now, that was the best phase of our lives as we used to perform together. As unbelievable as it might sound, but we would be booked for bhajan sandhyas and mata ke jagrate for the whole month. It was only during monsoons that we used get a break. We did that for almost 12 years. So as siblings all three of us came together a lot. Hamare koi dost hi nahi hote thay and we used to be each other’s friends as well. So did anyone of you help each other in making a career in the music industry?No, all three of us had our own share of struggles and couldn’t help each other. Sonu didi got her first break when she participated in a reality show and music directer Sandeep Chowta loved her voice and promised her a break in his next venture. Neha was busy with her own set of struggles. She participated in Indian Idol and then couldn't make it but then met Pritam da who gave her Second Hand Jawani. I met Pooja Bhatt ma’am, who made me meet Bhushan Kumar sir, who gave me Saawan Aaya Hai song. So hum teenon hi struggle karte rahe apni apni and couldn't help each other. How did you help your sister cum friend fight depression after she broke off with her boyfriend Himansh Kohli?We siblings are really well connected and bonded even though we might not meet daily now. Time healed Neha automatically. yes she used to feel weak emotionally a lot. In fact, Neha is the most emotional of us three. I advised her to not react and say things openly. I explained to her to not show the sad side of her to her fans and we should make our fans feel happy all the time. Neha has a lot of young fans who get depressed seeing her sad. Aur waise bhi Neha ki toh smile bahot achhi hai. What about the memes made on Neha’s habit of crying at the drop of a hat?Neha ke rote hue memes toh maine bhi bahot dekhe hain. The whole family laughs at the memes made on Neha. We actually take them in a lighter way. You have also been advocating for equal royalties for singers and writers. How successful has it been so far?Main thodi apni pakad bana loon then definitely I will work towards it. I need the support of the singers. I was hearing about Santosh Anand ji who has written the song Ek Pyaar Ka Nagma Hai, he now needs financial help today though his song is a nation wide hit even today. The song has earned a lot of money but none of that went to the song writer, which is really sad to know. I want to make a route for that money to reach all levels and that can happen only once I know the real business secrets of this music industry. "

Lucknow,"With 22,300 road accident deaths, Uttar Pradesh tops India list","LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh with 22,256 causalities topped the chart of road accident deaths in the country in 2018. On an average, 60 road crash deaths were recorded in the state every day, according to the latest Road Accident Report. The state was at the top of the same list in 2017 too. Though Tamil Nadu (Rank 1) and Madhya Pradesh (Rank 2) recorded more road accidents in comparison to UP (Rank 3), the number of fatalities in these two states was lesser than Uttar Pradesh. In 2018, a total 63,920, accidents were reported in Tamil Nadu, which was 50% more than UP but the number of deaths was 39% lesser than UP. Likewise, Madhya Pradesh, recorded 51,397 accidents in 2018 which killed 10,706 persons. When compared to UP, the number of accidents was 20% higher but that of death was 51% lesser than UP. In Tamil Nadu, the rate of accidents came down by 2.5% and in MP by 3.7%. But UP recorded an increase of 9.8% in the same period. Experts attribute the higher number of road crash fatalities in UP to poor referral system. Dr Ajai Singh of KGMU’s orthopaedics and surgery department said there is no dedicated medical arrangement in place to attend to road accident victims. “Road accident victims must be provided medical aid during the golden hour, but our state lacks proper network of ambulances, police also react late while primary health centres are ill-equipped to tackle such cases,” he said. Ashutosh Soti, founder of Shubham Soti Foundation, a Lucknow-based NGO working for road safety, said that awareness about road accidents and primary treatment to victims should be made part of school curriculum. “The state has started taking initiatives like adding ambulance in UP 112 emergency helpline and conducting road safety audits but more has to be done like regular awareness drives to curb road crashes and deaths,” he added.

Having a beauty queen serve them pulao and kheer was the most cherished moment for the students, most of whom come from humble backgrounds. But even after serving all of them, when they didn’t start to eat, Vartika was slightly perplexed. She asked them the reason for not eating the food, to which one of the girls quipped, ""Ma’am haath nahi wash kiya hai!"" The answer had Vartika pleasantly surprised who promptly led the students outside to wash their hands and then sat down with them to eat the pulao. Emphasising on the need to include fruits in their daily diet, Vartika, later, distributed bananas to the kids. While giving out bananas, the diva spoke about the health benefits of the fruit.

Lucknow,Dengue? Same symptoms trigger confusion over fever in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: For five days, the Alam family in Balaganj was in a state of terror when Mohammad Hayat (8) was down with high fever and severe muscular pain. As drugs provided little relief and blood test reports took time, news of dengue deaths in city escalated their fear. “After five frightening days, we heaved a sigh of relief when it was confirmed that my child was suffering from high-grade viral fever and not dengue or malaria,” said Hayat’s father Mohammad Parvez Alam. “I took leave from office, browsed internet, and consulted several doctors,” he said.  Like the Alams, several families were distressed for days while waiting for dengue report. Doctors said cases of high-grade fever with temperature soaring to 103-104 degree Fahrenheit have increased. Fever is a common symptom of viral flu, dengue, malaria, typhoid and chikungunya. Blood test generally takes at least three days to confirm virus. During this period, people try all sorts of remedies at home but experts say self-treatment could be fatal. “All these diseases —viral, vector-borne or any other bacterial infection—if monitored and managed properly, are curable,” said associate prof D Himanshu, medicine department of KGMU.

Lucknow,UPPCL trusts to plead as ‘unsecured creditors’ in Bombay high court,"LUCKNOW: The UP State Power Sector Employees’ Trust and UPPCL CPF Trust, which invested employees’ money in the tainted firm DHFL, will claim to be ‘unsecured creditors’ who need to be treated differently when the case comes up for hearing in the Bombay high court on Wednesday. An unsecured creditor is an individual or institution that lends money without obtaining specified assets as collateral, and is thus exposed to higher risk as it does not have anything to fall back on. On Tuesday, UPPCL chairman Arvind Kumar, who is also ex-officio chairman of both trusts, dashed off to Mumbai to meet attorneys of the law firm J Sagar Associates hired for the case. When contacted, Kumar told TOI, “We are keeping our fingers crossed. It is hard earned money of employees which needs to be brought back. We are trying our best.” UPPCL sources said the trusts will inform the Bombay high court about the feeling of insecurity and resentment brewing in employees who are on strike over their PF funds being trapped in DHFL and will request it to lift the freeze on remittances.

The trusts moved the Bombay high court on Monday as an intervener in the original suit involving Reliance Nippon Life Assets Management Company versus DHFL wherein remittances by the latter were frozen by court. UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma told TOI, “The state government is playing proactive role in ensuring that the interests of employees are not hit.” Convener of UP Rajya Vidyut Karmchari Sangharsh Samiti, Shailendra Dubey, said, “Employees will wait for the high court to deliver its judgement and will then decide future course of action.” The employees have gone on a 48-hour work boycott demanding state government to take guarantee of Rs 2,268 crore trapped in DHFL and seeking a white paper on the investments.

Lucknow,When Lucknow University saw light after three dark decades,"In the countdown to LU centenary, TOI through various articles recalled the glorious history of the institution. Beginning today we will focus on the challenges faced by the varsity since 1970s and its struggle for revival 2000 onward. LUCKNOW: Lucknow University which came into existence in 1921 had a golden run till 1960s. It boasted of internationally acclaimed faculty and students from across India who went on to make illustrious careers in their respective fields. But the advent of 70s set in the downturn, recall LU old timers. It started with nepotism, casteism and political interference in the appointment of vice-chancellors and teachers, followed by the derailment of the academic session in 70s. Teaching standards began to drop in 80s while 90s saw the criminalisation of students politics and university’s struggle to procure funds for development works. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.However, the university’s slow revival began in 2000 with regularisation of the academic session and crackdown on students with criminal record. Some departments again rose to prominence. In the present time, fund crunch and academic excellence remain the biggest challenges for the institution in its centenary year. ACADEMICS Most of the LU’s illustrious faculty retired by 1959 and gradually political influence began in the appointment of VCs and teachers, said former LU vice-chancellor Prof Roop Rekha Verma, adding that this had an adverse impact on the varsity’s fortunes. “The academic standard was high till 1967 when I was a student. But gradually favouritism took over merit, and by 80s, caste became a major factor in appointments,” said Prof Dinesh Kumar, former botany HOD who served on various administrative posts in LU. “PAC revolt in 1973, which was supported by a section of students, dealt a severe blow. It led to arson and closure of LU for three months. Thereafter, academic session remained derailed for 25 years, during which meritorious students from across the country stopped opting for LU,” he added. Old timers recall that while the student numbers doubled between 1970-2000 due to the introduction of more courses and evening classes, LU did not see the corresponding increase in the number of teachers. As a result, teacher-student ratio came down from 1:30 in 1970 to 1:90 by 2000. STUDENTS’ UNION Student outfits backed by political parties made debut on LU campus only after Independence. They galvanised students on ideological lines and even produced political stalwarts. But blatant interference of parties in students’ union elections began in 90s when politicians started visiting the campus and openly endorsed candidates. “As students’ union election became launch pads for political careers they became a do or die battle for candidates. Gradually, criminal elements entered the unions, leading to lawlessness on the campus,” said former head of political science department, Prof SK Dwivedi. Lucknow University Alumni Association president and former proctor Prof MP Singh said, “Students’ union became a platform for grabbing government contracts and launching political careers rather than making students aware of various ideologies. Hostels became hideouts of criminals. Every union election witnessed violent clashes and shootouts on the campus. Several murders also took place.” LU alumni recalled how PAC was stationed permanently on the campus and a police outpost was set up due to frequent law and order problem. In 1997, seven student leaders with criminal cases were expelled. They included Abhay Singh and Dhananjay Singh, both of whom are now politicians in UP. Police raids in hostels during that period saw recovery of illegal fire arms and crude bombs. “Between 2004 and 2007, when students’ union system was in place, over a dozen students were killed and hundreds injured in clashes related to union politics. Student leaders extorted money from traders, attacked teachers, abetted mass-copying in examinations and forcibly ensured bogus admissions,” said a retired LU professor FINANCE LU couldn’t keep pace with technology and infrastructure required for quality teaching because of financial constraints post 90s. First blow came in 1995 when the state government said grants would be given equivalent to funds raised by LU through its resources like fees. In 1998, the state government froze the grant of Rs 16 crore and directed state universities to become self-sufficient. “LU introduced several self-finance courses to generate money. But since additional teachers were not recruited, it impacted teaching standard,” said Prof Dinesh Kumar Prof Yashveer Tyagi, former dean of commerce faculty, said, “Cash crunch consumed most of our energy in arranging funds at that time. It reflected in decline in infrastructure and research on the campus.” REVIVAL In 2001, academic session was regularised by then VC Prof DP Singh. In 2006, then VC Prof RP Singh purged hostels and ousted over 100 students with criminal record. Since then LU has had a peaceful atmosphere and some of its departments have shot into prominence again. "

Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh: Census 2021 from May, staff to use mobile app","LUCKNOW: The UP government on Tuesday issued notification for the commencement of Census 2021 in the state from May 2020. It would be the first time when the census enumerators will use an app on their smartphones to collect and upload data as they visit households during the 45-day exercise, instead of feeding data manually in registers. The secretary of general administration, Hari Om, who issued the notification on behalf of the state government, told TOI that the enumerators would be armed with an app on their smart phones for recording data instead of the traditional way of entering it in bulky registers. “The enumerators will use a mobile app for headcount and facilities in households. The digital system being introduced for the first time in this census would be a huge benefit and will reduce chances of flaws as compared to the old system and will also save time in uploading the census data,” said Hari Om. The secretary informed that the next census data would be released in 2021 for which a 45-day massive exercise would begin from May 16, 2020. Before issuing the notification, the Directorate of Census Operations, UP, started a week-long training of master trainers, who would train the census supervisors in the coming days. The training camp was inaugurated by Director of Census Operations, UP, Narendra Shankar Pandey while director-general, Rural Development Training Institute, Venkateshwar Loo, was the chief guest while Hari Om was special guest. The training programmes for the census operation have started and would be subsequently held at district-level to prepare enumerators who would be engaged in the exercise, he said. For the first time, census enumerators will seek information from households on smartphones, DTH/Cable TV connection, internet access, number of members of households having bank accounts, ownership of house other than rented accommodation of a household, bottled water availability and mobile number, Hari Om said.

Kanpur,"Mayor, team catches 40 cattle from Kanpur dairies, realizes Rs 30,000 fine","KANPUR: Following a campaign launched against private dairies operating in the city, a team, led by mayor Pramila Pandey on Wednesday, caught around 40 cattle at Natwan Tola in Juhi area of the city and sent them to a 'gaushala' in Jajmau. The mayor also realized a fine of Rs 30,000 from the dairy owners. The mayor and her team first reached Juhi Natwal Tola along with cattle catching squad and asked the dairy owners to remove their dairies outside the city limits by vehicles to be provided by Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC). When the dairy owners opposed the move and accosted the mayor, the police resorted to lathi-charge and dispersed the protestors. During an inspection of another dairy, she found just three animals there. She asked the dairy owner to open the attached room but he refused to provide the keys of the lock. Then the police, on instructions of the mayor, broke open the lock and found that a large number of animals were tied there. The mayor thereafter imposed a fine of Rs 30,000 and realized it from the dairy owners. On Tuesday also, the mayor raided dairies at the 80 Feet road and Ashok Nagar. At one dairy, there were around 50 cattle but the cattle catching squad could catch only three cows and three buffaloes because the squad expressed its helplessness to transport all the cattle to some other place.

A delegation of Rajputs from the foundation had earlier met former UP governor Ram Naik in March 2019. In April, the governor had sent a letter to CM Yogi Adityanath, putting in a word about the delegation’s request. “The deputy CM was in Sultanpur, so we extended our request of renaming the city to him,” said senior lawyer and member of the foundation Arvind Singh ‘Raja’. “Two district gazetteers of Sultanpur, one from 1903 under the British government and the other from 1982 under the UP government, refer to Sultanpur as Kushbhawanpur, Kushpur and Kushvati,” he added.

The foundation’s letter to Maurya on Wednesday also made a reference to poet Kalidas’s ‘Raghuvnash Mahakavya’ and city-based writer Rajeshwar Singh’s book ‘Sultanpur: Itihas ki Jhalak’. The Hindi book mentions that Ram had two sons: Luv and Kush.

Sources in UPPCL said the court heard the case of the two trust for three hours before deciding to defer it till next week. The decision to go on an indefinite strike was taken in a meeting of employees held under the aegis of UP Vidyut Karamchari Sangharsh Samiti. The employees have been demanding that the state government releases a white paper on the amount invested in DHFL between March 2017 and December 2018.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Ignored for days, youth stands on garbage pile, forces LMC to act","LUCKNOW: One man alone can make a difference, even if nobody comes forward to support him. This was proven by a 25-year-old activist in the city on Wednesday. After several complaints about a garbage dump in his locality Daliganj fell on deaf ears and authorities and other residents refused to support him, Rahman Saifi decided to take a stand. Standing firm, literally, Saifi stood on a pile of garbage with posters explaining his protest for one full day. The video of his unique protest went viral on social media, forcing Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) to act. They cleared the rotting garbage dump lying on the roadside for three days, within 20 minutes. According to Saifi, for three days, the dump was not only attracting scores of stray animals, making the area accident-prone, but also leading to dangers to health. Two children in the area had fallen sick—one was down with viral fever and another with diarrhoea. Adding to the menace was the foul smell emanating constantly.

He then asked his neighbours and family members to hold a demonstration to draw attention of authorities but all of them excused themselves. While some said they were busy, others claimed it was no use doing so as LMC reacts only VIPs are involved. However, this did not stop Saifi, who decided to stage a protest alone. “I printed posters with messages and decided to stand on the garbage pile so that people would notice,” he told TOI. In the morning, he pasted several posters on the wall and held one in his hand which read, “this garbage can take our lives” and “will do or die but not leave”. His act encouraged some of his friends who came forward in support. One of them started a live video on Facebook. Soon, the video went viral and within 20 minutes, LMC officers led by zonal officer JP Yadav were on the spot, persuading Saifi to leave. LMC got the area cleaned and gave in writing that from now, trash bins will be put up at the spot and open dumping won’t be allowed. Residents who had earlier refused to stand with Saifi were all praise after his protest worked. “Thanks to Saifi’s initiative, the area is clean now. We did not take part in the protest because LMC workers are thick-skinned and our earlier protests made no impact. In fact, on Bakrid, somebody threw animal carcass here which kept rotting for days and our complaints went unheard,” said Anshul Gupta, a resident. The zonal officer said, “We will find out who was responsible for collecting garbage from the area and take action.” "

Imran, who is former chairperson of UP Bar Council, said: “If All India Muslim Personal Law Board is going for a review in SC, the Sunni Waqf Board should also take into account the sentiments of the Muslim community, even if there may not be much hope.” Will land be used to construct a mosque or for charity: MuslimsTOI could not contact the remaining two Board members - Tazeen Fatima (Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan’s wife) and Maulana Syed Ahmed Ali alias Khushnood Miyan – for their views on the review petition. Both of them are from Rampur. The two dissenting members in the Board, Abdul and Imran, also said that the offer of five-acre land for a mosque should not be accepted. Abrar also agreed with the duo on the five-acre and offer, though he toed the Board chief ’s line that a review petition should not be filed. “A lot of Muslims have approached us on whether to accept the alternative land. Another issue is, if it is accepted, what use would it be put to -- to build a mosque or for charitable purpose? We will bring all these suggestions to the table on November 26,"" said Adnan. Questioning the rationale for the five-acre land offer, Imran said: “SC accepted that the mosque was built in 1528. So, its existence was proven. That it was desecrated in 1949 was also accepted and so was its demolition in 1992. On what basis then is the compensation being given to Muslims?"" Supporting Imran, Abdul said: “Alternative land should not be accepted for ‘Allah ka ghar’ (house of God). A review of the order should also be done.” Both Imran and Abdul claimed they had maintained a distance from Board’s meetings for the last few years. However, they, would voice their opinion on the twin issues in the November 26 meeting, they said. Board chief Faruqi, on his part, has said that the fate of the five-acre alternative land will be decided in the November 26 meeting and nothing could be said on this issue before that. The Board, which has received a number of suggestions on the use of the alternative land, will deliberate on these, including ideas like establishing a hospital or an educational institution. "

Lucknow,"Mercury dips below 13°C, Met says winter is coming","LUCKNOW: Shruti Pant had to put on a jacket while riding her scooter home after tuition on Tuesday evening; she pulled over a bed sheet at night; and found the warmth of a cuppa endearing on a misty Wednesday morning. The 19-year-old student exemplified collective behaviour of Lucknow’s residents as the city’s minimum temperature dropped below 13 degrees Celsius in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, the lowest reading post-monsoon. Weathermen say the nippy night and morning are clear indication that winter is knocking on the door and is expected to set in by the first week of December.

Lucknow,VHP: Don’t want ‘sarkaari’ Ram temple,"LUCKNOW: Vishwa Hindu Parishad national general secretary Milind Parande has said the government should refrain from making the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya a ‘sarkaari’ (government owned) one and should instead place in a mechanism to facilitate its construction at the earliest. Speaking exclusively to TOI on Thursday, Parande said temple’s construction should instead be made out of people’s contribution since it is associated with the faith of Hindus. “We believe that the society should contribute and the temple should be built out of those contributions. The government should not spend its money,” he told Parande. On November 12, TOI had reported that VHP was working on a plan to raise money for the temple through crowdfunding. Parande’s observation comes over 10 days after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of a Ram temple at the disputed Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site and asked the state government to form a trust for construction of a temple.

Kanpur,Governor Anandiben Patel invokes Germany to back epic womb ‘sanskar’,"LUCKNOW: Citing Abhimanyu’s learning in the womb in the epic Mahabharata, Governor Anandiben Patel on Thursday said all universities should have a ‘garbha sanskar’ corner where girl students can be taught dos and don’ts during pregnancy and (moolbhoot sanskar) primary values for family life (grahasth jeevan). This would help improve mother-child health and curb malnutrition, she said. The governor, said, while an institute in Germany adopted the Mahabharataa concept of learning in the womb, no formal education is even imparted to girls on procedures to be adopted during pregnancy. According to Mahabharata, the governor said, Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, learnt war skills in his mother’s (Subhadra) womb. He is said to have heard Arjuna narrating to Subhadra how to break the ‘chakravyuh’, a seven-layer military formation by enemy. Abhimanyu learnt how to smash six layers, but did not hear the last one as Subhadra fell asleep, she said, while addressing students and teachers at fourth annual convocation of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Urdu, Arabi-Farsi University in Lucknow. Anandiben Patel, who is also chancellor of universities in UP, sought setting up of camps for health check-up of girl students. “A report should be submitted to my office on adoption of villages where students can volunteer to educate others,” she said. “Every university should have a books corner which caters to healthcare during pregnancy, after delivery and general health issues of women,” she said.

Lucknow,Garbage on roads mocks LMC’s clean pledge in high court,"LUCKNOW: Unattended garbage in Daliganj, which prompted a youth to get his feet literally dirty in protest on Wednesday, is only the tip of an iceberg. A TOI reality check on Thursday exposed mounds of trash across city neighbourhoods, most of them rotting and throwing up an olfactory challenge for residents of New Hyderabad, Alambagh, Jankipuram, Chowk, Campbell Road and Gomtinagar, among others. While the widely circulated picture of the Daliganj youth standing in a heap of garbage for hours prompted the authorities to mount an immediate cleaning drive, complaints of citizens elsewhere have failed to jolt the LMC out of slumber. This despite the civic body assuring the high court and Uttar Pradesh Solid Waste Management Monitoring Committee in May that it would come up with a mechanism to free roads of rubbish within a month.

Lucknow,"Student-teacher ratio skewed, Lucknow University cries for faculty fillip","LUCKNOW: Once upon a time, the University of Lucknow boasted professors with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge. Cut to the present: it is grappling with acute faculty crunch. Both LU and its 170 affiliated colleges fail to meet the teacher-student ratio set by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The sanctioned faculty strength at the varsity alone is 516 while the number of students on the rolls is 25,000. In other words, the preferred teacher-student ratio is 1:50. Currently, the varsity is short of 172 professors and posts lying vacant for around three years. With only 344 permanent appointments in place, the teacher-student ratio is 1:70. A maximum of 75 posts are vacant for assistant professors while there are 37 and 60 vacancies, respectively, for professors and associate professors. NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.“We had filled up some vacant posts in 2018. Thereafter, there was a freeze on appointments by UGC, owing to change in rules. Hence, all posts couldn’t be filled up. We will plug vacancies soon,” said former vice-chancellor SP Singh. The situation is no different in degree colleges, where an entire department is being run by a single professor or a course has been discontinued because there is no one to teach. Several departments also face closure with the retirement of 20% teachers. For 20,000-odd students in 19 government-aided colleges, the sanctioned teaching posts are 817. Of these, 197 are lying vacant. According to UGC, the student-teacher ratio should be 1:40 in affiliated colleges. It is expected to cross 1:60 from the next session in many colleges. At Shri Jai Narain PG College, for instance, 50 posts are lying vacant. Departments like geology and anthropology have no permanent faculty members. For 10,500 students, there are 139 sanctioned posts, but only 89 have been filled. The student-teacher ratio has touched an alarming 1:90. “Around 50% of our departments are dependent on guest faculty. In geology, there are three sanctioned posts, but two are vacant. The only faculty member is on leave,” said principal SD Sharma. For 4,000 students at Bappa Sri Narayan Vocational Degree College, the sanctioned teaching posts are 77. Of these, 31 are lying vacant. “If the posts are not quickly filled up, many departments will face the threat of closure,” said principal Rakesh Chandra. Here too, the approximate student-teacher ratio is 1:90. “Departments like ancient Indian history and Arab culture, which were running with a single faculty member, have no teacher now with those serving having retired,” Chandra added. At Navyug Kanya Mahavidyalaya, there is only one teacher each in the departments of botany, education and philosophy for the past four years. In all, 19 posts are vacant and there are 3,500 students. The ratio is 1:70. “The college, with its own resources, has appointed guest faculty so that courses are not discontinued. The UP Higher Education Service Commission should fill up vacant posts soon,” said principal Shrishti Srivastava. Posts at LU-affiliated colleges are lying vacant because recruitment has not been conducted by the higher education commission in the past few years. “Quality of education at a 100-year-old university cannot improve unless appointments are done,” summed up Manoj Pandey, the president of Lucknow University Teachers’ Association.

Lucknow,‘What’s language got to do with religion? Premchand learnt Urdu from a Maulvi’,"LUCKNOW: As unrest sweeps Banaras Hindu University (BHU) over a Muslim professor, Firoz Khan teaching Sanskrit, grandson of one of India’s great Hindi-Urdu writer Munshi Premchand tweeted how his ‘Kayastha Hindu’ grandfather had learnt Urdu from a ‘Maulvi Saheb’ in his early life. He asks what has language got to do with religion? Munshi Premchand was born in Lamhi, a small village about six kilometres from Varanasi in 1880 as Dhanpat Rai. The tweet by Premchand’s grandson, Pravir Rai (45), went viral on Thursday after which speaking to TOI he recalled all the Muslim influences on Premchand and his writings that made him a celebrated writer. These included his Urdu teacher Maulvi saheb and the village storyteller, Kazaki whom Premchand remembered even on his death bed. It was on Wednesday evening that Rai, who is the grandson of Premchand’s younger brother Mahtab Rai, wrote on his social media account, “My grandfather Munshi Premchand, a Kayastha Hindu, learnt Urdu from Maulvi saheb.

Rai claimed he was only stating a fact from his grandfather’s life when he mentioned it on social media. When TOI contacted Rai, who is currently also writing a book on his grandfather, he said, “Premchand baba had started his education from a madrasa in Lalpur which was two kilometres from his village Lamhi. There at the madrasa he was taught Urdu and Persian by a Maulvi saheb.” The tweet by Premchand’s grandson, Pravir Rai went viral on Thursday.

Furthermore, it was an open position for which the teacher was selected by due process. Teaching or studying a language should not be decided on the basis of religion. What if Indians are asked to learn and teach foreign languages then? Where are we heading with this?” he questioned. "
Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh: Seven-year jail term for forced conversion in law panel draft,"LUCKNOW: Forced conversion in Uttar Pradesh may attract a jail term of up to seven years, while changing one’s religion for the sake of marriage may be nullified if either party contests it as ‘forced’. However, reconverting someone, as in ‘Ghar Vapsi’, may not be a crime at all. These recommendations are part of the state law commission’s draft bill on religious conversion submitted to the government on Thursday. Commission secretary Sapna Tripathi said in case of marriage where either party is forced to convert for the purpose, “both the conversion and marriage may be declared null and void”. The draft will be considered by the government which may then choose to adopt it in parts or entirety. Stressing that the current provisions of the IPC are not sufficient to prevent religious conversions, the law commission has drafted a new law, titled ‘The Uttar Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 2019’. In the submission to chief minister, chairman of state law commission Justice Aditya Nath Mittal said: “…katipay sangathan Hinduon, aur visheshkar anusoochit janjaati ke logon ko, pralobhan dekar apne nihit swarth hetu dharmantaran karakar Bharat ki sadiyon purani sabhyata dhara ko bhulane va dharmik paramparaon aur pooja paddhatiyon ka apmaan sikha kar apne dharm ko sarvochch shikhar par darshane ka kutsit prayaas kar rahe hain. (Some organisations are enticing Hindus, especially SC/STs, to convert for their own gains. In the process, these organisations are making people insult their religious traditions and rich culture).”In the past, largescale conversions took place under Mughal and British rules as the then rulers encouraged it, he adds. “There is no data as such to say how many forced conversions have taken place, but in 2014, CM Yogi Adityanath himself had raised the matter and we gave him a set of news clippings of the past six months to prove our point,” Tripathi said, adding at least 10 states have anti-conversion laws. Under the proposal, if one is found to have forcefully converted someone, the person can be jailed for a minimum of one year to a maximum of five years. However, if the person converted is a minor, woman or from SC/ST community, the jail term extends from two to seven years. The draft further stipulates that a person wishing to convert and the person who conducts the ceremony have to submit an application to DM or ADM a month before. The authorities will carry out a thorough investigation to determine the reason for conversion. There is a jail term of up to two years if one fails to inform the district administration about a proposed conversion. "

Lucknow,UP government to look for land after Sunni Waqf Board’s clarity,"LUCKNOW: The Ayodhya district administration has decided to put on hold its search for an alternative site for a mosque till Sunni Waqf Board expresses its intent to accept the 5-acre plot. The UP Sunni Waqf Board, which is split on accepting land or going for a review, is scheduled to meet on November 26 to hammer out a consensus. Sources in the government said preliminary work for identifying land for the mosque took place in the first week after the verdict. Now, they are waiting for clarity from the Sunni Waqf Board before offering options. “As per court’s directions, the district administration began work on identifying land, a day after the judgment. Now, the Board is unsure on accepting the offer so there’s no point going through the exercise in advance,” said a senior government official. A day after Supreme Court delivered the Ayodhya judgment, UP Sunni Waqf Board chairperson Zufar Faruqi had said the Board would not seek review, but would decide on the 5-acre plot after the Board meeting. “We had not sought an alternative site.

In most stories, people pined to visit what was once their ancestral homes and shared memories narrated by their parents or grandparents of pre-Partition India. Moeen, who now lives in Karachi, has narrated his parents love story. His mother, Maryam Jaffer was from Pune who defied family traditions to pursue education and was a topper. Her success story made it to the pages of the newspapers. Moeen’s father, Nooruddin Hassan Faruqi, a civil servant from Lucknow, saw Maryam’s picture in a newspaper and wrote to her.

Their marriage took place before Partition. In Pakistan, they found a house in Amil Colony that belonged to a Hindu family, who migrated to India. We grew up hearing stories of their families and lives in India,”(sic), wrote Moeen in the postcard. Manisha, whose parents migrated to India from Pakistan in 1947, got the idea of documenting such stories when she visited the neighbouring country in 2015 for an exhibition and found there were many like her who grew up listening to stories of pre-Partition India. “Then I decided to document stories that represent our common history,” she said. Like Moeen, Karachi-based sculptor and artist Adeela Suleman’s mother Shaheena Suleman also belonged to Lucknow. Writing on the postcard on behalf of her mother, Adeela, she mentions though Shaheena was a child during Partition, images of Lucknow are still fresh in her mind. She recalls how she was nicknamed Rani because she was born in the haveli of Raja Suggur, where monkeys frequented the ‘kathal’ tree in the haveli and how her mamujan would take her on his cycle for breakfast on Gomti Bridge. Meher Afroz’s parents migrated to Pakistan and left her in Lucknow with relatives to complete her studies. She moved to Karachi in 1965 after completing her studies in Lucknow’s Arts College. In her postcard, she weaves the image of the erstwhile Lucknow. “…And as soon as the tonga reached Daliganj bridge that crossed the Gomti river, I could see the magical view of rising minarets and the dome of historical buildings in the pouring rain (sic).” "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Gomtinagar taps gurgle muddy water, only day’s supply in store","LUCKNOW: Hundreds of households in Gomtinagar area are not only receiving inadequate water supply for nearly a month, they are also getting dirty water for last two days and the problem is expected to continue till Monday. Kathauta lake, the source of water supply to Gomtinagar, has turned shallow due to drop in water level after replenishment from Sharda Canal was stopped by irrigation department for dredging on October 28. Jal Sansthan had to lower the pipes close to the lake’s bed to draw water through pumps. In the process, pumps are also sucking in sand along with water. Executive engineer, Jal Sansthan, Ram Kailash said: “Water level should be 11-12 metres for proper supply but by Friday night it dropped to a metre. This means, just a day’s stock.

Action was also taken against another PCS officer, Ashok Kumar Lal, who was sacked after two charges of corruption against him were found true.

Kanpur,"Royal Bengal tiger treks 150km from Panna, spotted in Bundelkhand","JHANSI: Panic gripped the inhabitants of the villages on Mahoba-Hamirpur border in UP when they spotted a tiger in the fields on Friday afternoon. A resident of Gheodi village clicked the big cat and informed police and the local administration. Forest department officials swiftly rushed to the spot and set up a camp in the village and launched surveillance to ensure safety of villagers. Chief conservator of forests, Bundelkhand range, Pinaki Singh, told TOI, “It’s a Royal Bengal tiger which trekked more than 150km from Panna tiger reserve along the banks of Ken river. It’s our national animal and comes under Schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act 1972. Our team is camping here to rescue the tiger and take it back to the sanctuary. We have arranged cages from Kanpur for the rescue operation. This is first time that a Royal Bengal tiger has ventured in this area.” “The pugmarks lifted from the agricultural fields and the photos, though taken from a distance, suggest that it’s a sub-adult tiger, which may have just weaned off from its mother. And, in the process of survival and developing a territory, it has strayed a considerable distance. Generally, big cats like tiger move along river banks,” Singh added. “We have identified around seven villages in the vicinity of the spot where the tiger was last spotted and are focusing all our efforts there. We are carrying out activities like sensitization of locals, spreading awareness regarding tiger and its behaviour, dos and don’ts when a tiger is sighted, whom to inform about a direct or indirect sighting of a tiger,” Singh added.

Lucknow,Allahabad high court: Why engage contractual staff on regular posts?,"Lucknow: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High court has asked the state government to explain why it was engaging contractual employees against regular sanctioned posts through service providers and restrained it from continuing the practice till then. The court posted the matter on November 27 for next hearing. While seeking explanation from the state government, the bench, in an interim direction refrained the respondent from engaging service providers to provide contractual employees against regular sanctioned posts. A bench of Justice M N Bhandari and Justice V K Srivastava passed the order on a petition filed by a service provider firm M/s RMS Technosolutions Pvt Ltd. The petitioner challenged the October 25, 2019 order of state government cancelling its registration. Opposing the plea, state government said it had not just cancelled registration of petitioner but of all service provider firms to formulate a proper scheme to avoid any unfairness in engaging persons. In course of hearing, the court referred to the verdict rendered by the Supreme Court on petition of one Uma Devi 13 years ago, in which it had directed the Karnataka government not to indulge in ad hocism and rather had suggested to do away with it within six months.

Lucknow,"IAS Anurag Tiwari's death was accident, reiterates CBI","LUCKNOW: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has reiterated in court that the death of Karnataka-cadre IAS Anurag Tiwari was accidental and not murder. In its reply filed in CBI court on Friday, in response to the protest petition filed by Tiwari's younger brother Mayank in the first week of September, the premier investigative agency again submitted that the death was accidental. Latest CommentAfter so many incidents, regular news of unsolved murder, planned revenge and COVERUP-- UP Police has no credibility.SUBRATASee All CommentsAdd commentThe special CBI court has fixed December 3 as the next date of hearing. Karnataka cadre IAS officer, Anurag Tiwari (36) was found dead under mysterious circumstances outside the state guesthouse in Lucknow on May 17, 2017. CBI took over probe on June 17, 2017, and filed a murder case and filed a closure report on February 20, 2019 after investigating for 20 months. Mayank had challenged the closure report on September 17 pointing out several flaws in CBI probe and had raised several questions on its findings. Mayank's allegations are baseless and not backed by facts, CBI said in its reply. Probe was carried out scientifically while assistance of a panel of doctors from AIIMS, Delhi, and CFSL was sought. All the recovered documents were scrutinised and showed no threat perception from any senior officers or politicians. Hence, it was concluded that Tiwari met an accident. Mayank's counsel Nutan Thakur said the unanswered questions include sudden change of WhatsApp number, cancellation of flight for Bengaluru on May 16, hours after booking and then booking another flight via Kolkata besides many others.

Lucknow,‘Ayushmann says for me ki ‘yeh ladki single kyun hai?'’ Nushrat Bharucha in Lucknow,"After reigning over the big screen with her performance in the hit film 'Dream Girl', which also starred Ayushmann Kkhurrana, actress Nushrat Bharucha is all set to rule the Box Office with her upcoming films 'Turram Khan' and 'Hurdang', among other projects. The actress has been working back-to-back and on a recent work trip to Lucknow, Nushrat spoke at length about her journey in the industry and how things have changed for her since her Kartik Aaryan starrer 'Sonu ke Titu Ki Sweety' (SKTKS). Q. You were recently shooting for Hurdang in Allahabad and now you’re in Lucknow. What brings you to here?Honestly, I can’t speak about my project just yet but you’ll know with time for sure. It’s something unique, and hopefully you’ll like it. Speaking of Lucknow, I had the most scrumptious food here. The day we landed, we went to Dastarkhwan and had all the amazing dishes that were offered to us right from galawati kebabs, laccha parantha, mutton korma to shami kebabs with some special parantha that is meant to be had with those kebabs only. We even had the famous Tundey kebabs and biryani with the boondi raita and pineapple raita. After that, we went to Nirulas and had the hot chocolate fudge with extra chocolate sauce and extra nuts. Itna sab khaaya aur phir bharke gym kiya. Q. Life seems to have taken off since SKTKS for you.NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Yes, I’m very happy with what’s come my way because I always felt that the biggest reward is when you get the option of choices and specially good choices. I think the fact that good choices of films meri taraf aayi, where I could pick them, was quite rewarding. Sometimes what happens is that you really want to do a certain film but it isn’t offered to you, you can’t do much in a situation like that. I believe I should pick different kinds of roles, even if the film concept is not so new. The character should be different. Every actor wants to do roles jahan unko mazaa aaye, of course. All my films are consciously different from each other, joh abhi aayengi, 'Dream Girl' was different, 'Turram Khan' is absolutely different, 'Hurdang' is altogether a different ballgame. I was astoundingly offered three completely different films back-to-back. It was also about discovering whether I could do those types of films or not. There were questions in my mind like how will I perform? How will I adapt? Darr bhi lagta hai but mujhe usmein mazaa bahot aata hai. So I had to do those films, there was no two ways about it but to say yes to those projects. Nushrat Bharucha with Ayushmann Khurrana in Dream Girl (BCCL)  Nushrat Bharucha with Ayushmann Khurrana in Dream Girl (BCCL) Q. Were you not apprehensive saying yes to a movie in which Ayushmann was starring, considering that he tends to own a film completely?For me, who owns a film from an actor’s point of view has never been the reason to take a script on or to even let that thought enter my brain. Mere liye film sabse badi hoti hai. If I’m enjoying a film when it’s being narrated to me, I want to be a part of it. I’m like mazaa aayega and this has to be credited to me in some way even if the story is about a boy who is taking the entire story ahead. For me, I found 'Dream Girl' so funny, I was laughing the first one hour of the narration. He (director Raaj Shaandilyaa) didn’t even have to wait one day, I said I want to do this film, and I personally felt that the film will do well. When you have such a strong vibe and connect with a film, phir aur kuchh dimaag mein aata nahi hai. My criteria for selecting a film is ki kuchh alag karne ko mila and I’ll enjoy doing the film, I know. The story and script play a crucial role while saying yes to a film for me. Q. You have been in Bollywood for quite some time now. Now, do you think you’re finally getting your due in the industry?I live by this thought, ‘waqt se pehle, waqt se zyaada kisi ko nahi milta’. So agar yeh waqt tha and itna milna tha toh mila. I cannot sit today and say ‘Oh! Now I’ve got my due’. Maybe not, maybe two years later I’ll get more. I mean there is no reason to put yourself in those thoughts. There are so many other productive thoughts that you can concentrate on to build yourself better. I’m thankful that I get to play different kinds of roles and I enjoy the work that I do. I don’t want to be on a set where I’m not enjoying. That’s the only thing I would dread. Q. You’re a product of non-nepotism and you’re hanging out and are friends with people who have been blamed for nepotism. How does it feel?I’m not from nepotism but I’m still friends with people who apparently were blamed for that. I am close to Manish (Malhotra), I’m really close to him. So doesn’t it take away from the fact that maybe they were blamed wrongly? I feel like these are just tags and labels people give which is okay. Every individual is entitled to their own set of opinions and I have mine. I’ve already spoken a lot on nepotism. Manish (Malhotra, fashion designer) out of nowhere picked up the phone, when he's never met me, he’s only seen my film and said ‘Come and do my show’. It is a genuine bond that I share with him. We don’t know each other from anywhere. I’m not a model, in fact, I don’t even have the height for one and yet he calls me for a fashion show. He was just like mazaa aayega and ever since I walked for his show, we’ve just been friends. Sophie Choudhary happens to be another really chill friend who I love hanging out with along with Rajkummar Rao, Patralekha, Diana Penty, Pooja, Suraj and Siddharth Malhotra. There’s like a bunch and mix of people who are there and then we’re just partying. There are no barriers, we have a great time. I love that space, that’s the kind of vibe I like. Nushrat Bharucha in Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety (BCCL)  Nushrat Bharucha in Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety (BCCL) Q. Two of your films have touched the 100 crore mark. So are you expecting the same from your upcoming films as well?This 100 crores has become like a tag that people give for a successful film. But what does it translate into? If I have to look at it from the grass-root level, so many people have seen your film, meaning so many people have liked you, which means so many people have wanted to watch you more. Aapka fan base badhta hai, you connect with so many people. I only think of it in a way that I was able to reach so many more people than my previous film. That’s how it translates for me as an actor as of now. The audience is your main judge, they have the power to make you and break you. The fact that it is reaching so many people is great. Q. How has Nushrat changed post SKTKS’ success?I won’t say I have changed changed. But yes, I have just learnt how to judge people better, if I may say so. I’m the same person but what I’ve learnt is to understand who you’re talking to and what your relationship with the person is and deal with them accordingly. That was my learning process. Q. Kangana has been all flags for pay parity. What about you? Does that thought prop in your mind?I have just come to this industry. We were a bunch of complete newcomers. I haven’t worked with a big star wherein I would understand the difference in pay as such. I feel like I’m still nascent in this journey. I feel like it’ll take me a while to come to a place where an issue like this becomes my issue also. Having said that, I’m all for people who are standing up for it and making a path for us to maybe take. Priyanka Chopra is very inspiring, I feel. I remember Priyanka said this to me and it really stuck. She said ‘If I have done this, it should be more of a motivation for you all to kind of take that path because I paved the way, you’ve just got to walk the correct path now.’ So I feel someone has paved a path for me and one day hopefully I pave a path for someone else. Who inspires who and when is the point. Someone’s going to have an impact on you and one day you’ll probably be creating a similar impact on someone else. Q. Anything happening on the personal front?I’m still single. Honestly I haven’t even had the time since 'Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety'. I feel that void of not having that special someone when I’m watching a movie, perhaps. Those basic times I feel I wish I had someone but my friends easily fill in that gap. You always have people. I don’t mind dating someone from within or outside the industry, it's irrelevant. I just need to like the guy. Even Ayush (Ayusshmann) says that a lot, he says, ‘Yeh ladki single kyun hai? Thought process correct hai, balanced hai’, it's funny'! Eventually even Ayush agrees that we should ask the guys what the problem is. Nushrat Bharucha in Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)  Nushrat Bharucha in Lucknow (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Q. Any plans of getting married?I definitely want to get married but not anytime soon. Also, I want to adopt kids. If my partner and I mutually agree for the same it’ll be great, if not, I don’t mind being a single mother, either. I’d absolutely love to adopt kids and, I will. — With inputs from Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,Indian celebrities are still not used to the idea of roasting in comedy: Shobhit Sinha,"In Lucknow some time back for a surprise birthday party for his mom, comedy writer Shobhit Sinha was on cloud nine as he had bagged a Bollywood film as a solo dialogue writer. ""I am right now doing a film with debut director Ishrat Khan as a dialogue writer, who has been an associate director with Anees Bazmee sir. The film’s name is Salman Tune Shadi Kyun Ki. It is a comedy film. The cast is yet to be finalised but the concept is quite interesting of the film. It is about the privacy of a newlywed couple in Mumbai as they are living in a joint family and the house is quite small. Interestingly, I have picked up a lot of funny punches from my experience of living in Lucknow. In a city like Lucknow you will get many such cases too. In fact, a lot of my humour comes from Lucknow. Even in my animation show Honey Bunny Ka Jholmaal, I try to incorporate my Lakhnawi humour,"" he said. Shobhit Sinha (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Shobhit Sinha (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) There were once several comedy shows, especially stand-up ones doing very good on TV. In fact, every channel had a show. But of late we only have The Kapil Sharma Show on air. ""Yeh sirf time-time ki baat hai. The pitching for several comedy shows on different channels is still on and soon you will see many more comedy shows back on air. Most of the comedy shows are there for only a few months only. Even Comedy Night Bachao was there for only a limited time,"" says Shobhit. The Lucknow lad adds, “But Comedy Nights Bachao, which was on the concept of roasting, didn’t go down well with a lot of celebrities who appeared on it, with a few even leaving the show mid-way. “Yes, the show was a little bit too much for the Indian celebrities, who are still not used to the whole idea of roasting. But we will soon be coming up with another season of the show, which will be a mellowed down version to suit the Indian sensibilities.

But while agreeing that the court order is judicially flawed, we strongly believe that keeping the Ayodhya dispute alive will harm, and not help, Indian Muslims,” said the statement. Javed Anand, who is also secretary of Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy, said it is high time the Muslims moved away from the mandir-masjid dispute as it helps to mask the real agenda of the Sangh Parivar, which is to replace the secular-democratic republic with a Hindu Rashtra.

Lucknow,"African worm, ivory from Indian riverbed wow visitors at Lucknow University","LUCKNOW: From 85-year-old electric fish specimens brought from Brazil to the world’s longest elephant tusk, measuring 3.54 metre, found in the Yamuna riverbed at Kalpi — rare exhibits made jaws drop at Lucknow University on Monday. To mark the beginning of its centenary year, the varsity opened doors of its zoology, geology and anthropology museums to the common man. On display were objects and specimens collected painstakingly by eminent professors from across the country and abroad in the past 90-100 years. Although the turnout was low, the unique collection fascinated those who did visit the campus. “I had heard from my brother that LU’s zoology museum is among the best in the country. So, when the varsity opened its gates to students from outside, I decided not to miss the opportunity,” said Pragati Shashwat who studies at a private engineering college. If a 1.5-metre earthworm brought from Africa around 85 years ago fuelled intrigue, skeletons of various animals including a tiger and a tapir upped the curiosity quotient no less. Retired banker Anirudh Malhotra, on the other hand, was completely taken by rare fossils and gems at the geology museum. “I have never seen such a collection before. The world’s longest tusk, oldest fossil and the most unique rocks — you name it and LU has it,” he said. The anthropology museum flaunted artefacts of various tribes, including Tharu (from Nepal and eastern India) and those from Andaman and Nicobar islands, to engage visitors. Besides outsiders, LU alumni from the 1969, 1987 and 1991 batches too thronged all the museums on Monday. "

Lucknow,Vishwa Hindu Parishad to record memoirs of Ram temple movement for posterity,"LUCKNOW: Vishwa Hindu Parishad has started cataloguing minute details of events during the Ram temple movement that eventually led to demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya and people who took part in it.

Under the Smart City mission, the city must complete 57 projects by 2024. Out of these, only three projects have been completed so far by the designated wing of Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) while work is in progress for 36 others. The LMC is yet to launch the remaining 18 projects. According to civic officials, smart bus shelters, a command and control centre and solar panel installation at five government buildings are complete.

The accident took place near Semri village under Tindawari police station. The bus ferrying passengers from Banda to Fatehpur was hit by the speeding truck with force, ripping apart its body on the right side, and leaving behind a macabre sight. Police officials said the accident was so severe that nine persons, including four women, four men and an eight-year old girl, died on the spot with some bodies thrown out of the bus. Additional SP Banda, Lal Bharat Pal, said, “Out of 32 injured, five sustained grievous injuries and were referred to Kanpur medical college, while 12 others were admitted to district hospital.

Lucknow,"Rebel Congress veterans say expulsion invalid, pin hopes on Sonia Gandhi for justice","LUCKNOW: The 10 senior Congress leaders expelled from party on charges of indiscipline contested the action on Monday, saying their expulsion is against party constitution and they plan to meet party president Sonia Gandhi in next four-five days. The veterans, who were all AICC members, had been grumbling against their sidelining in recent state unit revamp with Ajay Kumar Lallu being appointed UPCC president. Former MLC Siraj Mehdi, at whose residence the seniors met on Monday, said, “The youngsters in party too would age at some point like us. Will they also be similarly discarded by Congress? We are not against the youth, but want to know what part is there for us in the plan.” Mehdi challenged the expulsion saying they did not even receive the notice the party claims to have sent. “We held a meeting on November 14 and November 21, and read in papers that a notice has been sent to us. None of us have received it till now, so there is no question of responding to it. The expulsion order says the party was ‘not satisfied’ with our response even though we never sent a response,” Mehdi said.

Satyadev Tripathi, a former minister, said, “Now, we will hold discussions with cadres on the state of Congress.

Lucknow,"UP: BJP invokes Dr BR Ambedkar, goes to 75 dists for Dalit outreach","LUCKNOW: While the government is convening a special UP assembly session to mark the Constitution Day on Tuesday, BJP will use the occasion to make a Dalit outreach in all 75 UP districts. UP BJP will organise programmes to highlight the contribution of Dr BR Ambedkar, who played a pivotal role in the drafting of the Constitution, and the party’s efforts to improve the lot of Dalits. Sources in UP BJP said the party has planned workshops and mass contact programmes in Dalit-dominated pockets of all districts from Tuesday which will continue till November 30. The party brass has asked all its MPs, MLAs and senior party functionaries to participate in programmes which will essentially revolve around Ambedkar and his contribution in nation-building and how BJP leadership has been acknowledging his efforts. A year after the BJP stormed to power at the Centre in 2014, the government, through a gazette notification, declared November 26 as Constitution Day. It was on this day in 1949 that the Constituent Assembly of India adopted the Constitution of India which came into effect on January 26, 1950. In charge of state BJP’s SC/ST Morcha Govind Narayan Shukla said the objective of programmes would not only be to highlight Ambedkar’s contribution in nation-building but also BJP’s efforts towards Dalit emancipation through government welfare schemes. “Special focus will be on BJP’s efforts towards developing centres associated with Ambedkar as Panch Teerth,” Shukla told TOI. He said the five-day programme would be aimed at galvanizing Dalits who were being used as a vote bank by opposition parties. According to sources in the party, BJP aims to consolidate its position among Dalits after losing Zaidpur reserved seat to Samajwadi Party in the recently held by-elections. The party, however, managed to retain two other reserved seats – Balha and Iglas. "

In 2018-19, as many as 248 companies had lined up for recruitment, which has come down to 170 this season. Some of the leading firms that visit IITs every year are likely to stay away during the placement season starting December. Many sought-after ‘Day One’ firms, which typically offer hefty packages, have either declined requests from placement cells of the institutes or are yet to confirm their interest. Asked why fewer firms had registered this time, IIT Madras said “the reasons will be addressed during Day 1 of placements”. The job profiles have also shrunk from 490 last year to 322 this time. The 322 profiles include 35 international job profiles. A total of 1,334 students have registered for placements. IIT-Madras, however, expects some good tidings as 158 students have already got job offers as against 135 last year.

While I was shooting for the song, he asked me if I would like to do the costumes for his next film Shiva. But the interesting part is that though I had done more than 25 films, the stamp of approval for my parents came after the Filmfare award which I won last year for Konkona Sen Sharma’s A Death In The Gunj. They always wanted me to win an award like a Filmfare, they wanted that validation more than me wishing for it."" So how was it winning your first Filmfare award? ""I was shivering holding that black lady in my hand; it is the best feeling in the world. We are a very external looking industry, so an award like Filmfare does matter and yes it changes people’s perception towards the person. People who are close to me, for them nothing has changed but yes for a lot of other people, they look at me in a different manner now. Somebody giving you a little more respect, well, that is how I look at it. The best part of it is that someone like me is getting a Filmfare for Best Costume category, who doesn’t have a degree in Fashion,"" says Rohit. So does a degree in fashion matters then? ""Well, today a lot of fashion students come to me as interns, you know not that I am undermining education at all, it is very very important, but you can’t cultivate that germ in you if you don’t have it.

I have studied in UP Kirana Seva Samiti Vidyalaya Public School in Kanpur. I am still in touch with the principal of my school of my time, Renuka Gulati. After I won the Filmfare award, a lot of my teachers got in touch with me on Facebook and we are back in touch now. I miss Kanpur ki Tewari Ki Chaat on Birhana road and the laddoos the most."" Rohit feels that as a costumer designer of a film, it isn’t that difficult for him to make clothes for them if he has earned their trust. “Makeup and costumes are so personal to celebrities that you can’t externally look at it and say they are easy. You have to earn their trust. An artist is the face of the medium or a film and is the most insecure, as well. They are very particular about who they are getting designed by. I have worked with the ‘so-called’ difficult celebrities but they were not difficult with me. We do take inputs from actors but how much of it we incorporate them is upto us. But you have to give their opinion a validation,” he says. After the film Manjunath, where the characters were from Lucknow, this is Rohit’s second film in which he will be designing costumes for Lakhnawi characters. “Lucknowites’ dressing is very interesting. Though the dressing has evolved of UPites, we still have a rawness in our dressing style which people will get to see in Pagglait. Giving you a small example, women here used to wear woollen blouses with saris in winters and since our film is set in the winter season you will get to see such small small detailing in the actor’s clothes,” smiles Rohit.

My first proper celebrity styling was for the celebs who featured on the show The Great Indian Comedy Show. I did styling for celebs like Suchitra Pillai, Ranveer Shorey, among others. I also did costumes for a few music albums.""

While I was shooting for the song, he asked me if I would like to do the costumes for his next film Shiva. But the interesting part is that though I had done more than 25 films, the stamp of approval for my parents came after the Filmfare award which I won last year for Konkona Sen Sharma’s A Death In The Gunj. They always wanted me to win an award like a Filmfare, they wanted that validation more than me wishing for it."" So how was it winning your first Filmfare award? ""I was shivering holding that black lady in my hand; it is the best feeling in the world. We are a very external looking industry, so an award like Filmfare does matter and yes it changes people’s perception towards the person. People who are close to me, for them nothing has changed but yes for a lot of other people, they look at me in a different manner now. Somebody giving you a little more respect, well, that is how I look at it. The best part of it is that someone like me is getting a Filmfare for Best Costume category, who doesn’t have a degree in Fashion,"" says Rohit. So does a degree in fashion matters then? ""Well, today a lot of fashion students come to me as interns, you know not that I am undermining education at all, it is very very important, but you can’t cultivate that germ in you if you don’t have it. Somebody can give you a degree but nobody can give you the talent to survive with that degree. I never really felt that lack of having a fashion degree,"" he shares. Rohit Chaturvedi (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Rohit Chaturvedi (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav) Ask him about his days spent in Kanpur and he says, ""My family has not shifted to Mumbai with me. I was in Kanpur a really long time ago some 14 years, I guess. But I seriously wish to go back there soon. I have so many fond memories of my hometown. I have studied in UP Kirana Seva Samiti Vidyalaya Public School in Kanpur. I am still in touch with the principal of my school of my time, Renuka Gulati. After I won the Filmfare award, a lot of my teachers got in touch with me on Facebook and we are back in touch now. I miss Kanpur ki Tewari Ki Chaat on Birhana road and the laddoos the most."" Rohit feels that as a costumer designer of a film, it isn’t that difficult for him to make clothes for them if he has earned their trust. “Makeup and costumes are so personal to celebrities that you can’t externally look at it and say they are easy. You have to earn their trust. An artist is the face of the medium or a film and is the most insecure, as well. They are very particular about who they are getting designed by. I have worked with the ‘so-called’ difficult celebrities but they were not difficult with me. We do take inputs from actors but how much of it we incorporate them is upto us. But you have to give their opinion a validation,” he says. After the film Manjunath, where the characters were from Lucknow, this is Rohit’s second film in which he will be designing costumes for Lakhnawi characters. “Lucknowites’ dressing is very interesting. Though the dressing has evolved of UPites, we still have a rawness in our dressing style which people will get to see in Pagglait. Giving you a small example, women here used to wear woollen blouses with saris in winters and since our film is set in the winter season you will get to see such small small detailing in the actor’s clothes,” smiles Rohit.

Lucknow,Congress created hurdles for Ram temple: Yogi Adityanath,"Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath accused Congress party of creating hurdles in way of Ram temple construction in Ayodhya. Addressing election rally in Garhwa and Bhavnathpur assembly seats in Jharkhand on Wednesday, CM Yogi said BJP paved the way for temple construction and raised the ‘gaurav’ (pride) of India. “A grand temple of Lord Ram is all set to be constructed, thereby showing the strength of democracy and judiciary,” he said, amid loud chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ by BJP supporters. Targeting Congress, Yogi said, “Everyone knows that parties like Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal are here only to create problems.

BJP government also brought a law to ban triple talaq in a big relief to Muslim women, he added.

Track the pollution level in your cityThe improvement was so dramatic that PM2.5 levels stayed below the safe limit of 60 micrograms/cubic metre from just after 7pm on Tuesday till around 9am on Wednesday. The clean-up was the result of rainfall in the northern plains, with strong northwesterly winds bringing clean air into Delhi-NCR.

As per CPCB’s 24-hour average data, the last time Delhi-NCR’s PM2.5 level was in safe zone was on October 19. Later, most parts of Delhi received light rain in the afternoon, along with hail in some parts of NCR. The AQI improved to ‘moderate’ – a level last seen on October 9, when monsoon had yet to withdraw. Cleaner air: Good news at 20km / hrWhile Delhi’s AQI was recorded at 270 (poor) on Tuesday, it fell to 134 (moderate) in the next 24 hours – the lowest reading since October 8, when the AQI was recorded at 112 (moderate). Met officials said a number of factors helped the cleaning up the air, with a spell of rain over the last two days in the northern plains negating the impact of stubble burning. Good wind speed did not allow the moisture levels to increase and trap pollutants, officials said. “Wind speed was around 15-20 km/hour on Wednesday which along with the rain has helped settle pollutants. Wind speed is expected to drop slightly on Thursday, but it will slow down only on November 29,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD. The Safdarjung observatory, the city’s main weather station, recorded ‘trace’ rainfall till 5.30pm, while Jafarpur in northwest Delhi received the most rainfall at 7mm. Srivastava said parts of Ghaziabad and north Delhi recorded hailstorm activity, a phenomenon not uncommon at this time of the year. “Good wind speed and rain in the region have not allowed the moisture content to increase and trap pollutants. While wind speeds will dip by November 29, the deterioration in air quality will not be significant as the impact of rain will continue,” said Srivastava. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said the air quality would remain in the ‘moderate’ range on Thursday before slipping to the ‘poor’ range on Friday. “Under the influence of a western disturbance, precipitation recorded in Delhi and its north-western regions has led to washing out of suspended pollutants and rapid improvement in air quality. The SAFAR model forecast suggests AQI is likely to be on the moderate category for tomorrow. Marginal deterioration to poor AQI category is forecast for November 29,” said SAFAR. In NCR, Gurugram was the cleanest with an AQI of 104 (moderate) in the last 24 hours, while Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad all recorded ‘moderate’ AQI. While Delhi’s minimum temperature was 14.5 degrees, met officials say mercury is likely to fall to around 12 degrees by November 30 and to 10 degrees by December 1. "

Rajiv, a resident of Kalyanpur, claims to be brother of Deepa Kovind, daughter-in-law of President Kovind. He also holds the post of state vice-president of the Sena, a social organization named after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The threat assumes significance in view of President Kovind’s visit to the city on November 30. He is scheduled to attend functions at CSJM University, Kanpur Nagar Nigam (KNN) and a private institute in Bhaunti area of the district. “I received a WhatsApp call at around 2 pm on my mobile phone. The number displayed on my screen was of Pakistan — 92-3096943288. When I picked up the call, the caller started threatening and asked me to disassociate myself with NaMo Sena. He also threatened to blow up my family using RDX if I did not listen to him,” Rajiv told TOI.

It seems the call was made to terrorise the complainant,” the officer added. “Though 92 is Pakistan code, I believe that it could be the handiwork of someone known to the complainant or could also be a spoof call. However, we are not taking any chance and have provided police security to the complainant,” the CO added. "

Kanpur,NHAI to begin repair work on Old Ganga bridge today,"KANPUR: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to start the repair work of the Old Ganga bridge in Jajmau from Friday. The decision was taken after a recent inspection. There would, however, be no restriction on the movement of vehicles on the bridge, though traffic is likely to be affected during the repair period. Over 40-year-old bridge connecting Kanpur and Lucknow via Unnao needs major repairs, including the road. A recent inspection revealed that the joint bearings were damaged, road had developed potholes and at many places Ganga flowing beneath the bridge could be seen through damaged portions of the bridge. Talking to TOI, project director, NHAI, Purshottam Lal Chaudhary said that the maintenance work on the Ganga bridge would commence from Friday.

Lucknow,Agra gets first microbrewery in Uttar Pradesh,"LUCKNOW: Agra has become the first city in the state where one will be able to savour freshly brewed draught beer. The excise department is in the process of clearing five more applications for a microbrewery, one of which is for Lucknow and should be granting licences in the coming weeks. The MB-5 licence granted to a restaurant in Agra for setting up of a microbrewery is the first such licence issued by the government under the newly amended UP Brewery Rules of 1961. The city was selected, say officials, due to the large flow of both foreign and domestic tourists in the city known for the Taj Mahal. “There is a huge demand for freshly brewed beer because of which the state had brought this policy. States like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana have had provisions for microbreweries for some time now and this will encourage both tourism and employment generation in the state,” said a senior official. He added that the government was processing five more applications and would grant more licences as and when they received more applications.

Lucknow,Niti Aayog thumbs-up to Kumbh Mela for economy boost,"LUCKNOW: The organisation of the 2019 Kumbh Mela in Allahabad has received a thumbs-up from the Niti Aayog. Calling the arrangements a huge success, a Niti Ayog report has said that the Mela was not only successful in promoting economic activity in the state, boosting the country’s image and tourism, and increasing local employment generation, it also showcased “the grandeur that is India, to the world, besides demonstrating the organizational skills of the state government”. The report was prepared after a team of Niti Aayog officials visited Allahabad in April this year to study how the mega event was executed. The Mela was held from January 15 to March 4. The report says that the team documented various aspects of the Mela’s organisation, including institutional arrangement, infrastructure, development of the Mela area, use of technology for intelligent traffic management and disaster management. The team also called the Mela “the best example of crowd management and cleanliness in the world”. The Mela, says the report, was marketed not just as a religious event but also as a major cultural and social event.

Lucknow,"Tejas hurtles into big row, 20 crew members sacked amid hush-up cry","LUCKNOW: Indian Railways’ first corporate train, Tejas Express, chugged into a controversy after 20 members of its crew were allegedly sacked within a month of its high-profile flag-off. Eleven women and nine men, who were part of the launch crew are now on a warpath after they were shown the door on November 4. They claimed, no reason was attributed for retrenchment. While most employees alleged they were made to work on a gruelling 18-hour shift, some women crew members claimed they were harassed by passengers, but their complaints were ignored. Avantika Bajpai, who was deputed manager of a 48-strong team, told TOI, “We were hired by the contractor, Brindavan Food Products, on September 25 and trained to serve passengers of Tejas Express. We would do an 18-hour shift daily, without rest.

IRCTC, which is operating the train, had created an all-woman WhatsApp group in October, stating that any woman attendant can seek consultation or assistance when in distress. The group was formed after it was reported by media about a craze among passengers to click selfies with train stewardess, which was sometimes very unpleasant. “We were added to the official WhatsApp group of Tejas Express, where we would record our attendance. But, after a month, 20 of us were removed from service. On November 13, we were also removed from the official WhatsApp group ‘Tejas Crew’,” said Avantika. Namrata Mishra, who also lost her job, said, “The salary quoted in our appointment letters was Rs 10,500, but we were given much less than what was promised. Some were given Rs 6,500 while some were handed out Rs 7,000 or 8,000. When we lodged a verbal complaint with Shubhangi ma'am and Aman Sir (from the agency which hired the women), we were told the salary has been credited according to our working days. We were told the salary was being given by RK Group.” “When we were hired, we were told about a day’s off after an 18-hour shift, but after one week, we were asked to do an 18-hour shift daily. We were also threatened that if we raised our voice about working conditions, we will be fired,” she said.

Lucknow,Constable’s foot patrol effective policing: Kiran Bedi,"LUCKNOW: It was a DSP, junior by rank but 20 years her senior in age, who taught former ace cop and Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi one of the most important lessons of her professional life—beat policing. Speaking at the inaugural session of the 47th All India Police Science Congress at UP Police headquarters on Thursday, the retired IPS officer recalled how one KK Chhabra had told her that it was by repositioning constables that she could fulfil her dream of preventing crime. “Constables and head constables must get centre stage in policing while officers should guide them,” said Bedi. In her 22-minute interaction, Bedi said that constables and head constables must be nurtured and also given protection, adding that policing should be thought about from their perspective. “When I started my career as a district in charge, I wanted to prevent crime, come what may. Chhabra told me: Madam aap bahut peeche padi hai prevention ke. Ye aise nahi hone wala, ye sab beat policing se hoga (Madam, you would only be able to prevent crime through beat policing),” she said. “It is always crime prevention and then detection...If beat system is judiciously followed, then crime would be monitored automatically and hotspots of crime would be visible,” she added. These days, nobody follows the beat system, she said.

Even if a law and order situation arises or an emergency situation comes up, the beat system must not be disturbed,” she said. Constables should be encouraged to file daily reports about what’s happening in their areas and senior policemen should interact with lower rung cops daily, she said. “I used to accompany constables on walks in the areas allocated to them. I used to reward them based on how many people used to greet them with a ‘namaste’.” “My research shows that attending the roll-call and through exchange of information, 100% beat officers knew what was happening in the city. The same system needs to be implemented across the country to improve detection of crime,” the 70-year-old said. The 70-year-old also said that an officer must consider ‘khaki’ similar to a temple/mosque/gurdwara/church (place of worship). Referring to the Ayodhya case, Bedi said she was looking at the developments with a sense of nervousness. She complimented the Uttar Pradesh Police for ensuring that the situation remained under control after the verdict. “This and the success of Kumbh Mela have done the country proud. I wish there was a Magsaysay award for the police for these achievements,” she said. She also said that UP DGP should interact with each police station in the state via video conferencing. “Nyay aur himmat (justice and courage) must be the motto of every police officer,” she said.

Lucknow,‘Bring forensic course to crack sex crime’,"LUCKNOW: At the conclusion of each session conducted at the 47th Police Science Congress being held in Lucknow, two resolutions will be drafted and adopted after discussion. These will then be read out in front of Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday for implementation at policy-making level, said Renuka Mishra, ADG, recruitment &amp; promotion board, UP Police. On Thursday, the first resolution in the session on women’s safety was about investigation of sexual crimes against women. The resolution says that medical examination of a victim, as required in criminal investigation of sexual crimes, should be taught in detail as part of the curriculum in medical schools. While forensic medicine exists, the depth of the subject is such that there should be an entire course or specialisation in it. The idea came from Amol Deshmukh, a Mumbai-based forensic and investigation expert, who is also an adviser in the Union ministry of home affairs.

If medical examination is not done correctly, even compensation that is due to the victim is denied because rape is not confirmed by medical examination even if it has taken place. Forensic gynaecology subject should be introduced as a branch of study,” said Deshmukh. He also said that courses specific to sexual offences against children need to pay more attention in medical education. Additionally, refresher courses in medico-legal examination should be held for doctors because the nature of sexual crimes has changed over the years.

The second resolution was regarding strict implementation of Supreme Court regulations on sale and purchase of acid to prevent acid attacks, most of the victims of which are women. The regulations include asking the acid buyer for what purpose is the product being purchased and also the the seller recording details of the person in the form of an ID, among others.

We never contested this,” AIMPLB secretary and Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) convener advocate Zafaryab Jilani told TOI. “However, since the idol was illegally placed under the Babri Masjid’s central dome, thereby desecrating it as observed by the Supreme Court, it cannot become a deity when on someone else’s property,” said Jilani. Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid case verdict, as it happened: HighlightsNEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.The idol of Ram Lalla was placed inside Babri Masjid in the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949, an act which SC has termed illegal in its November 9 verdict. “The deity had judicial rights to fight for its property when it was worshipped at the Ram Chabutra from 1885 to 1949,” said Jilani. ‘1949 FIR stated idol was forcibly placed’But SC accepts that the mosque was not an abandoned one and Muslims offered namaz in it from 1857 till 1949. SC also recorded that the idol was illegally and forcefully placed inside the mosque’s central dome in 1949. When the act of placing the idol was deemed illegal, can the idol become a deity?” asked Jilani. The Muslim side, which is currently drafting the review petition, said this is a point that has not been touched upon in the legal proceedings till now. And, it will be this point on which the review plea will be based, added Jilani. Jilani went on to claim that such an idol, which was forcefully placed inside another’s rightful property, does not assume sanctity even under Hindu rituals and culture. “According to Hindu traditions, an idol is only an idol until ‘praan-pratishtha’ (the ritual of infusing life in an idol, turning it into a deity) is conducted and it is consecrated inside a temple,” said Jilani. “A deity would not encroach upon another person’s land. A person or body that has encroached upon another’s land, cannot lay claim on that property,” he said. SC verdict on Ayodhya: Sunni Central Waqf Board won't file review petition“Also, Hindu traditions do not bestow sanctity on an idol or consider it pious if the idol is established illegally on a piece of land. We will raise this contradiction in court,” Jilani explained. He told TOI that the FIR lodged in 1949 mentioned that the idol was forcibly placed inside the Babri Masjid in the intervening night of December 22 and 23. This, Jilani said, was also accepted in court by the Uttar Pradesh government and the Faizabad district administration as well as police officials. AIMPLB will file review plea against SC's Ayodhya verdict before Dec 9: Zafaryab Jilani“Even the Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court had not given the status of deity to these idols in its 2010 order,” he said. “Since SC accepted the idol as a deity, it became the main premise for the judgment. The outcome can be different if our point is legally considered,” said Jilani.

Lucknow,UP’s coffers to disburse farm insurance directly,"LUCKNOW: The UP government is all set to directly disburse insurance benefits to farmers and the poor from its coffers and shut out private insurance companies to cut red tape. A proposal from the revenue board has already been sent to the CM’s office and is likely to be approved soon, despite a powerful lobby of insurance firms working overtime to stall the proposal. The proposal states insurance companies deliberately delayed or denied insurance cover of the state government to farmers and below-poverty-line (BPL) people and those who were insured were running from pillar to post to get relief, but companies remained insensitive to their concerns, said the proposal from the revenue board.

Initially, it was limited to farmers, but later the Yogi government expanded the security net to those earning below Rs 75,000 per annum. Uttar Pradesh being an agriculture-based economy with highest number of farmers (11crore) and a huge BPL population, the state government launched a scheme in 2012 to provide insurance cover to farmers. Initially, the scheme provided Rs1 lakh cover to farmers, but later it was augmented to Rs 5 lakh in case of death and Rs 2.5 lakh for permanent disability, apart from treatment in empanelled hospitals up to Rs 5 lakh. The Yogi government, however, rechristened the scheme to MMKSBY in 2017, providing insurance cover to farmers by paying premium to insurance firms from its budgetary provision. Initially, the scheme was implemented by the institutional finance department, but later the revenue board supervised and implemented it. However, the revenue board was flooded with complaints from officials in the district that insurance companies were harassing farmers and the poor and denying benefits on trivial grounds, despite the state paying premium. Speaking to the TOI, a senior official in the revenue board shared that in FY 2017, the insurance companies received 20,803 claims, but only 13,867 received insurance benefits while 6,113 were denied on flimsy ground. In FY-2018, 24,726 claims were received, but only 14,868 got relief and 8,595 people were denied or kept in tenterhooks by the insurance firms. Similarly in FY-2019, while 24,321 claimed insurance, only 11,340 received benefits and a large number of 7,804 people were denied. While the delay and denial was done by insurance firms, BPL and farmers put the blame on the state government. “By denying insurance, companies ploughed in huge profits from the government’s social-safety scheme,” said a senior officer of the revenue board. Keeping this in mind, the state government decided to cast aside insurance firms from its flagship scheme and provide benefits through the office of district magistrates. Talking to TOI, chairman of the Revenue Board, Deepak Trivedi, confirmed that a proposal has been sent to the chief minister office for approval and the insurance scheme would now be directly implemented by the state government.

Lucknow,Glamour &amp; limelight is an industry where demands from an individual are very high: Aditi Govitrikar,"Actress Aditi Govitrikar of 'De Dana Dan' fame was in the city, recently for a personal engagement. The '16 December' actress, who has been to the city several times before, in a candid chat with us shares what she loves about Lucknow, about her long hiatus in Bollywood, her personal life, upcoming projects and more. The actress and model Aditi, who ventured into acting through a Telegu movie, Thammudu in 1999, has been away from mainstream cinema for quite a long time. Ask the model turned actress the reason for such a long hiatus as far as her Bollywood career is concerned and she says that she hasn't been entirely missing from the silver screen. ""I worked in a movie in 2016 which was to release at the end of 2017, but the project got shelved due to roadblocks in the producer’s way. As for movies this year, I was a part of this spectacular Marathi movie called Smile Please directed by Vikram Phadnis. As far as Bollywood is concerned, I’m also playing a part in Amin Hajee’s next, titled Koi Jaane Na which is set to release early next year."" Aditi has also done quite a lot of TV shows and serials like Bigg Boss, Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi and was last seen in the show Suryaputra Karn in 2015. ""Until last year I was quite preoccupied with my degrees. Fortunately, this year Harvard has graced us with flexible learning schedules, so I could take up more work on-screen,"" says Aditi, who is currently pursuing a Masters in Psychology from Harvard University.

""It never does and it never will. I follow a simple funda – be a lifelong learner. That’s what motivates me to better myself with every chance I get, and I also add more value to people I meet and work with. I want to remain active and exercise my grey cells for as long as I can,"" she replies with a smile. So, it must be difficult for her to manage studies, professional life, and personal life at the same time to which the Bheja Fry 2 actress admits, ""It gets hectic at times honestly, but as long as it’s something I love doing, I find a way. My friends and family know I love studying, but there’s absolutely no way I wouldn’t give up my time for friends and family. So, it somehow just always works out."" She has been creating awareness about mental health and has been counselling people to deal with mental illness. Ask Aditi what kind of depression and mental illness celebrities go through and she says, ""Every industry comes with their own levels of challenges. Glamour and limelight is yet another such industry where demands from an individual are very high. Some common causes of depression I see are - lack of real personal connections and time outside work, performance pressure, then forcing oneself to look or be perfect all the time has its own drawbacks and pressure."" Talking about her upcoming movie 'Koi Jane Na', which is being directed by Amin Hajee and is slated to release next year, Aditi is excited not only about the movie but also about the recreation of a famous old song from the movie 'Mr India', 'Zindagi Ki Yehi Reet Hai Haar Ke Baad Hi Jeet Hai', which she is a part of. Sharing her feeling on how it was to recreate such an iconic song, she says, ""It was amazing. The way an entire story is portrayed in such a short frame of time, is simply fabulous! Plus, it’s a song with such profound lyrics, it’s always been a reminder to me that failures are not the end but stepping stones to something bigger and better. There are times, even today when I listen to this song for inspiration."" Having been to Lucknow many times before, she has fond memories of her visits here. ""I have been to Lucknow before and have been to Imambada, Shahi Baoli, the main Chowk market and other popular places in old Lucknow. I love shopping in Hazratganj for Chikan work.

The innovation dialogue will take place after the formal delegation talks at Hyderabad House between the two governments on Monday morning. Political discussions between India and Sweden may be strained however, particularly after the Swedish foreign minister issued sharp criticism of India's Kashmir policy in their parliament earlier this week. On Wednesday, the Swedish foreign minister Ann Linde told the country's parliament, Riksdag, that ""Sweden and the EU support a bilateral political solution through contacts between India and Pakistan. We emphasise the importance of respect for human rights, that an escalation of the situation in Kashmir is avoided and that a long-term political solution to the situation must involve Kashmir's inhabitants. Dialogue between India and Pakistan is crucial. Sweden and the EU urge the Indian government to lift the remaining restrictions imposed on Jammu and Kashmir.

Lucknow,"Swine flu: No isolation beds, separate queues in hospitals","LUCKNOW: The H1N1 virus has already infected 550 people in the city and claimed seven lives, but three major government-aided hospitals here are doing precious little to prevent the swine flu scourge.

A TOI reality check on Friday exposed how blatantly safety protocol and guidelines of the World Health Organisation are being violated at a time the seasonal intensity of the disease is expected to increase. According to WHO, every hospital should have separate registration counters for suspected swine flu patients and isolation wards for confirmed H1N1 cases.

Doctors said a patient was sent to the isolation wards after swine flu confirmation. However, since test results take two days to arrive, it leaves enough scope for other patients in the casualty ward to be infected. Chief medical superintendent of KGMU professor SN Shankhwar said signs and awareness posters would be installed in a week across the campus. “All suspected cases will be directly transferred to isolation wards,” he added.

Fast food joints and restaurants have also reduced the quantity of onion in salads. Some have started charging for the item, which earlier used to be complementary. “We now charge Rs 10 per plate of salad which was earlier free,” said the owner of a famous restaurant in Lalbagh. Even the menu of wedding parties has been altered with more onion-free preparations on the list. Of the five weddings that a city caterer has hosted this week, onion was not served in salad or main course in three. “Onion is priced at Rs 7,000 per quintal. Most organisers are not prepared for this kind of expenditure,” said Amit Srivastava, a caterer. The relentless rise in prices of onion started in September when crops in Maharashtra and Karnataka—the main producers—got damaged due to excessive rain. From Rs 10-15 per kg in July to Rs 80-90 per kg in September, the price of onion fell slightly in October to Rs 50-60 per kg.

However, prices could drop after a fortnight by Rs 40-50 per kg as fresh supply is expected by December 15. “Onion prices during this time of the year are generally Rs 20-30 per kg. This year, they have gone up by three-five times. Besides damages due to floods, the increase in demand due to the ongoing wedding season is the prime reason for the hike at present. We expect fresh crop to arrive in 2-3 weeks. That should bring down the prices by about 50%,” said Raju, a wholesaler at the Sitapur Road Mandi, the largest in the city. "
Lucknow,‘IS sympathiser shot in UP radicalised on Telegram’,"LUCKNOW: With Facebook-owned WhatsApp embroiled in a cyber-espionage row, another end-to-end encrypted messaging platform, Telegram, has gained currency. But this lesser-known app is more vulnerable to security breach after police stumbled upon Telegram messages of a suspected ISIS sympathizer, who was killed in a police encounter in Lucknow in March. “Suspected ISIS sympathiser Mohammed Saiful killed during a siege in Haji Ali Colony in Thakurganj was radicalised on Telegram. He was very active on this messaging service,” said former ATS ADG Asim Arun, who led the commando operation in the state capital. Arun, who is now ADG Technical Services, was speaking to TOI on sidelines of the 47th All India Police Science Congress (AIPSC) organised in Lucknow, where a special session on social media and radicalisation was held with top officials from different security wings. With social media playing an active role in radicalisation of young minds, another top police official said: “At least 53 youths from UP were radicalised on social media platforms. Of this, 17 have been de-radicalised and others critically analysed.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Earlier, Kalraj Mahesh Kumar, DIG, Ernakulam range in Kerala, said: “Telegram was launched in Russia in 2013 and subsequently banned in 2018. Indonesia was quick to follow. Then why can't Indian police agencies impose intermediary liabilities against social media platforms? This is due to misinterpretation of Section 79(3) of IT Act.” “Under this section, an intermediary is duty-bound to remove or block content on instructions from authorities. Since Telegram has no nodal office in India unlike Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and WhatsApp, it's impossible for police to enforce intermediary liability against it. There’s no law in India that enables police to bypass encryption.” Germany, US and EU enforced strict laws which forces these social media platforms to target and take down materials that propagate, spread terror content and ideologies. “India also needs to look forward to new frameworks that adopt similar set of regulations,” he said.

Lucknow,‘$5 trillion economy impossible sans strong law &amp; order’,"LUCKNOW: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said that the country’s economy could not achieve the $5-trillion dream till a strong law and order situation is in place. Speaking at the 47th All India Police Science Congress in Lucknow on Friday, Shah said that India had massive cultural diversity but high vulnerability, which could be checked with better policing. “I am confident that we can become a $5-trillion economy. But the Centre cannot do it alone. Every state needs to contribute towards it,” Shah said.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Child rape cases rose 20% in 5 years, most in rural areas","GHAZIABAD: Cases of child rape have seen over 20% rise in Ghaziabad district over the past five years. According to data sourced from the police, as many as 116 cases of rape were reported in 2015 and the figure rose to 152 in 2018. Between January and September this year, 141 cases of rape against minors have already been registered in Ghaziabad district. Police pointed out that the increase in numbers also suggested that more and more people were coming out in open to report rape cases, battling the social stigma attached to it and reposing faith in the cops.  What’s more interesting is that 60-65% of Pocso cases have been filed by the residents of rural areas and those from urban areas account for the remaining part. Around 30% of the cases have been registered against neighbours while 27% against friends and relatives. According to the officials, the only Pocso court in Ghaziabad has as many as 1,477 such cases pending. Police said that cases under the Pocso Act — which defines a child as any person below 18 years of age and is gender-neutral — are regularly monitored by a special cell and investigation is given precedence.

In total, 632 cases have reached the court between 2017 and 2018, and 58 of them have resulted in acquittals. Between January and July this year, 226 cases were brought before the Pocso court and eight of nine cases decided so far have ended in acquittals. Asked about the rise in numbers, SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said that people are becoming more aware and coming out to file complaints, instead of reaching a compromise. “The number of Pocso cases is higher in rural areas because the village population is more than that in urban areas,” he said. “Police are also helping people become more aware. They are holding various programmes with help from NGOs in the district. Nukkad natak and door-to-door campaigns are being organised across the district. The police have even asked the schools to educate students about the crime,” added the SP (rural). According to the police officer, in most cases, the accused are either relatives or someone known to the survivor. In such cases, there is a high chance that the two parties might reach a compromise. Varun Pathak, a human rights activist in Delhi, said the rate of rapes against minors is increasing because in most cases, the accused are uneducated and poor. “Porn sites also play a major role in the crime,” he said.

The meeting was convened to review development of Kashi, but the agenda was Ayodhya. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also attended the key meeting with senior government officers and there was a unanimity that Ayodhya would be transformed into a top religious destination for Hindus from across the world with worldclass infrastructure, hospitality services, renovated mutts and mandirs that would draw more pilgrims than Mecca or Vatican. PwC, which recommended a complete revamp of infrastructure, logistics, services and ambience of the existing town, also stated that once the Ram temple is constructed, the footfalls is expected to spiral to around 2 crore annually and could outpace pilgrim count at Amritsar’s Golden Temple, which clocks 1.2 crore devotees annually.
