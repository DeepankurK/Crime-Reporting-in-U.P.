Lucknow,Residents to fete brave for riding on Gaddha Shri,"LUCKNOW: Fed up with potholes around their homes, residents of Jankipuram Extension will take to Gandhigiri to draw the attention of authorities on the eve of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Along with a candle march, residents will mock potholes by ‘honouring’ them with titles such as ‘gaddha shri’, ‘gaddha bhushan’.

Complaints to LDA and LMC have fallen on deaf ears.” Chief engineer of LDA Indu Shekhar Singh said, “Most of Jankipuram Extension was handed to LMC a few months ago. It’s their responsibility to repair the stretch.” “Civic work in Jankipuram Extension came under LMC last month. Earlier, panchayats and LDA were responsible it.

Lucknow,Potholed roads are virtual death traps across Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: Incidents like the one on Saturday when a man was killed because of bad roads can happen in other parts of the city too. The 32-year-old was crushed under the wheels of a truck after his two-wheeler hit a pothole. A quick survey by TOI found several roads ridden with potholes and gravel following rainfall in almost all localities of the city, posing threat to human life. Times ViewLMC must react before another life is lost or anyone suffers injury due to broken roads. If roads can only be repaired after rainy season, the civic body can at least find a way to level potholes and get loose gravel removed from the roads. LMC must also consider adopting new technology to build roads that can survive rains. An inquiry should also be done to find out if quality was compromised because some of the roads now in bad shape were constructed just before the start of monsoon. As per norms, a newly constructed road should last for five years.From Thakurganj, Mahanagar, Jankipuram, Nishatganj to Narhi, Aashiana, Gomtinagar, Indiranagar and Chinhat—everywhere people complained that gravel and potholes cause minor accidents daily, leaving people with fractures and injuries. Any such accident can be fatal if roads are not repaired immediately, they said. Vineet Saraswat of Thakurganj said, “A biker’s accident took place in front of my eyes. He lost control while dodging a big pothole and fell. He was injured.” In Mahanagar, roads repaired before monsoon already have craters giving bumpy rides to motorists. Shikhar Chaturvedi, a commuter, said, “The whole stretch was laid barely months ago but is worn out again. I wonder what kind of construction material these people use.” Arsalan Abassi of Jankipuram said, “We have lodged several complains with LMC but nothing has been done. I have to drive extremely carefully so that I don’t end up in a ditch.” In Aashiana, Vikram Singh said, “Roads in our locality were repaired in March but could not bear rainfall and have been damaged badly. LMC chief engineer SP Pal said, “We are repairing roads in one zone at a time. We will be able to repair and re-construct all roads after monsoon ends.” "

Lucknow,"Samajwadi Party doors open, but Shivpal Yadav sets riders to return home","LUCKNOW: The estranged member of the Yadav family of UP and the national president of the PSP (Progressive Socialist Party Lohia) Shivpal Yadav may have offered to return to the party fold but is not in a hurry and has certain terms and conditions. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav's recent declaration that the doors of his party were open for anyone, any time, has triggered off a fresh bout of speculations around the return of Shivpal Yadav to the family and the party. Shivpal had rebelled against the SP leadership in March this year, fielded candidates in the general elections against it and campaigned against the Samajwadi Party candidates, barring a few places. In the general elections earlier this year, both "" bhatija"" (Akhilesh Yadav) and "" chacha"" (Shivpal Yadav) fought against each other under the banners of their political parties and registered. Both fared poorly in the hustings against the BJP. With the state heading towards the 2022 assembly elections and no political party confident enough to take on a belligerent BJP, it was speculated that the defeat of the two prominent family members of the Yadav clan, now in warring camps, would force them to reconsider their future plans. It was in this regard when a question regarding the possibility of return of Shivpal to the SP was put to Akhilesh at a recent press conference, his reply that his doors were open for any one any time, gave ground to the debate. However, Shivpal who laments that he has been humiliated enough in the past, would tread very cautiously and unless he feels his stature is protected and restored and his cadres and rank and file are given their due place in the SP, there is no taking any such decision in a hurry. The president of the fledgling PSP feels that in the eight months of his party's existence, it has contested general elections in eight states, built up organisation in almost all district units and groomed candidates in all 80 parliamentary constituencies and organised major demonstrations and protests against the BJP governments in Lucknow and Delhi. ""Why shall I not focus on my organisation, cadres and consolidate it further till 2022 and shape up the PSPL into a formidable force?"" asks Shivpal Yadav, who said that he was not in a hurry to take any such decision of accepting the offer of returning to the SP. The reiteration of the Samajwadi Party before the speaker of the state assembly Hriday Narain Dikshit for disqualification of his membership compels Shivpal to think that the offer for his return was not serious. Before the talks of return or the merger of his party into the SP, he wants details including protection to his cadres who have stood by him in recent past, rank and file and the names of the candidates for the 2022 assembly elections be finalized.

Vartika, who plans to continue modelling while catering to her NGO, further added, ""My NGO is formally registered and we are now working on the website and team development while this is happening. We will be inviting volunteers from across the country because this is a digital age and people could be working from far off to contribute to this. Identifying local issues with the help of volunteers and helping facilitate the services to make things happen in that area is going to be the goal. Hopefully, this becomes pan India very soon."" The Lucknow girl said that although she is nervous going for the Miss Universe contest, but since she had participated in Miss India, she knows the drill. ""I have already been given my diet chart, workout schedule, and other aspects of training needed for the Miss Universe contest."" Adding further she said, ""I feel that for winning a pageant you just don’t necessarily need to be the most beautiful person on the planet or have the most amazing body, you also have to be a true representative of a woman with strong opinions, who is progressive and has the courage to not only stand up for herself but for others and for the causes she believes in as well. I also feel that the harder you work, the luckier you get."" As Vartika eyes the international crown, she spoke about what makes her different from other candidates competing with her at the Miss Universe pageant and the Lucknow girl said, ""Every contestant is unique and they come with their own set of USPs. I’m the kind of person who has the ability to pick up really fast and I’m very hard working. I’m not blessed with amazing speaking skills or anything but the fact that I can share what’s on my mind and the fact that I can take a stand actually gives me that edge and I believe that could help me win the pageant."" Speaking about a former Miss Universe she admires, Vartika said, ""The Miss Universe I admire the most is Lara Dutta. My closest interaction has been with her. Whenever I see her speak or the way she conducts herself, I am awestruck. I keep wondering if this woman is for real. She’s so elegant and I think she’s phenomenal."" — with inputs by Yashi Agarwal "
Lucknow,UP mining scam: CBI books two IAS officers,"LUCKNOW: CBI on Tuesday lodged a case against two IAS officers and 10 contractors in the mining scam, taking the FIR count to six since the court directed the agency to probe irregularities in the last lap of the Akhilesh Yadav government.

The two IAS have been accused of entering into a criminal conspiracy with the contractors to grant leases. Investigations revealed the scam in Saharanpur began after May 2011 when then district magistrate Chob Singh Verma refused renewal of 13 sand mining leases, citing lack of environmental clearance.

Lucknow,Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to join Congress peace march on Gandhi Jayanti,"LUCKNOW: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will reach Lucknow on Wednesday to launch a padyatra on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, in what could escalate the stand-off between ruling BJP and Congress over the Shahjahanpur rape case.

Sources said, the district administration has put riders for holding the padyatra. “We wanted to sing bhajans, but the administration banned any congregation at GPO Park.

At other times, he wore black rubber slippers. These were for and after his baths at Ferangi Mahal,"" said Adnan, who has been preserving original letters, records and photographs of Gandhi and Bari at Ferangi Mahal. In the words of Gandhi himself, during his stay at the Maulana's house, special arrangements for a Brahman cook were made by Bari whom the Mahatma referred to as his brother. Gandhi had a room to himself during all his stays in Lucknow. ""He would bring his goat along. The goat was tied to a peg under the papaya tree outside his room. The tree is not the same any more, but we have maintained the room. It is not used for other purposes than reliving Gandhiji's memories,"" Adnan said. A number of meetings, secret and public, were held at Ferangi Mahal by the Maulana and the Mahatma for the dual cause of Khilafat and non-cooperation.  The friendship between the Maulana and the Mahatma has transcended time. Today, Adnan is in touch with Gandhi's great grandson Tushar Gandhi. They have met several times.

""Police will also verify the authenticity of documents produced by them who might have acquired Aadhaar, driving licence, voter ID and even gun licence. Officers involved in this drive will also be required to trace middlemen who got these documents made for foreign nationals,” Singh said. "

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: 3-year-old drowns in drain left open after cleaning,"GHAZIABAD: A three-year-old girl died allegedly after falling into an open drain outside her house in Sahibabad on Tuesday. Residents said a concrete slab to cover the drain had been removed 15-20 days ago for cleaning, but the civic agency had not bothered to put it back. Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation has ordered a probe into the alleged negligence. Police said the girl, Ananya, was playing with her two brothers and other children from the neighbourhood while her parents had gone out for some work. The girl’s father works as a daily-wage labourer in a private company in Sahibabad. Around 11am, Ananya’s father Anil Kumar came back home and started looking for his daughter. After an intense search of more than three hours, the body was fished out of the drain. Residents said the concrete slab on the drain had been damaged by GMC workers during the cleaning, and even if the locals wanted to put it back, they could not. Anil said when he came back home, he found his two sons — Siddhi (11) and Aryan (6) — playing outside, but could not find Ananya. The two brothers who were playing with Ananya also could not say much about her whereabouts. “My two sons were playing outside with other children of the neighbourhood, but Ananya was nowhere to be found. When I enquired about her, they told me she was playing with them a few minutes earlier, but they hadn’t seen her since,” he said. The family members informed police and started a search for the girl. After three hours, a neighbour spotted a portion of the body protruding out of the muck in the drain. Ananya was pulled out and rushed to the government hospital. She was declared dead on arrival. Ananya’s family refused to get an autopsy done, but accused GMC for the girl’s death. They said the concrete slab on the drain had been removed 15-20 days ago for cleaning and damaged. It had not been replaced since. “The nagar nigam workers left the spot after cleaning the drain and never came back to cover it or replace the damaged slab,” said a relative. GMC commissioner Dinesh Chandra said the width of the drain is 2ft and it 3ft deep. “The slab may have been removed from cleaning, but the girl’s family should have been a little more careful. I will form a team soon to investigate the matter and a report will be submitted within three working days,” he said. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said police were open to probing the accident and would register an FIR if the family lodged a complaint. A 15-year-old boy died on Saturday after he slipped into an uncovered drain while riding his bicycle in Ghaziabad on July 21. "
Ghaziabad,Delhi-based realtors held in Ghaziabad over Rs 148 crore dues,"GHAZIABAD: An Uttar Pradesh revenue department team on Monday took Sanjeev J Aeren and Rakesh Kumar, owners of Celebration City Projects Private Ltd, into custody for their alleged failure to clear Rs 147.59 crore in dues they owe to the Ghaziabad Development Authority. The Ghaziabad administration claimed the recovery certificate issued against the company was the biggest in the state. Both Aeren and Kumar are residents of Delhi: Aeren lives in Vasant Kunj and Kumar at Green Park. The arrests were made by a team of revenue officials led by sub-divisional magistrate Aditya K Prajapati, who said the duo was apprehended when they had come to Ghaziabad to meet someone. “We got the information about their presence and took them into custody. They have been kept in (Sadar) tehsil lockup for 14 days. If they make a commitment to pay up a decent amount, they could be released,” Prajapati said. Prajapati added that the duo could be handed over to police after 14 days if investors lodge complaints against them at the tehsil office. Officials said despite several notices and the recovery certificate being issued around three years ago, the duo had failed to clear the dues. A partial payment had been made by the company in 2017, after Red Mall was sealed, the officials said, but the dues reached Rs 147.59 crore due to interest accumulated. GDA secretary Santosh Kumar Rai said the owners got instalments rescheduled a few times in the past but failed to fulfil the commitment each time. The developers built Red Mall near New Bus Stand. The firm was allotted commercial land in 2006, and the owners had taken possession of land by paying a percentage of the cost. However, they later failed to pay the remaining amount despite several notices. "
Ghaziabad,Raj Nagar Extension flyover ready but wait for inauguration,"GHAZIABAD: The Meerut to Ghaziabad side of the Raj Nagar Extension flyover is ready but may be opened for traffic only around October 15. The Uttar Pradesh Bridge Corporation has completed work on the stretch and the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has sought time from Ghaziabad MP and Union MoS for road, transport and highways Gen VK Singh (retd) for the formal inauguration of the flyover. This will be the one half of the Raj Nagar Extension flyover while the other half (Ghaziabad to Meerut) was thrown open for public in June this year. Delhi-bound local and inter-state traffic currently use a narrow stretch beneath the flyover, which funnels at the RNE roundabout creating long traffic snarls. However, with the opening of entire stretch, the vehicular movement will ease. “We have been apprised by the UP Bridge Corporation that work one the Meerut-Ghaziabad side of RNE flyover has been completed and is ready to open,” said Kanchan Verma, vice chairperson, GDA. “Since the other half of the flyover was opened for public earlier this year, the whole package will now be inaugurated and for that we have sought time from V K Singh. We hope that by October 15, it will be done,” added Verma. “The 586-metre long and 11-metre wide carriageway on the RNE flyover has three lanes, which will provide seamless vehicular movement for heavy traffic to Delhi from Meerut via Ghaziabad,” said Ajay Singh, project manager, UP Bridge Corporation. “In June this year, we had opened the Ghaziabad-Meerut section, which has the same dimensions. With the opening of this section, the entire RNE flyover will be accessible to public now,” added Singh. “The flyover is constructed based on a ‘bifurcated design’. This means that there is no central verge and each half of the flyover is separated by a distance of 7.5 metres,” said Singh. “The alteration in design was necessitated to accommodate RRTS alignment, which will pass on an elevated platform along the 7.5-metre road below,” said Singh. The flyover falls in one of the busiest section in Ghaziabad that witnesses heavy traffic passes during all times of the day. It was a challenge for the corporation to finish as they got little window to carry out the work. “In January last year we had started work on Vasundhara and RNE flyovers almost simultaneously, but due to the peculiar design of the RNE flyover and the traffic, the project got a bit delayed,” said Singh. “Traffic coming from Raj Nagar Extension side and from Hapur Road side met traffic coming from both sides on Delhi-Meerut road at Raj Nagar roundabout. Since the volume of traffic at any given point of time was so large, it lead to long snarls and it took about half an hour to get past the roundabout,” said Singh. "

Kanpur,Gandhiji gave 'Swachh Bharat' call in Kanpur,"KANPUR: Cleanliness is godliness! This is what Mahatma Gandhi forcefully advocated whenever he visited the city. Being the torchbearer of sanitation, he used to speak in length about the importance of cleanliness in human life and its connection with the spiritual growth. Gandhi also has a strong connection with the historic Tilak Hall in the city's heart -- Meston Road. The iconic building was inaugurated by him on July 24, 1934. Its foundation was laid by former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru in 1931. The building was the head office of the Congress party, where its members used to conduct 'Sarvadharam Prathna' and chant 'Ramdhun'. The hall was constructed in memory of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who also had a special connect with Kanpur. Tilak had many followers in Kanpur and frequently visited the city. After Tilak breathed his last in 1920, his supporters decided to construct a monument in his memory. Ironically, this building was lying neglected since past three decades. But Tilak Hall got back its sheen back in 2013 after renovation. Last time, this building was renovated in 1982. Congress leader Rizwan Hamid said that that several lakhs were spent in the renovation in 2013. Continuous work for 14 months changed the look of the hall which has been the repository of Congress in the city. ""After the establishment of Tilak Hall in 1934, it has been renovated several times but maximum funds were used in 2013. Contractor did not charge anything for the work then,"" Hamid added. "

Lucknow,Congress MLA from Sonia’s turf breaks opposition ranks,"LUCKNOW: Breaking ranks with the opposition, which boycotted the special 36-hour non-stop session of the UP assembly, the Congress MLA from Sonia Gandhi’s parliamentary constituency Rae Bareli not only joined the session on Wednesday, the first day, but also spoke to thunderous applause from the treasury benches. The opposition Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress had decided to stay away from the special session called by CM Yogi Adityanath to discuss development issues under the 16-point charter of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Barring Aditi Singh, Congress MLA from Rae Bareli Sadar assembly constituency, the opposition succeeded in keeping its flock together. Singh was in the news earlier with her praise of Yogi, triggering speculation that she may defect to BJP. Singh, however, has denied any such move. With the treasury benches cheering her, Singh began her speech at the assembly on Wednesday by praising Yogi. She said she was thankful to the CM for promising to change the format of panchayat elections from the existing indirect elections to direct polls. Singh said she decided to join the special session as it has been called as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, which inspired her to rise above party lines to pay tribute to Gandhi. The Congress high command had recently elevated Singh to Mahila Congress all-India general secretary, projecting her as a future leader, and also nominated her as the all-India in-charge of the Priyadarshini project to connect with women and young girls. Singh sat along with Independent MLA Amanmani Tripathi in the assembly. Showering praise on Yogi, Singh said under the BJP government houses were being allotted to the poor in an impartial manner while in the past this used to be riddled with caste considerations. She said she has risen above party lines whenever she felt she should do so for nation-building. It was for this reason that she supported the Centre on stripping Jammu &amp; Kashmir of the special status granted to it by Article 370. "
Lucknow,UP: Not meddling in personal matters but can’t let minor marry,"NEW DELHI: The UP government has told the Supreme Court that it has no intention to interfere in personal matters like marriage in religious communities, be they minority or majority groups, but affirmed it is duty-bound to take action to prevent a minor girl from getting married. In the light of an allegation levelled by an alleged minor Muslim girl that she was being harassed by police due to her marriage to a Muslim man, a bench headed by Justice N V Ramana had asked the UP home secretary to be personally present in court on September 23. The girl had stated that she had voluntarily married Javaid Ahmad and sought validation of the marriage on the ground that even if minor, her marriage is valid under the Islamic law as she has attained puberty. Acting on a kidnapping complaint by her father, police produced her before a Bahraich judicial magistrate, who sent her to a women’s shelter. However, the Allahabad HC’s Lucknow bench ordered her to be lodged in a children’s home as a minor could not be kept at a shelter for adult women. The girl moved SC against the order. When the SC took up the case and the state did not file response to her petition despite two opportunities, the bench summoned the state home secretary. SC’s tough stand forced the government to urgently file a response through standing counsel Parmanand Pandey and the home secretary too appeared before the bench. The state in its affidavit said, “Her school leaving certificate says that she was 15 years and two months. The medical report says she is of 16 years. Nikahnama says she was 18 and in her statement before a magistrate, she claimed to be of 20 years. This is the reason why police swung into action (on the kidnapping complaint).” "

While most of his colleagues showed signs of fatigue once in a while, the CM appeared to be alert, nodding along while hearing speeches and laughing at jokes. Members had been assigned topics and most of them referred to copiously written notes while making speeches. By midnight, the session was running delayed by at least six hours and Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit had to force members to cut short their speeches. When members wouldn’t listen, others started banging on desks to drown out their words. First-time MLA, Manju Tyagi, representing Srinagar constituency from Lakhimpur, had the House in splits shortly after midnight when she continued praising the CM and apologising “for any inadvertent mistakes” being a first-time member, even as she shot past her allocated time. Sunita Singh, MLA from Ghazipur, took the mike soon after Tyagi and regaled the House with her couplets, especially one targeting Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan. While members of both Houses kept taking frequent breaks to stretch their limbs and tide over stress and fatigue, the assembly staff was not as lucky. Along the main driveway inside the assembly premises, music emanated from almost every vehicle where drivers and assistants tried to stay awake by watching films on phones or listening to radio while swatting mosquitoes. Inside the building, tired security and administration staff waited listlessly at their assigned positions having been on duty since morning. The canteen staff, which served a few hundred MLAs, MLCs, guests and other staff, managed to clean up by 1am, and immediately plunged into preparations for breakfast. “We are helpless. As long as the session is on, we will not get a break. And because of the nature of our job, we cannot afford to let up for even a minute,” said a security personnel on duty. "
Lucknow,Sonia Gandhi’s dig at BJP: Easy to take Gandhi’s name but difficult to follow in his footsteps,"NEW DELHI: In a sharp take down of the ruling BJP and its ideological parent RSS, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that those who are thirsty for power, who consider themselves supreme, and who indulge in the politics of falsehood will never understand Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals of truth, Swaraj and selfless service. Sonia Gandhi was speaking at the culmination of Delhi Congress’ Gandhi Yatra at Rajghat. Congress also led Gandhi yatras across the country, with party MP Rahul Gandhi participating in the Delhi march, and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra leading the charge in Lucknow. Battling the BJP as it attempts to appropriate Mahatma Gandhi as its own, Sonia told party workers and leaders at Rajghat that Gandhi’s soul would be pained to see how the India of his dreams had changed in the last five years. “It is easy to take Gandhi’s name but difficult to follow in his footsteps,” Sonia said, adding that India and Gandhi are synonymous. “They want RSS, not Gandhi to be the icon of India. But an inclusive India, built on the politics of truth, is the hallmark of Gandhi’s legacy. Those who gain power unscrupulously, and who consider themselves supreme, will not understand Gandhi Swarajya, or his selfless service to the nation,” she said, accusing the BJP and RSS of using “every imaginable trick” to shake the foundations of the India that Bapu built, but failing to upset India’s composite culture and civilisation. “Picchhle chaar-paanch saalon mein, saam, daam, dand, bhed ka khula karobaar karke ve apne aap ko bahut taakatvar samajhte hain. Is sabke bavajood agar bharat nahin bhatka, to isliye ki humare mulk ki buniyaad mein Gandhi ji ke usoolon ki adhaarshila hai. (In recent years, they have been unscrupulous and used every trick in the trade to become powerful. But India did not lose its way because it is founded on the principles laid by Mahatma Gandhi),” Sonia Gandhi said. In Lucknow, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the BJP should pursue the path of truth before talking about Gandhi. She made the remarks before participating in a silent three-kilometre march that culminated in the Congress leaders offering floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi. On Wednesday, Congress leaders, including Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, also paid tributes to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri at his memorial in Vijay Ghat. "
Lucknow,"'Switch to khadi, shun plastic as tribute to Bapu': Yogi Adityanath","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath urged people to switch to khadi and shun single-use plastic for preserving the environment as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary on Wednesday. ""Swachhta was closely linked to the ideals of swaraj and swadeshi, which Mahatma Gandhi upheld to get freedom from British rule,"" CM Yogi said while paying tributes. ""Gandhiji believed in swachhta as a way of life. He said if a person is not healthy, then that person could not be expected to contribute in any way. Therefore, the swachhta mission is so important,"" he said, while inaugurating an 11-day khadi exhibition in Lucknow. ""We must follow these ideals and switch to non-plastic alternatives if we want India to become economic superpower,"" he said.  ""Several cows which stopped giving milk were found to have ingested several kilos of plastic. Stop committing the sin of killing cows and go plastic-free. It has one use but so many negative impacts,"" he said. ""Khadi gave a fillip to our freedom struggle. Till the country fought with weapons, it did not get success. We got freedom when khadi spread from cities to villages. We are now giving solar and electric charkhas to provide employment to youth,"" he said. CM said 20 lakh jobs have been created since BJP came to power in UP and brought investments of about Rs 2 lakh crore. He said that 25 lakh more jobs would be created in MSMEs in next two-and-a half-years. MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh, who is grandson of ex-PM Lal Bahadur Shastri, recalled an anecdote about his family's association with khadi. ""At the time of my grandparents' marriage, when my grandfather was asked what would he like in dowry, he asked for a charkha. I still have that charkha and seeing it gives me pride and encouragement,"" he said. The government has signed an MoU with e-commerce website and khadi products will now be available on Flipkart and Amazon. "
Lucknow,"Gorakhpur child deaths: Two years after derogatory remark, Paresh Rawal apologises to Dr Kafeel Khan","LUCKNOW: Two years after a derogatory remark against suspended pediatrician of Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical College Dr Kafeel Khan, actor Paresh Rawal apologised to him on twitter on Wednesday. Rawal had called Kafeel a “hero in the eyes of the ever active termite clan” in a tweet which had hailed him as a hero soon after the medical college tragedy that led to the death of almost 60 children due to lack of oxygen supply in August 2017. Kafeel was recently absolved of key charges related to the tragedy in a departmental inquiry. Rawal, who was the MP from Ahmedabad east constituency till 2019 Lok Sabha elections, had made the comment in August 2017 soon after the incident. On Tuesday, Kafeel, referring to Rawal’s tweet of 2017, demanded an apology from him, saying he had not expected the actor to be “closed-minded &amp; obstinate”. He also said he had looked up to the actor as a fan for years. “You have not just called me a termite but all Indians termites. This was unexpected of you as we are fans of yours. I demand an apology from you,” Kafeel had said on his social media account. The BJP leader then tendered an apology on Wednesday saying, “There is no shame in apologising when one is wrong...I apologise to Dr Kafeel Khan.” Reacting to it, Kafeel replied that while he was appreciative of Rawal’s apology, “we should also be sorry to the 70 parents who lost their kids in the BRD oxygen tragedy.” The inquiry report in the oxygen supply incident submitted to the medical education department in April this year did not find Kafeel guilty of medical negligence and corruption. It also said that he was not the in charge of the encephalitis ward where the tragedy had struck. Kafeel was, however, found guilty of private practice till April 2017. "

Sambhal SP, Yamuna Prasad, told TOI, “NSA was invoked against one Bantu. Video footage showed Bantu was involved in the attack by a mob of 29 persons on two brothers, Raju and Ramavtar, while they were taking their nephew Ravi to hospital in Chandausi on August 28. Raju died on the way to hospital. “We arrested 19 persons, while warrant was issued against 11 others,” said Prasad. ADG (law &amp; order) PV Ramashastry told TOI, “Investigation is still on in many cases, while chargesheet has been filed in Sambhal incident. Police action has curbed rumours and mob attacks in the state in last 15 days.” “The district police was asked to identify hotspots and then asked PRVs to conduct patrolling. Police stations having jurisdiction of hospitals, bus stops were asked to remain extra vigilant,” said Ramashastry. IG (law &amp; order) Praveen Kumar said, “We created a mechanism to check rumour mongering at two-levels. In rural areas, SHOs were directed to make WhatsApp groups and add gram pradhans and teachers, and telling them to alert police in case of any such incident. The COs were told to spread awareness. In urban areas, digital volunteers are keeping a close watch on every rumour on social media and WhatsApp groups.” He said cases of non-cognisable offences were lodged against those spreading child-lifting rumours on social media sites.

Lucknow,UP: 150 little Gandhis march for peace &amp; power of love,"LUCKNOW: Sporting a spotless white dhoti and angvastra, a bamboo staff in one hand and a pair of round glasses resting on his nose, four-year-old Ansh was an overdose of cuteness as he shouted ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ amid the cacophony of a busy Hazratganj. The little boy was among 150 schoolchildren — aged between four and 16 years — who dressed as Mahatma Gandhi on Wednesday to pay their respects to the father of the nation on his 150th birth anniversary. Replicating the 1930 Dandi March against the hated salt tax imposed by the British, the students marched for half a kilometre from GPO Park to Vidhan Sabha to honour the iconic leader who was assassinated in 1948. The programme was organised by the state education and culture department. “My teacher said we should thank Gandhiji for fighting for our freedom. Today, there are so many Gandhi lookalikes here, all inspired by his life and struggle,” said Prashant Yadav, a Class IV student. While the spectacular march was led by youngest participant Ansh, Pratapgarh resident Tirthnath Gandhi (69) — who embraced the Mahatma’s way of life in 2007 to fight for rural rights — was a guest participant. A stick in one hand and the Gita in the other, Tirthnath — also a Gandhi lookalike — chanted ‘Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram’ and was a crowd-puller no less. The students carried placards to tell people about Gandhi’s ideas on cleanliness and non-violence, among others. A mini-Kasturba Gandhi also participated in the march and raised slogans for education of the girl child. “Bapu always endorsed empowerment of women and was deeply inspired by his mother Putlibai and wife Kasturba. Though the times have changed, a lot still needs to be done for the country that was envisioned by Gandhi when he fought for our Independence,” said 15-year-old Anchal Ahuja. "
Lucknow,Spinning the golden thread that ties a nation,"LUCKNOW: In a befitting tribute to the Mahatma on his 150th birth anniversary on Wednesday, students and teachers of National Post Graduate College (NPGC) spun cotton threads using the Gandhi charkha, an eternal symbol of self-sufficiency and independence. To mark the special day, the institute installed on campus 10 Yerwada charkhas donated by Gandhi Ashram. Basically portable, hand-cranked wheels for spinning short-staple fibres, the charkha was reinvented by Gandhi during his stay at Pune’s Yerwada jail in the 1940s and that is how it gets its name. “The spinning wheel is not only a symbol of revolution, but one of change. It is the real Make in India campaign,” said BCom student Ankit Singh. “So long, we had only read about the charkha; today, we were fortunate enough to try our hands on it,” he added. The students chorused Gandhi’s favourite bhajan — ‘Vaishnav jan to tene kahiye je, Peed paraayi jaane re (One who is a Vaishnav or devotee of Vishnu, knows the pain of others)’ — to stress on self-reliance and empathy. “Bapu’s charkha marked the path of progress for India’s spinning Industry. It not only made Indians realise the power of Swadeshi goods, but was also the first and the most successful startup idea ,” said BA student Akarshita Jaiswal. Assistant professor of psychology Jagriti Shukla said her first experience at the spinning wheel was enlightening. “Using the charkha reminded me of our freedom struggle. It is a means to be independent,” she said. Principal Nirja Singh said students should not only study about Gandhi’s ideologies, but adopt them in life. “So, we had got the spinning wheels installed almost a week ago. Students received training under instructor Amar Nath Shukla from Gandhi Ashram,” Singh said, adding that the training would continue for another two weeks and a seminar room had been allotted for the purpose.

Lucknow,Lucknow gave up Baqrid cow slaughter in Gandhi’s honour a century ago,"LUCKNOW: One hundred years ago and long before the UP Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955, was envisioned, Muslims in Lucknow voluntarily gave up cow slaughter on Baqrid to crown the friendship between Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Abdul Bari of Ferangi Mahal. The practice kept alive ever since was validated by Sri Dharma Bharat Mahamanandal, established in 1887 by Pt Madan Mohan Malviya, and was written about by Gandhi himself in his letter to the Mumbai edition of The Times of India (TOI) on September 6, 1919. The voluntary abstention from cow slaughter on Baqrid was taken up following Gandhi’s support for the Khilafat movement, which under Bari’s leadership was a burning issue among Indian Muslims. As the Mahatma backed their cause, Bari appealed to Muslims to join the non-cooperation movement in huge numbers and in honour of Hindu-Muslim unity, give up cow slaughter on Eid. “Sharing details of their conversation in the September issue of Mumbai TOI in 1919, Gandhi applauded the step and emphasised that it was an unconditional one from Maulana Bari who enjoyed a massive following across the country,” said the Maulana’s descendant Adnan Abdul Wali Ferangi Mahali. “All Urdu letters written by Gandhi to Bari were signed off as “aapka khadim (your servant)”. Gandhi also referred to him (Bari) as brother,” Adnan added. Read this story in BengaliTrue to his word, according to Gandhi’s letter, the Maulana “started preaching amongst his followers and friends the necessity of abstention from cow-killing”. On September 6, 1919, Gandhi received a telegram from Bari that read, “In celebration of Hindu-Muslim unity, no cow sacrifices in Ferangi Mahal this Baqreid — Abdul Bari”. On January 10, 1920, Malviya’s Sri Dharma Mahamandal thanked Bari in a letter for his “efforts through speech and abstention himself, that in the days of Baqreid there was no cow-killing in Lucknow”.

BJP should follow the path shown by Gandhiji and then talk about him,” she said after offering tributes to Mahatma’s statue at GPO Park in Hazratganj.

Barring Aditi Singh, who is Congress MLA from Rae Bareli Sadar Assembly constituency, the Opposition succeeded in keeping its flock together. ‘My presence a tribute to Bapu’Singh was in the news earlier with her praise of Yogi, triggering speculation that she may defect to BJP. Singh, however, has denied any such move. With the Treasury benches cheering her, Singh began her speech at the Assembly on Wednesday by praising Yogi. Singh said she was thankful to the CM for promising to change the format of panchayat elections from the existing indirect elections to direct polls. Singh said she decided to join the special session as it has been called as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, which inspired her to rise above party lines to pay tribute to Gandhi. The Congress high command had recently elevated Singh to Mahila Congress all-India general secretary, projecting her as a future leader, and also nominated her as the all-India in-charge of the Priyadarshini project to connect with women and young girls. Singh sat along with Independent MLA Amanmani Tripathi in the assembly. Showering praise on Yogi, Singh — a first-time MLA — said under the BJP government houses were being allotted to the poor in an impartial manner while in the past this used to be riddled with caste considerations. She said she has risen above party lines whenever she felt she should do so for nation-building. It was for this reason that she supported the Centre on stripping Jammu &amp; Kashmir of the special status granted to it by Article 370. "

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Told to part ways, couple take poison, walk to SSP’s office","GHAZIABAD: A man and a woman, claiming to be a married couple, reached the SSP office on Thursday and told police that they had consumed rat poison over harassment by a newly-appointed administrative official. The duo claimed that they got married three months back in a local court and the official is forcing them to separate, police said. The couple has been identified as Lalit Chaudhary (31), a resident of Ator village, and Sonia (29), a resident of Hoshiarpur in Punjab. According to them, they had married on July 1 and have a marriage certificate to prove that. They told the cops that they had consumed rat poison by mixing it in soft drinks before reaching the SSP office. The police called a UP 100 PRV and rushed them to a government hospital in Sanjay Nagar for treatment. Their condition is said to be stable. Notably, Lalit had spent 10 days in jail last month after a woman – Damini – claiming to be his first wife filed an FIR against him under IPC sections 494 (marrying again during the lifetime of husband or wife), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) at Sihani gate police station. Damini told TOI she was Muslim by birth and had converted to Hinduism after meeting Lalit in October 2014. Later, she and Lalit got married in December 2016 at an Arya Samaj temple in Haridwar. Damini claimed that they have a two-year-old child.  Lalit denied that he was ever married to Damini. “I had helped her when she approached me with her personal problems. I helped her in getting a rented accommodation. She filed a false complaint against me. I have only been married once and that too with Sonia,” he said. Shlok Kumar, SP (city) said that the police are investigating the matter. When contacted, sub-divisional magistrate (Sadar) Aditya K Prajapati refuted all the allegations. He said that the official in the matter is an under-trainee deputy collector and has nothing to do with the case. “The under-trainee official had referred the matter to a family court where Lalit and Damini were given some counseling. The official had agreed to take her back. He is not at fault,” he added. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad Development Authority names 37 officials in Rs 3 crore land scam,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) on Thursday concluded its investigation in the Swarn Jayanti Puran land allotment scam and sent a chargesheet to the state government naming 37 of its officials, both serving and retired. GDA vice-chairperson Kanchan Verma said, “We have dispatched the chargesheet naming the 37 officials, who were found to be involved in the alleged irregularities committed in restoration of plots in the Swarn Jayanti Puram housing scheme.” Verma added, “The officials include junior engineers, assistant engineers and executive engineers under whose watch the irregularities took place. Many of them may have retired or been promoted. It is now up to the state government to decide on the course of action it wishes to initiate against them.” The investigation relates to the housing scheme that was launched bu GDA in 1998. A total of 1,553 plots (sizes of 200 sqm, 150 sqm, 112 sqm and 90 sqm) were carved out and put up for sale. But 139 allotments were cancelled as the investors defaulted on EMI payments. However, some officials, in connivance with middlemen and property dealers, got the allotments restored between 2005 and 2007 on behalf of the original allottees by asking them to pay a small amount. Later, these officials got the plots transferred in their own names. The catch was that these plots were restored at a sector rate prevailing in 1998 which was between Rs 2,575 per sqm and Rs 2,820 per sqm. As per law, the plots should have been restored to allotees at the sector rate prevailing at that time (2005-2007) or 75% of the market value or whichever was higher. The sector rate between 2005 and 2007 was Rs 12,000 per sqm. A committee report had stated that the scam caused a loss of around Rs 3 crore and an additional Rs 30 lakh in stamp duty to the state exchequer. The scam came to light when GMC councillor Rajender Tyagi filed a petition in the Allahabad high court. The court had then directed Moradabad commissioner R K Singh to probe into the matter. In December 2017, the GDA lodged FIRs against the officials. "
Lucknow,"Humara system ulta hai, says UP man with rare defect","LUCKNOW: It took Jamaluddin Ansari 43 years to know the biggest secret of his anatomy. And its revelation left both Ansari and his doctor in a state of shock. A chance medical examination revealed that all of Ansari’s organs are inversely positioned in his body against their usual position in a human body. “Humara system sab ulta pulta hai (All of my internal system is wrongly placed),” says the 43-year-old government employee from Padrauna, Kushinagar. The human heart is more towards the left side but in Ansari’s case it’s on the right. His liver and gallbladder are on the left side instead of right. Spleen is on the right side and appendix on the left. Doctors say it is a congenital defect, known as Situs Invertus Totalis, where internal organs are inversely placed and appear as mirror image. As per several researches conducted on the subject, the condition was first described by Italian anatomist surgeon Marco Aurelio in 1643. It was by chance that Ansari learnt about his “weird and rare” medical condition. On September 16, Ansari had pain on left side of stomach. He went to a physician in Kushinagar who prescribed an x-ray. “My x-ray result showed I had gallbladder stones. But it also showed that my gallbladder was on the left side instead of right. The doctor referred me to a surgeon for stone removal in Gorakhpur,” said Ansari who is in sugarcane department. This is when Ansari met laparoscopic and bariatric surgeon Dr Shashikant Dixit in Gorakhpur. Explaining the rare condition, Dr Dixit said, “Ansari’s organs are in mirror image of the actual positions for them in a human body. It is a rare condition which makes diagnosis tricky. Such patients are at the risk of a heart condition. But if they suffer a heart attack they will complain of pain on the right side. This leads to confusion and errors in diagnosis if the congenital condition is not known.” “I was shocked initially, but what can one do when there is a birth defect. I read about it and then made peace with it,” said Ansari. “My family members also panicked initially but now they have also come to terms with my condition,” he added. "

Lucknow,UP government orders fresh probe against Kafeel Khan,"LUCKNOW: A fresh inquiry has been ordered by the UP government to probe into allegations of indiscipline, corruption and gross negligence in duty by suspended pediatrician of Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical College Dr Kafeel Khan. In a previous inquiry by a senior IAS officer furnished to the medical education department in April 2019, Kafeel was absolved of two out of four charges levelled against him by the government. A final decision on these charges where Kafeel had been absolved is still to be taken by the government, authorities said. Of the four cases, Kafeel was found guilty of indulging in private practice and being attached to a private nursing home in Gorakhpur till April 2017. On Thursday, addressing a press briefing at the Lok Bhavan, principal secretary medical education department, Rajneesh Dube said that the fresh inquiry will investigate a total of seven charges against Kafeel. Dube will be the inquiry officer to probe these charges. “Dr Kafeel Khan has not been exonerated in the case. He has been spreading misinformation through social media as well as in mainstream media regarding the investigation,” said Dube. “Departmental proceedings in four cases against Kafeel were recommended after he was prima facie found guilty in the incident at BRD Medical College. He was found holding private practice and operating a private nursing home while still in the position of senior resident and regular spokesperson in government service. These two charges are cases of serious corruption and gross violation of rules,” said Dube. Another fresh angle which will now be probed includes an incident from 2018, where Kafeel had tried to treat children at the district hospital in Bharaich. This, along with spreading misleading information in media, will be put under the charge of serious misconduct, in the new inquiry. “During the suspension period, Kafeel attempted to treat patients by forcibly entering the pediatric department of district hospital Bahraich with three four outsiders on September 22, 2018, causing panic in the hospital,” Dube added. In the earlier inquiry report, Kafeel was, however, not found to be the in-charge of AES 100 number ward where the oxygen supply tragedy had struck, taking the life of more than 60 children in August 2017. He was also not found guilty of not informing his seniors of the emergency situation back then nor was he involved in corruption related to tendering process for oxygen cylinders, as per the earlier report which surfaced in the media on September 27.

Lucknow,La Martiniere case: Rahul's fall recreated,"LUCKNOW: About four-and-a-half years after the mysterious death of 15-year-old class 9 student, Rahul Sridhar, forensic experts recreated the crime scene at La Martiniere College on Thursday to decode the puzzle and sequence of events, but found injury patterns very different from those mentioned in the post-mortem report. On April 15, 2015, Rahul had died after falling from 55-foot high Constantia Building on the college campus, with multiple injuries. On Thursday, an eight-member team of forensic experts from Forensic Science Laboratory, Lucknow, reached the college with a 10-member police team headed by SHO Gautampalli, Satya Prakash Singh, to recreate the fall at crime scene by using two dummies. Police have stepped up investigation after the Supreme Court, on September 16, directed it to submit a detailed report on October 18, the next date of hearing. The parents of the deceased had filed a petition in the top court, contesting the closure report of police claiming the death to be suicide. The forensic experts used a dummy to recreate Rahul’s fall and used four different positions. In first, dummy was seated and then pushed, in the second it was pushed from standing posture, in the third it was flung in horizontal position and fourth replicating a jump from upright position. In all positions, the dummy sustained injuries on the head, face, chest, knees and even got torn on hitting the ground from a height of 55 feet. In none of the positions, did the dummy hit any ledge and fell straight on the ground, and the injuries did not match with those mentioned in the autopsy report in any case. According to the post-mortem report prepared by a panel of doctors, Rahul had died of head injury and excessive bleeding from wounds, nostrils and mouth. There were injuries on left, right and back of head, a 6x5 cm contusion on left side of face, and 2cm below left eye. There was also a 5x4 cm lacerated wound on left leg in front, 8cm below knee, and a 3x2 cm wound on right leg, 9cm below knee. Independent experts had pointed out that three injuries on head are impossible to have been caused by fall and added there should have been multiple fractures. The injuries on leg, without fracture, can only be caused by assault, they added. Senior scientist, FSL, A K Tiwari, who supervised the crime scene recreation, told TOI, “The whole exercise has been videographed and will be studied with help of medicolegal experts. We will file a report in a week.” "

The interesting part about the afternoon was the Q&amp;A session with the girls of the college. It was a fun session wherein the students asked Vartika umpteen questions regarding her pageant, beauty routine, the secret to becoming a pageant winner, etc. The most interesting question of how to convince your parents to let girls participate in beauty contest was beautifully answered by Vartika, who shared her personal journey with them which earned her a thunderous applause from the students. She told the students, ""I secretly filled up the form for the beauty pageant without telling anyone. After that I couldn’t look my father in the eye for almost a month, it was so scary. It was only after I got selected that I told him, and to my surprise, he was rather delighted, specially when people started calling him ‘Vartika’s papa’. My family was proud of me, it was the happiest feeling."" Later, she visited her home science department and recalled the good old college days reminiscing fun times with her college friends.

I’m just so overwhelmed with the whole welcome and everything that I got. Talking to the students and visiting my department was just amazing. I just wish I could go back in time and re-live all those days.” Speaking about meeting the teachers, Vartika added, “I was actually scared, wondering what if they remember that I bunked their classes.

Kanpur,LGBTQIA members organise a free hug activity in Kanpur,"The Supreme Court might have had decriminalised homosexuality almost a year back but this was the very first time when the members of LGBTQIA community in Kanpur came out in the open. The members of the community organised a free hug activity in the Swaroop Nagar area recently.

Amolak further adds, “After attending the Pride Parades and other LGBTQIA activities in Lucknow and Delhi, my friends and I, from the same community, decided to start similar activities in Kanpur.” Amolak further adds, “The apex court may have decriminalised homosexuality but majorly it is still seen as a taboo in our society. This is why, just to break the ice, we started a free hug activity on October 2.” Ishan Khan, a 19-year old psychology student, who too excitedly participated in the free hug activity representing the community, says, “Actually, free hug activity organised by us was a part of an experiment. With this activity we wanted to check our social acceptance in Kanpur. I am happy to say that the result of our activity was outstanding.

Lucknow,18th century Jain shrine inspires pandal’s 50th anniversary celebrations in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: A Durga Puja pandal inspired by the splendour of the 18th century Jain shrine Shikharji Temple is what’s in store for visitors to the Sindhi Vidyalaya Girls Inter College in Alambagh this year. The Dakshin Lucknow Welfare and Cultural Society Committee of Durga Puja — one of the oldest in Alambagh — is celebrating 50 years of its establishment this year. The committee has planned a grand three-day affair complete with traditions and rituals, which includes idols of deities put up against a ‘ekchala thakur’ (a common backdrop for all idols put up on the stage), at Sindhi Vidyalaya Girls Inter College. “The idols have been put up in the ‘ek chaler’ pattern, which means all idols are surrounded by a common halo. The idol of Ma Durga is draped in a red sari and adorned with gold jewellery. Her children — Lakshmi, Ganesh, Saraswati and Kartikey — are dressed in a similar attire. While lights and chandeliers light up the stage, the pandal’s hall resembles Shikharji Temple’s premises,” said general secretary of the committee SK Dev. Located atop the Parasnath Mountain in Jharkhand, the Shikharji Temple is considered one of the holiest shrines by the Jain community. Established in 1970, the committee takes pride in being one of the oldest in the city. “Back in 1970s, Alambagh wasn’t as developed as it is today. A few shops, a handful of homes and a gurdwara — these were the only signs of civilisation. Over time, a number of Bengalis also settled in the area strengthening the community’s presence. A group of 23 Bengalis decided to organise a Saraswati puja on Basant Panchami. Since then there was no looking back. Forty nine years later, the committee is over 50-member strong,” added Dev. Initially, the committee used to set up a Durga Puja pandal at a government school in Sringarnagar. The venue was later shifted to the Sindhi Girls Inter College in 1975. Dev said it was new generation’s responsibility for carrying forward this tradition. A Bengali resident of the area Nilashish Bose said that the pandal’s charm is that it attracts people of different religions. “Some of them even get involved to help us with the preparations. Even our idol is prepared by a Muslim idol maker,” Bose said. "
Lucknow,Vishwa Hindu Parishad sets up trishul sena ahead of Ayodhya verdict,"LUCKNOW: As Supreme Court conducts day-to-day hearings in the Ayodhya title suit, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which has been spearheading the Ram temple movement in Ayodhya, has quietly constituted a fresh batch of trident-armed cadre under its ‘Trishul Diksha’ programme in various parts of the state. VHP plans to complete the recruitments before the apex court delivers its verdict on the issue. Confirming the development, VHP organisational secretary Bholendra said the recruitment is being conducted through ‘Shakti Kendra’, where youths are being imparted training in use of tridents. Each Shakti Kendra comprises at least 100 to 200 youths. Sources said, VHP plans to distribute at least 10,000 tridents to its newly constituted force. “The purpose of the programme is to create a feisty cadre and remind Hindus about the importance of ‘shastra' (religious text) and ‘shastra’ (arms). They should not forget Hindu samaj has its roots in both,” he told TOI. He also confirmed that a programme is scheduled to be completed before the apex court delivers its verdict on the Ram Janmahoomi-Babri Masjid issue. “The purpose of the training is not restricted to Ram temple movement, but also preserving values of the country and society,” he said. VHP sources said as many as four to five ‘shakti kendras’ are being established in various cities of UP, where youth are being given arms training. The camps are being directly supervised by senior VHP functionaries, who visit various districts at least twice a month. VHP and its affiliate Bajrang Dal had conducted a similar exercise in 2017, when its functionaries distributed tridents to youths to check cow slaughter and ‘love jihad’. A senior VHP functionary said the trishul is not a big weapon and does not come under prohibited arms. Iqbal Ansari, one of the main litigants in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, said, “One cannot comment on any religious function. Nevertheless, the state government should keep vigil on such programmes.” "

Celebrating the 55th ITEC day on October 7, external affairs minister S Jaishankar will launch new modalities like e-ITEC and ITEC-onsite. He will also launch ITEC executive, a programme specially for senior level officers of partner countries for policy level engagement.

Focused on human resource development, the programme serves as a key tool for India's soft power diplomacy and is now recognised as a strong brand name in the field of capacity building assistance. The programme has grown from about 4,000 training slots in 2006-07 to about 11,000 slots in 2019-20 with the budget allocated for the scheme growing from Rs 60 crore in 2006-07 to Rs 200 crore in 2018-19. According to MEA sources, the budget estimate for 2019-20 will be around Rs 250 crore. Devyani Khobragade, joint secretary, development partnership administration-II, MEA, told TOI : ""India's relations with its partner countries are based on principles of equality, respect for territorial integrity, unity and national sovereignty. We do not want the freedom of action of our partners to be jeopardised in any manner through our well-meaning dialogue, interaction or economic cooperation with them. These foundational principles have guided our policies and programmes for South-South Cooperation.  ""India does not look at development cooperation through the donor recipient relationship but looks upon it as a partnership. Therefore, India aligns its development cooperation and priorities set by its partner countries themselves,"" she added.

Apart from the training courses in India, the programme also covers deputation of Indian experts abroad and study tours. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad DM finds Hindon full of filth and hyacinth, orders cleanup in a year","GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad administration has embarked on a plan to rejuvenate the Hindon river in a year. In one of the first measures undertaken, it has asked the irrigation department to remove hyacinth plants from the waterbody with immediate effect. The administration has decided to form a Hindon sanitation committee comprising members of the civil society. This panel will monitor all the activities being carried out for the river’s redevelopment and give “unbiased” feedback to the administration. Moreover, a civil sanitation force having boats and sanitation workers at its disposal will undertake regular cleaning of the river. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey on Friday conducted an inspection of the river and expressed displeasure over its bad condition. Pandey said, while he was the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) commissioner between 2007 and 2009, the corporation had implemented several projects related to its cleaning and beautification, but none of the works could be seen now. At that time, the river was cleaned and banks were beautified, stairs were constructed for easy access to the river and benches were installed on the banks at several spots, Pandey said. Finding a large portion of the river under the cover of hyacinth plants and garbage dumped along the river at several places between NH-58 and railway overbridge, he called officials from the irrigation department, municipal corporation and civil defence, among others and directed them to formulate a plan in order to bring back the river’s prior form. Pandey said, “The irrigation department has been given the responsibility of cleaning the river and removing hyacinth from the river. The department will buy weed harvesting machines for this purpose. However, till the time such machines are not bought, the irrigation department will carry out the cleaning work manually.” The responsibility of cleaning the banks has been given to the municipal corporation. The civic body has been asked to form a special team of sanitation workers for this purpose. The team will start its work after the Dussehra festival. The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has been directed to come up with a detailed plan for the landscaping and beautification of banks, while the forest department has been asked to carry out a plantation drive along the river. Meanwhile, members of the civil defence will assist various departments in their works. “We cannot leave the river at its own fate while waiting for big projects. It is our collective responsibility to keep the river clean. This can be achieved with routine work as well,” the DM said. "
Lucknow,"Rs 1 crore cheque fraud rocks Lucknow University, FIR against six companies","LUCKNOW: More than Rs 1 crore was siphoned off in 2018-19 from Lucknow University’s account with a nationalised bank through forged cheques cloned from the cheque book issued 19 years ago. The irregularities were detected during an audit by accounts department of LU, which on Friday lodged an FIR against six firms on charges of fraud, forgery, breach of trust and cheating. Officials said they got names of six firms from the “bank statement of account” having all records of deposits and withdrawals. “However, since their addresses were not mentioned anywhere, we have requested police to track down firms and take action,” said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh. The FIR also raises question on the role of bank officials as they did not cross-check with LU before releasing funds. LU has also asked senior bank officials to probe the matter at their end. As a precautionary measure, the university has shifted all its accounts to another nationalised bank. “Now, all payments will be done by the university through RTGS,” the VC said. “The serial numbers in 11 forged cheques used to withdraw money were copied from the cheques used by the university in 2000 for making payments to various agencies in lieu of work done by them. The fraudster cloned 19-year-old cheques, entered fresh amounts and withdrew money after forging signatures of officers authorised to sign on behalf of the university,” he added. The VC did not rule out the possibility of an insider in the scam and said each forged cheque was used to withdraw Rs 9-10 lakh. In June this year, a similar attempt was made to withdraw Rs 9.98 lakh in the name of ‘Lucknow University exam fund’. After the bank alert the university authorities, registrar SK Shukla cross-checked the details and found no such payment was made. An FIR was lodged in the case but the police have not been able to make any breakthrough in the case so far. The university is already struggling to solve the fake marksheet racket. "

Describing her participation as violation of party whip, Congress gave Aditi Singh a two-day deadline to reply. “After the party’s decision to boycott the special session, a whip was issued to members. The message was communicated to her, yet she defied the party line,” said Ajay Kumar Lallu, Congress Legislative Party leader. ‘Party should suspend Aditi’Aditi sprang a surprise with her sudden appearance in the house session on Wednesday. Also, she was conspicuous by her absence in Priyanka Gandhi’s ‘Maun Padyatra’ that was attended by over 10,000 party workers from across the state, despite being a legislator from Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s pocket borough Rae Bareli. While ruling BJP made the most of the occasion, Congress leaders were left numb amid speculation about Aditi’s imminent exit. With the Yogi government swiftly meeting Aditi’s demand to step up her security to Y+, added grist to rumour mills. Aditi’s request was pending since May when her cavalcade was attacked near the Bachchrawan toll. Congress workers in Rae Bareli led by district president V K Shukla staged a demonstration outside her residence and demanded her resignation. Raising slogans like ‘Satta ki gode mein baithna band karo nahi to istifa do’, the workers said Aditi’s act was betrayal. Voicing sentiments, Shukla said: “It appears Aditi has forgotten what she owes to the party.” Workers also urged the party high command to suspend Aditi. "
Lucknow,"La Martiniere murder: Rahul’s parents demand lie test on school staff, friends","LUCKNOW: The parents of Rahul Sridhar have termed the crime scene recreation of their son’s death in La Martiniere College an eyewash on the grounds that it was not done scientifically. They have instead demanded lie detector test on the school employees and Rahul’s classmates to find out whether Rahul was killed at a different spot in the college and his body placed outside the Constantia building on the campus. “As per the preliminary investigations, nobody saw Rahul entering or exiting Constantia. There are no CCTV cameras either which could have recorded Rahul’s movements. In such a scenario, there is a possibility that he might have been killed at another place and his body placed near the Constantia to make it appear as a death due to fall from the building,” said Rahul’s father V Sridharan. “Why are the police only probing the angle of death due to fall from 55-foot high Constantia. Why are they not examining the possibility of the boy being killed elsewhere and body placed at the spot later. Police should conduct polygraph and Narco test of school employees and Rahul’s friends for clues to crack the case,” he said. Sridharan said a private expert hired by them had studied Rahul’s postmortem report and stated that injuries on the body appeared to have been caused by a blunt object. “But the police and forensic experts have not probed this angle. The cops also did not try to find out Rahul’s movements explore on the day of incident by interrogating his friends and school employees,” he added. “We can only hope of getting justice if a neutral agency like CBI probes the case,” Rahul’s mother Annama Sridharan told TOI. The parents had demanded a CBI probe in 2017 too but the high court had rejected their plea. On Thursday, forensic experts had recreated the crime scene on La Martiniere College campus to find clues that can help solve Rahul’s mysterious death. Rahul Sridhar, a class IX student of La Martiniere College, was found dead on the college campus on April 10, 2015. Police probe concluded that the boy had committed suicide by jumping from Constantia. But Rahul’s parent alleged that their son was killed.

This made police to swung into action and recreate crime scene to find out cause of death. "

Lucknow,"Ramlila, namaz unite at this twin Mandir-Masjid in UP","LUCKNOW: On a late evening in Varanasi, the muezzin’s call for namaz and chaupais from Ramayana echo together. At the Lath Bhairav Mandir and adjoining Lath Masjid, while Ramlila artists invoked Ram, Muslims offered namaz. The harmonious practice on the joint premises has continued for over three centuries and completed 350 years this year. An open platform houses both the mosque and the temple in close proximity, just 500m from Varanasi’s Raj Ghat. On Tuesday, when the scene of “jayant netra bhang” was being performed at the roving Ramlila at Lath Bhairav premises, Muslims were bowing to Allah in maghrib (sunset) prayers. “Since 1543, Ramlila is being performed on this chabootra (raised platform) and for 350 years, namaz too is being offered. When this scene would be enacted on navmi, Ramlila and namaz would be held side by side,” said spokesperson for Lath Bhairav temple, Vikas Yadav. Ramlila began well before evening namaz and went on for another 30 minutes. After Muslims offer prayers, they too become part of the audience. “This is our culture where both Hindus and Muslims coexist. There has never been trouble and both namaz and Ramlila are conducted in harmony every year,” said Lath Masjid’s 63-year-old caretaker Anisur Rahman. “Eight years ago, a puja at the mandir and 21st Ramzan roza iftar at the mosque were simultaneously held and we have kept this tradition alive,” said Rahman.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: 50 automobile workshops get notice over parking,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has issued notices to 50 automobile repair shops in Rajnagar District Centre for permanently occupying the parking space and also carrying out work that harms the environment. The shop owners have been asked to stop the violations within a week. The GDA officials said if the shops do not follow the directions, they will be sealed and a fine will also be imposed on them. Meanwhile, chief architect and town planner Asheesh Shivpuri informed that dozens of automobile repair shops behind the malls are using the parking areas for their own commercial purposes. “Vehicles, which come for repair, remain parked in the area for several days. We are taking pictures of the area during the night and giving them to the police. Subsequently, the police will take action against such shops,” he added. “The parking is meant for visitors. However, the automobile repair shops are encroaching upon them. In such a scenario, visitors park their vehicles on roads, which lead to traffic snarls. Our survey has revealed that even a small repair shop has around 10 cars and they remain parked all day and night,” the official said. The GDA plans to make the road in front of two RDC malls vehicle free by January 1 next year. Under the plan, a parking space will be created behind the malls. The place is not very far away from the shops. Officials said, it has now become important to make the area free from encroachments. "
Lucknow,For Saand Ki Aankh I had to go back to my roots: Composer-singer Vishal Mishra in Lucknow,"Music composer Vishal Mishra, who recently topped the charts with his 'Kabir Singh' song 'Kaise Hua', was in the city some time back. The singer and composer from Unnao in UP, started his journey from reality shows and has climbed the ladder to win millions of heart through his music in films like 'Qarib Qarib Single', 'Race 3' and 'Kabir Singh', among others. This time the singer-composer’s song Womaniya from Saand Ki Aankh is making waves already. Talking about how he composed the music of film with a rural set-up, Vishal says, “That’s where I belong to. For 'Saand Ki Aankh', I had to go back to my roots and then find a way to mix it with today’s sound and structure. It took me three years and some 100 plus musicians to compose the songs for the film. But I’m so glad that finally when it’s, out people are liking it.” Vishal, who visited Lucknow for a gig, says he feels excited to perform so close to his hometown, ""This is special because people have been texting me since Kabir Singh that why am I not coming to UP and doing gigs here. And it makes me very happy that I am pfinally performing so close to my house in front of ‘my’ people. This is a feeling of homecoming. And performing here in the city, where I have stood in queues of lakhs just to give an audition, it is a very welcoming thought, especially when it comes with a remuneration (laughs). It is indeed a beautiful feeling."" Vishal Mishra (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Vishal Mishra (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Feeling grateful for the success he’s tasting with his music, the singer shares the hard work he’s put behind it. “We’ve been so industrious in our work and you can see the dark circles under our eyes because of the sleepless nights. But I guess this is what I wanted to do in life, so no complaints. And I think every artist has that restlessness in them that doesn’t allow them to sleep or be calm at any place, for that matter. And that restlessness is what brings the best out of them. That is the curse an artist is blessed with. You either give up to it or you make it your part and start to make music that sounds different. I feel extremely grateful for whatever is happening in my life right now,” he says. Sharing memories of his early days struggles the singer says, “Being from a middle-class family, it was tough for me to make my parents understand that music and singing is a profession also. For my father music just meant jamming, it was just treated as a hobby. And I am so glad people could dream of becoming singers from these cities because of me. They’d think that there is a guy who has come out of this place only. It makes me really happy when people send me messages saying their parents are letting them pursue singing as a career. I am so glad that they don’t have to lie in their homes. I remember I used to catch a local at 5:30 from Unnao and give auditions in Lucknow, not get selected, and get back to Unnao at midnight, get scolded and would go to school the very next day. But thankfully youngsters don’t have to do that now.” Vishal Mishra (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Vishal Mishra (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Giving credit for his success to the place he belongs to, Vishal praises Uttar Pradesh and shares how it has influenced his life, “I really love Uttar Pradesh, I think everything I have in my life belongs to this place. We are absolutely the most sentimental breed of people that can ever exist. People here are so authentic and this place has got that emotion quotient a little on the higher side because we go through so many things since we’re born. We can see the most urban cultures out here when we go through Hazratganj and see how beautiful Lucknow is and we can still go to Aminabad and figure out what life is all about. People rushing for their daily of bread. I don’t think anywhere else you’ll get to see such different worlds within just a drive of 10 minutes. In Mumbai, it’ll take you two hours to see both the worlds. I remember having a bike and I used to go on rides on it because there was a girl that I had to meet on the bridge who used to come on a bicycle. I don’t know how people would do that in Mumbai. These are the experiences that have helped me be a better musician and a better human being. Yahan ka jo personal touch hai, in everything.” Ask him about the music he loves to create and whether he falls prey to creating a song bank and fits in any song in any film. “My music is script-driven. I create music according to the script and the story. When the script demands a song on a medical student who has anger issues and falls madly in love with a girl, we made Kaise Hua. When people asked to make for a song on a long-distance relationship we made Pehla Pehla Pyaar Hai. If a divorced man, who is 40 years old, falls in love with somebody but does not express it because of the intricacies of life, we made Jaane De. I think that is what an artist is blessed with, he gets to live a thousand lives in one. And if the scripts demands me to make a Hip Hop song I’m all game for it. I don’t want to make music just for the sake of making it. My music should make people comfortable,” says Vishal, adding, “I am a lonely person, and I know most people out there are lonely despite having companions. There is some part of you that you never share with anybody and my music should become a companion to them whether it is Hip Hop or R&amp;B or any other genre for that matter. I make music that stays with a person. SO for each film, I prefer it to be custom-made,” he reiterates. Shying away from the trend of remixes the singer said he’s just bad at it, “I don’t do remixes. It is not like that I haven’t tried. I have been offered remixes and I have tried remixes but I failed miserably. I think I don’t have the skill set to do remixes.” But on the other hand Vishal said he loves the concept of remixes, “I actually don’t mind the culture of recreation. I feel if a person has composed a song in the ‘80s or the ‘90s, and has no work today, and if his song gets recreated, he gets royalty money. He gets food which is more important than anybody’s views or opinions. If there is a hungry musician who had done a song years ago and his song has faded out and a new composer recreates his song and the royalty money goes to the old composer, so I like the fact that something like this is happening.” "
Lucknow,Lots to explore at the Durga Puja pandals in Lucknow,"Durga Puja pandals in the city have always made news for their unique themes and grand decor. And just like every year, this year too the oragnisers of several Durga puja pandals have left no stone unturned to make their pandal arrangements a hit among Lucknowites. To start with the huge pandal at Sahara States, Jankipuram is a must-visit as you’ll get to witness a Baahubali themed pandal which is inspired by the Hindi-Telegu blockbuster Baahubali. The unique pandal is a replica of the Maheshmati palace shown in the film. The 40,198 square feet area covered by the pandal is attracting more than two lakh people daily. The pandal is also a major draw with people of all ages with rides, swings, food stalls and also cultural performances which give a feel of a carnival. “A team of 70 workers from different parts of West Bengal, divided into 12 teams started their work in early August to prepare this pandal,” says Saurav Bandhyopadhyay, the organiser. “It took us two months to finish all the work. In between, rain played a spoilsport but we managed to finish the pandal in time. The devotees who come to celebrate pujo are in very large numbers and the number gets doubled every day. Ashtami and Navami mein toh 3-4 lakh tak log aate hain,” adds Bandyopadhyay. Sahara States (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Sahara States (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) The Durga Puja at Cantonment completes 67 years this year. Celebrating with a theme of Chandrayaan 2, the speciality of this pandal lies in the dais where the idol of goddess Durga is kept which is made of marble. “This year we have decided Chandrayaan 2 as the theme and we dedicate this year’s celebration to the ISRO mission. Last year we had Rafale as the theme. The best part about our puja is that it is celebrated together by army personnel and civilians; one cannot find this kind of beautiful amalgamation anywhere else in the city. We also conduct an aarti competition where several people participate. We even felicitate the winners with gifts. Every year we celebrate Durga Puja based on themes keeping our country in mind. We have a lot of cultural programs that take place at our pandal including dance and singing performances. Apart from that we also have kids who do plays and orchestra performances. This puja is the oldest and the only puja in the Cantonment,” informs SN Pal, one of the organizers of the puja. Anand Nagar (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Anand Nagar (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Another must-see pandal is the one at Chandra Shekhar Azad Park in Aliganj. Giving a feel of a village, the theme of the pandal is ethnic and the whole area from start to end is decorated like a traditional village. Dance, music events and band performances are the highlight of the pandal in Aliganj. “We’ve been organizing this puja from the past 47 years and if a person will visit our pandal he will surely get nostalgic as this time we’ve decorated it like a village. It gives a feeling of how Durga Puja is celebrated in a Bengali village. The pratima (idol) is one of the most beautiful in the city,” says organizer Tuhin Banerjee. The team of Indranil Bagchi and Puja Bagchi is responsible for the decoration of the pandal, “It took us around a month to build and decorate the pandal,” says Indranil. Aliganj (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Aliganj (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Also a not-to-be-missed pandal is the Shashwat Durga Puja Park in Vikas Nagar. Celebrated every year on a grand note, the Durga Puja this year at Vikas Nagar is no less grand. The pandal is a replica of the Mysore Palace. This 80 feet tall pandal is made of more than 2500 bamboo sticks to construct. The variety of swings and rides in the park is attracting children the most while youngsters can enjoy food stalls set up there. “The kind of eye we’ve made in our pratima is unique as no other pandal in Lucknow has made it like us. It’s the tana chhok which is also called as the ‘fish eye’. Another speciality is the saaj that we have used in the idol. It has been brought all the way from Kumurtuli in Kolkata. Besides the beautiful idol, we also are organising cultural programs including dandiya raas performance and other music performances, magic shows to entertain the crowd,” says Sumeet Kumar Bhowmick, one of the organizers. - Saad Abbasi Vikas Nagar (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Vikas Nagar (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Vikas Nagar (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) Vikas Nagar (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal) "

Lucknow,Congress turns up heat on another MLA for attending UP assembly special session,"LUCKNOW: A day after slapping a showcause notice on Rae Bareli Sadar MLA Aditi Singh for defying the partyline and attending the special session of UP Assembly, Congress on Saturday shifted focus on another rebel MLA, Rakesh Singh, seeking implementation of the Speaker’s verdict for defying the party whip on an earlier occasion. Rakesh, the brother of rebel MLC Dinesh Singh, is MLA from Harchandpur. He had also attended the 36-hour special Assembly session despite the Opposition’s call to boycott it. Earlier, Congress had given a notice to the Vidhan Sabha Speaker, seeking termination of Rakesh’s membership after he had defied the party and attended the Assembly session on an earlier occasion. The office of the Speaker had issued two notices to Rakesh on June 21 and August 27, but Rakesh remained defiant, prompting Congress leaders to claim that he was enjoying the patronage of BJP. “Rakesh Singh has been involved in anti-party activities for quite some time. He has shared a stage with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and even campaigned for his brother who is now in BJP,” said Ajay Kumar Lallu, Congress CLP leader. “We have been pursuing the matter with the Speaker, but nothing has come of it. The party is helpless as it is akin to a case being heard in court and the judge taking time in delivering the order,” he said. In the special session, Rakesh had called CM Yogi Adityanath and PM Narendra Modi the “Mahatma Gandhis of today”. "
Lucknow,Delhi &amp; Bihar firms duped Lucknow University of Rs 1.9 crore,"LUCKNOW: Police on Saturday tracked the owners of seven firms—one from Delhi and six from Bihar—against whom the Lucknow University had lodged an FIR for siphoning off over Rs 1.9 crore from its account in a nationalised bank through 11 forged cheques. According to LU’s bank account statement, a Delhi-based electrical company withdrew around Rs 50 lakh through five forged cheques while six Bihar-based firms, of which two are construction companies, siphoned off around Rs 9-10 lakh each. Inspector, Hassanganj police station, Dhirendra Kushwaha said: “The addresses of account holders have been tracked. A team will question the owners and, if required, arrest them for further investigation.” “The money was transferred from LU’s account to those of the firms in other banks. We tracked the addresses of firms from banks where they had accounts,” he added. The money was withdrawn from the university’s account in last financial year. The serial numbers of all the cheques were same as the ones issued by LU to make payments in 2000. The signatures of officers authorised to sign financial instruments were forged to withdraw money. The scam was detected during an audit after which LU lodged an FIR against six firms and shifted all its accounts to another nationalised bank. "
Lucknow,"Shooed away from dhaba, bull runs amok, injures one in Lucknow","LUCKNOW: Panic gripped a stretch near a private school in Indiranagar on Saturday when a bull ran amok for around 10 minutes. One person was injured and many others were forced to take shelter in shops to save themselves. According to onlookers, the incident occurred when a stray bull, which had been strolling in the area for several days, tried to feed on a packet of bread on the counter of a roadside dhaba. People at the eatery tried to scare it away. The animal, which was apparently hungry, reacted angrily and attacked the group, leaving one person injured. It then ran amok in the area, leading to panic. People ran for cover and even traffic halted for some time. TimesViewThe state government had set March 3 as the deadline to shift all stray cattle to shelter homes. However, LMC has not been able to accomplish the task even seven months later. Though it cites lack of hands as the main cause of failure, it has to find a way out. It can outsource the task or ask government for staff. Rehabilitation of stray animals will not only help the people, but also the animals themselves.Tanmay Saraswat, an eyewitness, said, “We were standing outside the shop when suddenly the bull came near the shop and started eating the bread. When people tried to stop it, it attacked us—it all happened very quickly.” Five citizens died in 21 attacks by stray cattleAccording to records, this is the 21st case of attack by stray cattle in Lucknow this year. While five people have lost their lives during such conflicts, in others, people have been injured badly. LMC chief veterinary officer Arvind Rao said, “We had sent our teams to catch stray cattle in that area and most have been caught. However, we will send squads again to Indiranagar to conduct a campaign again.” "
Lucknow,Security blueprint chalked out for Ayodhya verdict,"LUCKNOW/AYODHYA: Gearing up for the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya title suit, the state government has begun preparations to put in place a mammoth security cover around the temple town. To begin with, authorities are identifying campuses of schools and colleges to house additional police and paramilitary forces, which will be mobilized from across the country. Also, security agencies have identified at least 42 entry-exit points around Ayodhya district, which are crucial for crowd management along district borders. Intelligence units have already been activated in neighbouring districts. The security apparatus was activated after chief minister Yogi Adityanath told police brass at a law and order review meet in Lucknow on September 25 to raise vigil in the state before the apex court verdict, expected in November. He ordered police to begin the groundwork at the police station level by holding meetings with different groups and activating intelligence agencies. ‘Shortlisting 50 schools to house forces’He directed cops to keep an eye on those who could use this as an excuse to trigger anarchy after abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Talking to TOI on Saturday, additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said, “We conducted a routine security review of Ayodhya at a meeting chaired by the chief secretary. All security aspects were taken into account, including contingencies.” Sharing details of preparations, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ayodhya Ashish Tewari said final touches were being given to the security blueprint. “Our priority is to arrange proper accommodation of additional forces. We are scouring schools and colleges for housing our forces,” Tewari told TOI. He said additional forces have already been sought. “Mobilisation of forces from outside Ayodhya is likely to begin from first week of November,” he said. Sources said, the administration is shortlisting at least 50 schools to accommodate the forces. Senior officers associated with security arrangements said a similar mobilisation of forces was undertaken in 2010 when Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on the title suit. More than 10,000 security personnel were deployed, including central paramilitary forces. "

The retired manager, Malkhan Singh (78), told police that DIOS Pankaj Pandey is an acquaintance and used to visit him for official work, when he was posted in Ghaziabad. Pandey is now posted in Shahjahanpur district of UP. Singh alleged that Pandey took the bribe promising the former’s son a job in the education department. “Pandey offered a job to my son in the district education department and demanded Rs 1 lakh. Upon getting the money, he assured that within two months a joining letter in the name of my son will be given to me. However, he didn’t provide anything. Instead, he threatened and abused me over the phone,” Singh added. “I gave him Rs 1 lakh on January 23 in his office. On June 26, when I went to Pandey's office in Ghaziabad and asked him to return my money, he started abusing me. He also threatened me,” he said. “Pandey also tried to beat me up in his office, but his colleagues came to the rescue.

Lucknow,Kingpins of Ghaziabad firm that cheated 1.5 lakh investors held after 2 years on run,"AGRA: After two years on the run, two of the main accused in an internet Ponzi scam, which was busted in Ghaziabad in 2017 and is believed to have cheated over nearly 1.5 lakh investors, many of them in Delhi-NCR, were arrested by Agra police on Saturday. An FIR was lodged at Sikandra police station here against the director and associates of a Ghaziabad-based IT firm in 2017. Varun Kumar, a resident of Ghaziabad’s Crossings Republik, and his associate Amit Saxena, a resident of Omaxe Forest Spa in Noida, were picked up from Gurgaon and Lucknow, respectively. The duo is originally from UP’s Bijnor district. According to police, in order to dodge arrest, Saxena regularly changed his location while Gupta maintained a low profile. In 2016, Varun Kumar alias Varun Gupta along with Aman Sharma — a resident of Bijnor’s Dhampur — floated an IT firm named Payway IT Solutions Private Limited in consultation with Saxena. The company was based in Pacific Business Park, Sahibabad. Co-founder Sharma and another accused, Saxena’s wife Juhi, are still on the run. Police sources claimed that around 1.5 lakh investors of UP, Haryana, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Punjab were duped in less than six months of an estimated Rs 1,000 crore. SSP, Agra, Babloo Kumar told TOI, “The matter came to light in Agra, after a local resident, Yashpal, lodged an FIR at Sikandra against the director and other associates of the IT firm. Yashpal had invested Rs 13.8 lakh that included money of his 14 family members. Soon, he realised he was cheated like other investors. Later, we found a few more FIRs were registered against the company at Link road police station of Ghaziabad and cyber police station of Gurgaon.” He added, “We have applied for their remand in court to probe the case further, since we are yet to ascertain the number of victims directly affected by Ponzi scheme, the exact amount swindled, number of people involved, and where the money was diverted to. Initial probe suggests the money was used in buying properties in Noida and Gurgaon.” The company, according to police, floated a pyramid scheme around October 2016 by asking people to click on ‘www.webpagelike.com’ and also view advertisements on Youtube, Instagram and Facebook. It employed the same method as Anubhav Mittal’s Social Trade, the biggest Ponzi scheme to have been busted in NCR in recent years. Payway’s scheme offered three broad plans of Rs 18,000, Rs 57,000 and Rs 1,15,000 and each ‘like’ would credit Rs 0.5 to Rs 2.7 into the scheme holder’s account. It was compulsory for investors to ensure 350 ‘likes’ a day for which they were to be paid Rs 230 to Rs 970 a day. Investors were further asked to introduce the scheme to two other persons that would “double their earnings”. "

Ghaziabad,A mechanised multi-tier parking lot in Indirapuram,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) plans to construct the city’s first mechanised multi-level parking facility in Indirapuram. Vehicles in this new space will be parked using machines, officials said. The Authority officials added that the work will be based on a public private partnership (PPP) model. The work order for the construction has been issued to the company, which will start ground work by next week and in one year the MLP will be ready, the officials added. “A 1,600 sqm area near Swarn Jayanti Park in Indirapuram has been earmarked for the construction of the mechanised MLP, which will be developed by Bubeck Technologies on PPP model,” said Kanchan Verma, GDA vice chairperson. “The MLP will have a mechanism, under which vehicles will be lifted and placed in parking slots by machines,” added Verma. The MLP will have a capacity to accommodate 200 cars and 100 two-wheelers at any point in time. The MLP will be up to five storeys (excluding ground floor) in height. As per the arrangement, the private company will develop the MLP at an estimated cost of Rs 6 crore. It will be allowed to operate and run the MLP for a period of 25 years and in return it will pay GDA a sum of Rs 3 lakh annually. “According to the arrangement, we will provide land to Bubeck Technologies where it will construct the MLP at its own cost. In return, they will be allowed to operate it for a period of 25 years, after which it will be handed back to the GDA,” said Verma. As per other clauses of the agreement with the company, 25% of the total area will be developed into commercial units through which company will recover its cost. “Since the project is under PPP-mode, we have given ample opportunity to the company to recover its cost. In 25% of the area, it has the permission to construct commercial units that can house cyber cafe, food court, travel agency, cafeteria among others,” said Verma. “The company will also pay Rs 3 lakh a year to the GDA, with a hike of 5% annually,” added Verma. The parking fee, however, has still not been fixed as it will be decided once the MLP is ready next year. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: SP workers sell onions outside MP V K Singh’s house, held","GHAZIABAD: Six Samajwadi Party workers were arrested on Saturday for allegedly staging a protest outside the house of Ghaziabad MP retired General V K Singh against the hiked prices of onion. However, later in the day they were granted bail. The protesters tried to sell onions for Rs 20 per kg outside Singh’s house and raised slogans against the ruling BJP government.

We have arrested them in order to maintain law and order in the area and have booked them under Section 151 of the CrPc.” However, the arrested party workers were granted bail when they were produced in a city court later in the day. Meanwhile, former city president of Samajwadi Party Rahul Chaudhary said the protesters did not inform the high command of the party before carrying out the protest, but added that selling onions outside an MP’s house is not a crime. “The country is already feeling the pressure of high prices of onions and so many people have stopped using it in their kitchen.

The teams would examine health of as many as 5.66 lakh people and try to identify TB patients among them, said district TB officer Dr G K Mishra. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has fixed a target to eradicate TB from India by 2025.

Lucknow,"UP: Week after brawl &amp; suspension, KGMU doctors ready for peace","LUCKNOW: A week after a brawl between two groups of resident doctors at KGMU, one group — that of orthopedic doctors — have agreed in principle to withdraw the FIR lodged against their counterparts in the medicine department. The medicine resident doctors have, however, not confirmed whether they will also withdraw the FIR lodged against the orthopedic resident doctors. On September 30, Dr Dhirendra Kumar of the orthopedic department had lodged an FIR against 19 resident doctors of the medicine department, including a female doctor, for rioting, assault and making racist remarks against scheduled castes and tribes. “Both the groups have now agreed to withdraw their cases.

While Dr Rajeev was contacted several times by TOI, he did not confirm any details, but another medicine resident doctor, who was attacked in the brawl, confirmed the possibility of a compromise. “We are thinking about withdrawing the case. Developments in the matter will be made public on Monday,” said Dr Krishna Pal Parmar of the medicine group. SHO Chowk Pankaj Singh said a probe in the case is underway and details provided by both groups are being recorded. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Perched on top berth, fell with a thud","LUCKNOW: Atul Kulkarni's family liked to start the day with a ritual - a conversation over a cup of tea. While travelling on the Double Decker Express on Sunday morning the family was doing just that when Atul sloshed the tea on his hand after feeling a jolt. Before he could understand anything, people started shouting ' train derail ho gayi' (the train has derailed). He managed to gather his senses and rushed towards the door with his wife and children. ""Everyone was screaming. I was rushing towards the door and trying to get out, but the train stopped. We had a narrow escape,"" Kulkarni told TOI over the phone on Sunday. Kulkarni and over 500 other passengers had a lucky escape when the New Delhi-bound train derailed at Katghar near Moradabad around 10am on Sunday. Though no one was injured, some of the passengers recounted the traumatic experience while talking to TOI. Delhi resident Raavish Khan had came to Lucknow to meet a friend, but the accident was one of the reasons why he could never forget the visit. He boarded the train from Lucknow Junction on Saturday and was to reach Anand Vihar Railway Station around 5am on Sunday. ""I was sleeping on my berth, when I was jolted and fell down from my berth with a thud. On stepping out of the train, I saw that two coaches had derailed. I can't thank God enough for keeping me safe,"" he added. For some passengers like Anshuman Sharma, the accident was an eye opener. ""How can I ever rely on train services now. I hear about trains derailing almost every other day, but today I experienced the horror myself. What if it was much worse than this? As ministers get busy inaugurating new trains, no one thinks about what causes these derailments. I have decided not to travel in a train ever again."" Kunal Keshav Kohli, who is a senior citizen, said, ""I thought a double decker train was a safe option. However, I no longer think so. My wife and I are old and can't run fast like most other passengers. When the coaches skidded off tracks, my wife started crying while holding my shirt. I couldn't do anything except console her."" The repair of tracks following the accident affected the operations of 12 other trains on Sunday. The list of delayed trains included Swarn Shatabdi, Gorakhpur Express, Lucknow Mail, New Delhi AC Express, Danapur Express, New Jalpaiguri Express and Barauni Express. "
Lucknow,Rajnath Singh to perform Shastra Puja after receiving Rafale jet in Paris on Tuesday,"NEW DELHI: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will on Tuesday perform 'Shastra Puja' (worship of weapons) on the occasion of Dussehra after receiving the first of 36 Rafale jets in the French port city of Bordeaux, officials said. After performing puja, he will take a sortie in the aircraft, they said. Singh has been performing 'Shastra Puja' for last several years including during his tenure as the Union Home Minister in the previous NDA government. The defence minister will leave for Paris on a three-day visit on Monday, primarily to receive the first Rafale fighter jet on Tuesday -- the foundation day of the Indian Air Force as well as the day when Dussehra will be celebrated. Singh will perform 'Shastra Puja' after receiving the first Rafale fighter jet at Merignac suburb of Bordeaux on Tuesday. After performing puja, he will take a sortie in the aircraft, the officials said. Before leaving for Bordeaux on the morning of Tuesday, Singh will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and is expected to discuss issues relating to defence and security ties between the two countries. The ceremony to hand over the Rafale jet will take place at a facility of Dassault Aviation, the makers of the aircraft, in Merignac of Bordeaux, which is at a distance of around 590 km from Paris. Though Singh will receive the first of the 36 Rafale jets on Tuesday, the first batch of four aircraft will come to India only by May next year. ""The defence minister will participate in the Rafale handing over ceremony at Merignac along with French Minister of Armed Forces Florence Parly. He will also perform the Shastra puja on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami and fly a sortie in the Rafale fighter aircraft,"" Defence Ministry Spokesperson Bharat Bhusan Babu said. Later Singh will hold the annual defence dialogue with Parly during which both sides will explore ways to further deepen defence and security ties. On October 9, Singh will address the CEOs of leading French defence firms during which he is likely to urge them to participate in the ""Make in India"" in defence sector in India, Babu said. Singh is also likely to invite them to the DefExpo to be held in Lucknow from February 5 to 8 next year. Defence and security ties between India and France were on an upswing in the last few years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited France in August during which both sides resolved to further enhance the already close defence ties. Sources said a high-level team of the Indian Air Force is already in France to coordinate with the French officials on the handing over ceremony. India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 59,000 crore. The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons and missiles. The IAF has already completed preparations, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots, to welcome the fighter aircraft. The sources said the first squadron of the aircraft will be deployed at Ambala air force station, considered one of the most strategically located bases of the IAF. The Indo-Pak border is around 220 km from there. The second squadron of Rafale will be stationed at Hasimara base in West Bengal. A number of IAF teams have already visited France to help Dassault Aviation incorporate India-specific enhancements on-board the fighter aircraft. The Rafale jets will come with various India-specific modifications, including Israeli helmet-mounted displays, radar warning receivers, low band jammers, 10-hour flight data recording, infra-red search and tracking systems among others.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Durga, Dandiya In Divine Blend On Ashtami","LUCKNOW: Festivities filled the air on Sunday as devotees thronged Durga puja pandals and formed serpentine queues at temples for Maha Ashtami prayers. At the 48-year-old Ramakrishna Math, Ashtami puja began at 5 am amid melodious tunes of shehnai, followed by Kumari puja. Remembering the goddess in her ‘Chamunda avatar’ (a form of goddess Durga who killed demons Chand and Munda), various Durga Puja committees across the city performed ‘Sandhi Puja’. The puja is an intersection of Ashtami (eighth day) and Navami (ninth day), and the time often falls in the last 24 minutes of Maha Ashtami and first 24 minutes of Maha Navami. To invoke the goddess, 108 earthen lamps are lit and 108 lotus flowers, fruits and vegetables are ritualistically offered to the deity. The legend behind the offering is associated with Lord Rama. “He worshipped Durga in her Mahishasur Mardini avatar to seek her blessings to defeat demon king Ravana. Sandhi Puja is the key highlight of the festival and is conducted to wash away one’s sins,” said Samarjit Mitra, organiser of Aliganj’s Milan Sangho Durga Puja. Debu Mitra of Rabindrapalli Kali Badi Trust said 108 lotus and lamps signified 108 names of Maa Durga. Trans-Gomti Durga puja ushered in festivities with a colouful splash of flowers and thousands of devotees in line. “The puja began at 6 am and culminated with ‘Pushpanjali’ (offering of flowers to the goddess). Devotees showered flowers on Durga idols and chanted hymns,” said president of the committee Dr DK Kaschaudhary. Arindam Das, a devotee at Rabindrapalli puja pandal, said: “Durga puja and Ashtami prayers are incomplete without delicious Bengali preparations. Ashtami ‘bhog’ is usually different from that on other days of puja where khichdi, baigan bhaja and mixed vegetables, along with a sweet dish, are served to devotees.” "

Lucknow,Mini-Gujarat swirls to garba beats in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: A mixed concoction of a traditional theme, garba revellers dressed in vibrant hot ‘chaniya cholis’ and ‘kediyus’ and a live dhol. This is not a glimpse of the world’s largest dance festival in Gujarat but a mini-Gujarat in the Uttar Pradesh capital. A teacher by profession, Jaya Pandya has been turning her Gomtinagar residence into a mini-Gujarat for 70-100 odd Gujaratis in the city for the past 20 years. To showcase the rich and vibrant Gujarati culture, the Pandya family has kept alive the tradition of the Gujarati folk dance and takes pride in being the “oldest garba organiser among their community”. This year, the Pandya residence will again be a host on Monday to a number of garba enthusiasts who will put their best put forward. “There are numerous venues organising garba and dandiya-raas, but they lack a traditional touch. Initially, we used to be a part of garba-raas at Hatkeshwar Mandir, but there was a thin crowd. Therefore, I started hosting a garba festival at my house in 2001,” said Jaya, who has been living in the city for the past 27 years. She said: “Garba is a circle of faith... It celebrates the divine power of goddess Amba. The word garba means womb in English. It is traditionally performed around a big ‘garba deep’ (a clay pot with earthen lamp) representing life in a mother’s womb. Dancing around the earthen pot is more of a ritual and we abide by it. Later, we also play dandiya.” In the beginning, Jaya started the event with a handful of 10-15 Gujarati families. Today, more than 150 Gujarati families are part of the celebration. “In the past 6-7 years, a few families did start organising garba-raas at home, but they couldn’t continue it. I continue to hold it at home due to religious beliefs. Age is no barrier... you can see a five-year-old dancing to the tunes too. Men, women and kids all become a part of it,” she added. "
Lucknow,UP: This six-year-old goddess with lotus in hand blesses devotees,"LUCKNOW: Draped in red saree, adorned with garlands and a lotus in one hand, six-year-old Ananya Banerjee resembled goddess Durga as priests performed the annual ritual of Kumari Puja on the occasion of Maha Ashtami at Ramakrishna Math on Sunday. Amid resonating sound of auspicious ululudhvani (a high-pitch sound produced by Bengali women) and chants ofmantrasand shlokas, hundreds of devotees at the jam-packed pandal had their eyes fixed on the girl, who sat gracefully all through the two-hour ritual. The little goddess had undergone a month-long training for the ritual. President of Ramakrishna Math Swami Muktinathananda said, “She was given a month-long training so that she understands that the ritual will take place in front of hundreds of people, who will visit the Math to worship her. Her parents were advised to inform her about the ceremony and treat her like a goddess.” Mayur Sen, a visitor, said: “The ritual is an integral part of Durga Puja and is believed to bring good luck to people attending it. The girl is chosen from the family of devotees who are associated with Ramakrishna Mission.” Swami Muktinathananda said it was the purest form of ‘Devi puja’ that they conducted. “Manifestation of the divine is maximum in young girls who are not yet influenced by materialistic forces. Every year, a new girl is given the stature of a ‘Kumari’. This year, we worshipped the six-year-old as goddess Uma – the voice of freedom and strength,” he added. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Once worshipped as ‘kumaris’, they still invoke mystical aura","LUCKNOW: Years ago, when they were kids, they were worshipped by priests and devotees on Kumari Puja – a ritual started by Swami Vivekananda in Belur 118 years ago –performed on the eighth day of Durga Puja. Since then, the tradition is being followed across every branch of Ramakrishna Mission across India. But what happens to the girl, chosen to represent the divine power, after puja? TOI spoke to two such Kumaris, who feel that the day transformed their lives forever. Madhu Banerjee (60) of Gomtinagar, who works as a health expert for a non-profit organisation, distinctly remembers the day of Ashtami in 1965. She was only six when her mother dressed her up in a red Banarasi saree. “It was a chilly morning in Dehradun. I was told I will be seeing a lion in front of me. But the moment I sat in front of Durga’s idol and handed over a lotus, I fell in a trance. I kept calm when the crowd was actually frightening. I can still feel the thrill,” said Madhu. “I was suffering from cancer in 1993 but each time I remembered Maa Durga, a surge of energy and ‘shakti’ (power) helped me,” she said. Smritika Banerjee (36), was popular in her neighborhood for her melodious voice. In 1988, she was worshipped as a Kumari at the age of five. “Since then, I have established a personal connect with the deity. I felt important. I remember the moment the priest told me to bless my parents and grandparents, I felt shy. Even my father felt a little uneasy. But the moment, I placed my hand on his head to bless him, he got emotional,” said Smritika, who is working as a marketing personnel in Bengaluru. “Swami Muktinathananda guided me to pursue a subject I was interested in. Today, I am a successful employee at a multi-national company,” she added. President, Ramakrishna Math, Swami Muktinathananda said, “By worshipping a Kumari, we feel that divine mother is physically present among us. The tradition is symbolic of worshipping a divine being in human form.” "

Lucknow,Lucknow: KGMU foils bid to siphon off Rs 2 crore via cloned cheque,"LUCKNOW: After Lucknow University detected siphoning of Rs 1.9 crore via cloned cheques, King George’s Medical University (KGMU) had a narrow escape on Saturday when a fraudster tried to withdraw Rs 2.60 crore from its account via same modus operandi. The fraud attempt came to light when bank officials called KGMU administration to ask whether the cheque was issued. KGMU’s finance officer, Mohammad Zama, said a cheque of Rs 2.60 crore was deposited in ICICI Bank for clearance on October 1. The cheque had forged signatures of KGMU’s former finance controller, Mukul Agarwal and former senior accountant R P Vyas. The serial number was cloned from a Rs 60 lakh cheque given to a private company and encashed in August. “As per policy, any cheque over one lakh rupees cannot be cashed by bank without verifying with officials. Besides, the cheque had names of former officials so bank officials grew suspicious and called. I stopped the transaction immediately,” said Zama. KGMU has now decided to stop cash and cheque payments and will make payments only via online money transfer. It has also asked Allahabad Bank and ICICI Bank to lodge FIR against the fraudster. On October 11 last year, Rs 2.5 crores had been withdrawn from KGMU account by using fake cheque. However, the amount was returned and culprit was arrested. An FIR was also lodged by KGMU against unidentified bank employees and the person who used the cheque to siphon off the money. "

The advertisement published in various newspapers on Sunday created ripples in the academic community as the post was not advertised publicly till now. “Earlier, whoever wanted to apply for post of vice-chancellor applied online and an ID was issued which was valid for a year for appointment in any state university when some post fell vacant. The application was not confined to a specific university,” said former Lucknow University Teachers’ Association (LUTA) president Prof Maulindu Mishra. A search committee used to recommend names to the governor, the chancellor of state universities“The post of vice-chancellor in state universities was never advertised. There is confusion now whether the appointment will be as per UGC guidelines or in adherence to UP State University Act 1973,” said a professor. “It is not known if a search committee will be there. Besides, appointment will be for three years or till the age of 68, whichever is earlier,” he added. In Dr Shakunatala Misra National Rehabilitation University, the vice-chancellor’s term is of five years, he said. Meanwhile, LUTA general secretary Vineet Verma said, “The Raj Bhawan has decided to appoint vice-chancellor as per UGC guidelines after LUTA wrote saying if UGC recommendations for appointment/promotion of teachers have been implemented, why rule for selection of VC should be different.” On September 25, Governor Anandiben Patel had asked government to take necessary action to implement UGC guidelines for selection of vice-chancellors. Raj Bhawan wrote to higher education department after receiving a LUTA memorandum sought her intervention in implementation of August 2018 UGC guidelines. The guidelines state that a person with at least 10 years of teaching experience as professor should be appointed as vicechancellor and recommends a ‘search committee’ comprising 3-5 experts and eminent academicians not associated with the university or its colleges.

Lucknow,"45 days on, suburbs still wallow despite Lucknow Municipal Corporation tag","LUCKNOW: Damaged roads, garbage heaps, stray cattle and dysfunctional street lights. Twelve lakh residents of Gomtinagar Extension and Jankipuram suburb were all smiles and hoped an end to all their problems when the twin areas came under the jurisdiction of the Lucknow Municipal Corporation in July. However, their happiness was short-lived as even 45 days after coming under LMC, 70% people in Gomtinagar and Jankipuram suburbs are still deprived of civic services. A TOI reality check has found that LMC is only catering to posh localities on main roads and leaving out interior areas. According to officials, LMC started providing civic services in these areas from August 26. However, it still has not been able to cover both areas fully. When TOI did a reality check, it found that the civic body is only providing services like road sweeping and garbage collection in posh localities. Residents of Gomtinagar Extension complained about damaged roads, dysfunctional street lights, garbage heaps and stray menace. Rajni Gupta a resident of Sector 5, said, “The situation is miserable. Stray animals have instilled fear among locals. My five-year-old daughter refuses to play outside as she is afraid of stray cattle.” Other residents complained about the damaged roads in their area, which makes commuting dangerous at night. Shashi Mishra, a resident of Sector 4 said, “We have lodged several complains but LMC is still in deep slumber.” The scene was no better in Jankipuram Extension. Residents complained that LMC workers don’t come to their locality for door-to-door garbage collection. Disha Malhotra, a resident, said, “They come to collect garbage only from big houses, but never visit our locality. When we ask them, they say they have not been told to cover our area.” Locals complained that the area had become a de-facto dumping ground. Kshitij Sinha, another resident, said, “We are forced to throw garbage on roads as neither the LMC sends its workers nor it has installed any dustbins.” An LMC official said, “We are hiring more workers to provide full services in both the areas. All these localities will be covered by the end of this month.” "
Lucknow,Attendants and doctors in a spat: Hospital facility hit in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: A verbal spat between senior resident doctors of RML Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) and attendants of a female patient hit the patient care services in the institute’s Emergency for sometime on Sunday night. One of the attendants was said to be a ward boy at RML hospital. It took about 45 minutes before the tempers cooled down. At 10:30pm on Sunday, a woman, who had consumed some poisonous substance, was brought to the Emergency. While the woman was being given firstaid, one of her attendants allegedly started capturing the treatment on his mobile. When senior resident doctors objected to it, a verbal spat between the two sides began. A video of the incident that came to the fore showed chaos in the emergency room. RMLIMS spokesperson Dr Vikram Singh told TOI: “Two senior residents were sent to the Emergency as part of the orientation program so that they see how things are run. “An attendant was found making a video of the woman patient while treatment was being given to her.

Lucknow,UP: Dudhwa mascot Durga back from brink with mahout Irshad’s balm,"LUCKNOW: Durga is a year old now. She likes playing football with her mahout Irshad and is the mascot of Dudhwa National Park. Exactly a year ago when Durga was brought to the national park on Navratri eve, little did Irshad and other senior officers know that little Durga would survive and take a leap to stardom. The calf was few months old when she was found orphaned in Najibabad forest division of Bijnor by foresters. Brought to Dudhwa, she was christened Durga in tune with Navratri festivities and handed over to an experienced mahout, Irshad. The duo now walk hand in trunk through the forest trails. “The first time I saw her, she was a weak little calf and her survival was in doubt. I prayed for Durga’s health while offering namaz and slowly began feeding and bathing her. After the third bath, she showed signs of recovery. Then she bathed every day and her health improved. When she started playing, her digestion got better too,” said Irshad (48), who has been a mahout at the park for 26 years now. She’s not just good at football, Durga can greet a person with a namaste, a salaam and even bestow blessings. “She can pick up things from the ground and pass it over, sit and lie down on a command too,” said Irshad. The path to recovery was no miracle. “We made several attempts to send her back to an elephant herd. But the pachyderms, as is their nature, do not take back an orphan if it has been removed from the herd due to several reasons, including poaching, attack or if the calf came in human contact,” said former director of Dudhwa National Park, Ramesh Pandey, who was the director when Durga was brought to the park. Every time Durga was left close to an elephant herd, she would return to mainland. At other times, no adult elephant would venture near her or take her back in the herd,” said Pandey, who is now chief conservator of forest and secretary of biodiversity board. After she became a pariah in the elephant kingdom, foresters decided to rear the calf at Dudhwa. “Irshad is our most experienced mahout. He reared her like a child and they spend hours together now,” he said. Initially, the calf was quarantined after dehydration and bee stings sparked off an infection scare. “We had no experience of rearing an orphaned calf so special measures had to be taken. She was fed bottled milk and slowly given porridge,” said Pandey. "

Rashtriya Parv and Utsav Samiti, an RSS-backed organisation, will take out the ‘Ram Rath Yatra’ for which it wheeled in a specially-designed chariot, having a Ram Darbar and a model of proposed Ram temple, from Ayodhya on Sunday. The yatra is scheduled to pass through 120 crossings and will cover a distance of 40km in the city. Rashtriya Parv and Utsav Samiti member, Abhishek Singh, who is also an RSS pracharak, said this is the first time such a Rath Yatra has been planned in Lucknow. “The idea is to ensure jan jagran (public awareness) in Hindu society about the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya. We are waiting for the SC judgment. If the decision comes in favour of Ram temple, then we will reach Ayodhya in large numbers for ‘Kar Sewa’. The yatra will be organised in various parts of country,” he said. The Rath Yatra is scheduled to start from Samajik Parivartan Prateek Sthal near Ambedkar memorial in Gomtinagar at around 9.30am on Tuesday. The chariot would be welcomed at 34 crossings, including the one near CM Yogi Adityanath’s official residence on Kalidas Marg, Hazratganj, Raj Bhawan, 1090 crossing, Tedhi Pulia and Polytechnic crossing. RSS leaders, including Prant Pracharak, Kaushal, and Vibhag Pracharak, Amitesh, will lead the Rath Yatra, sources said. Sources said RSS is also spreading awareness about the Ram Rath Yatra at 22 airports across the nation, including Lucknow and Varanasi, by putting up posters. "
Lucknow,"UP: How does CM know there will be good news, asks Akhilesh Yadav","LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday questioned how does CM Yogi Adityanath knows there will be “good news” and asked how he has come to know what would happen. On Saturday, Yogi had said Ram is in our breath and expect good news soon. “BJP samvidhan aur desh ke kanoon par kam bharosa karti hai. Hum samajwadi log yahan baithe hain, hamesh kaha ki joh court faisla karega hum bhi manenge aur pura desh manega, sawal ye hai ki CM ko kaise pata ki kya hone wala hai. Pura desh samvidhan aur kannon kay saath khada hai. (BJP doesn’t have faith in the Constitution and law. SP has always said it will abide by court decision but the question is how CM know what is going to happen),” said Akhilesh. “BJP ministers are a bunch of liars. During the special session on Gandhi Jayanti, they claimed projects started in SP tenure as their own. BJP once talked about swadeshi but now it is inviting foreign companies,” he said. "
Kanpur,"UP: Muslims organize ‘Kanya Pujan’, offer food, gifts to nine girls at Durga temple","KANPUR: Setting a perfect example of communal harmony, the Muslims in Jajmau area of the city, on the occasion of ‘Ashtami’, one of the most auspicious days in the nine-day long festivity of ‘Navratri’, organised the ritual of ‘Kanya Pujan’, and offered food and gifts to nine girls at the Durga temple on Sunday. The ‘Kanya Pujan’, performed on the eighth or the ninth day of ‘Navratri’, means worshipping nine ‘avatars’ of the goddess where young girls are worshipped. Anwar Husain, president, Kanpur Samaj Samiti, said, “We organized the event because we take the puja as ‘sarbajanin’, (for all). I have never felt that it is for the Hindus only.” The ‘Kanya Pujan’ event was started by us in the year 2015 and it is the purest and the highest form of ‘sadhana’, Husain further said. He added, “We are part of humanity before we are Muslims or Hindus and such kind of event only spread the message of secularism and brotherhood. This way, we will also be seeking blessings of the nine girls,” he said. Pushpendra Jaiswal, a social activist, while appreciating the gesture of the Muslim community, said, “It’s a great thought. The way our Muslim brethren offered food with their own hand to the nine girls at the Durga temple, is praiseworthy. One should take inspiration from our Muslim brothers in organizing such an event which reflects the ‘Ganga-Jamuni’ tehzeeb (culture).” “Durga Puja also reminds us of the feminine power and its significance in our culture. We should take a pledge to respect women not only during the ‘Navratri’ but every day,” said local corporators Zarina Khatoon. “We also pledged to curb female foeticide and promote girl education irrespective of their religion and caste as they belong to ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ campaign started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi”, she added.

Ghaziabad,"Woman home guard 'blackmails' Ghaziabad cop for months, booked","GHAZIABAD: A constable posted at Modinagar police station filed a complaint against a woman home guard at Sihani Gate police station for allegedly blackmailing him for the past few months. The complainant said he came in contact with the woman in September 2017, as she was also posted at the same police station. She had told the cop that she was a widow. ""Whenever she needed any monetary help, she approached me and returned the money within a short time. In 2018, she took a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh for her son's treatment, but only returned Rs 20,000 after several reminders,"" he said. In January this year, the woman invited the man to her house, where she allegedly offered him a cold drink laced with sedatives. ""As I was in a semi-conscious state, she clicked some objectionable pictures of mine, which she used to blackmail me for months,"" he alleged in his complaint. The woman allegedly forced the man to have physical relationship with her at several occasions. ""In March 2019, the woman asked me to marry her in court, despite knowing that I was already married and had three children. She took Rs 5 lakh from me to severe the relationship and used that money to buy a plot of land,"" he said.  The constable claimed that he later came to know that the woman had filed as many as four cases of rape and kidnapping against different people and would blackmail them to settle the matter for a huge sum of money. ""In total the woman owes me around Rs 6.3 lakh,"" he said. A case under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion), and 420 (cheating) of IPC was lodged against the woman at Sihani Gate police station on Saturday.

Kanpur,"None of the river Ganga polluted stretches among the top 25 dirtiest patches, CPCB finds it cleaner than other rivers","NEW DELHI: The Ganga’s water quality may not be as per desired standards along its entire course of 2,525 km but the holy river is not the dirtiest as none of its five polluted stretches falls in the list of top 25 dirtiest patches of 351 polluted river stretches noted by government studies. Analysis of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the 10 dirtiest river stretches in 2018 were found on river Vasishta (Tamil Nadu), Ghaggar (Haryana and Punjab), Bhadra (Gujarat), Mithi (Maharashtra), Sabarmati (Gujarat), Hindon (Uttar Pradesh) and Sutlej (Punjab), among others. These polluted stretches were identified on the basis of their very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) level — a key indicator of organic pollution which affects dissolved oxygen (DO) level that impacts aquatic life. The highly polluted stretches have virtually no oxygen which means no life can exist. Data from the past three CPCB reports, carrying water pollution monitoring figures on different stretches during 2002-17, shows that the number of polluted river stretches in the country increased from 121 in 2009 to 302 in 2015 and further to 351 in 2018 with more rivers coming into the monitoring regime in the past 15 years. The bulk of the increase, however, was noticed in the least polluted category in the list As far as Ganga is concerned, only one of its five polluted stretches is in the critical category where the BOD level is more than 30 mg/l. This stretch was found where Varuna river, a minor tributary, meets Ganga in Varanasi. The other polluted stretches include Haridwar-Sultanpur, Kannauj-Kanpur (UP), Buxar-Bhagalpur (Bihar) and Tribeni-Diamond Harbour (West Bengal). The increase in a number of polluted river stretches can be attributed to discharge of untreated industrial and municipal waste into rivers over the years. Data shows that over 60% of sewage generated in urban areas across the country finds its way into rivers without any treatment. The country has the capacity to treat only 23,277 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage against the generation of 61,948 MLD of sewage, leading to pollution in one or the other river in all states except Arunachal Pradesh. Other north-eastern states, however, are not that lucky. Along with Assam, which figured at the second spot after Maharashtra in terms of a high number of polluted river stretches in 2015 and 2018, the entire north-east saw a substantial jump in the number of such stretches. The number of polluted stretches in the north-east increased from 14 in 2009 to 60 in 2015 and further to 85 in 2018. Data shows that the highest number of polluted rivers stretches has consistently been reported on rivers in Maharashtra while ranks of other states varied in the 2009, 2015 and 2018 reports. The 2009 report took monitoring data of the 2002-08 period while the second one assessed 2009-12 data and the third one analysed 2016-17 figures. Though the central government has a scheme, National River Conservation Plan, to supplement the efforts of states for abatement of river pollution, its impact doesn’t seem to be as wide as what the Centre has been doing for Ganga in terms of scale and financial allocation. Polluted stretches of only 34 rivers in 77 towns, spread over 16 states, have so far been covered under the NRCP at a cost of over Rs 5,870 crore. The Centre’s Ganga rejuvenation programme, on the other hand, got much higher support with a budget outlay of Rs 20,000 crore for the 2015-2020 period. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Sex racket busted after raids on 3 spas,"GHAZIABAD: As many as 19 people, including 10 women, were arrested from three spas in a commercial plaza in Indirapuram on Saturday for allegedly being involved in a sex racket. Police said the spa owners are on the run. Police had received a tip-off regarding prostitution in three spas located at Raj Hans Plaza and sent decoy customers around 10pm on Saturday. “The three spas — Zannat, Maple 1 and Maple 2 — are located on the second and third floors of Raj Hans Plaza. Once we confirmed that a sex racket was active in the spas, police teams conducted a raid and arrested the men and women present there. A total of 10 women and nine men have been arrested,” said Deepak Sharma, SHO of Indirapuram police station. “One of the arrested women is the manager of Maple 1 spa, while some of the men are employees of the spas who lured customers,” the SHO added. All of them were booked under sections 3 (keeping a brothel or allowing premises to be used as a brothel), 5 (procuring, inducing or taking person for the sake of prostitution), 7 (prostitution in public places) and 8 (seducing or soliciting for prostitution) of the Immoral Trafficking (Preventoin) Act (ITPA) at Indirapuram police station. They were sent to jail on Sunday after being produced at a local court, Sharma said. Police recovered a huge stash of cash, 24 mobile phones, condoms and contraceptive pills, rate cards and customer records from the three spas. Customers were lured through SMSes and WhatsApp messages, police said. The owners of the raided spas are on the run. In another such raid, as many as 10 people, including the owner and four women, were arrested for allegedly running a sex racket in a spa in Raj Nagar on September 27. Police had received several complaints that a sex racket was being run in Vanity Spa. A policeman was sent as a decoy customer to the spa, and a deal for Rs 2000 had been stuck, following which police raided the spa. "
Ghaziabad,"IAF showcases the troika: Chinook, Apache, Tejas","GHAZIABAD: The newly inducted Chinook heavy lift helicopters and Apache attack helicopters were showcased for the first time on Sunday at a full rehearsal for the 87th Air Force Day celebrations at the Hindon airbase on October 8. Chinook heavy lift helicopters kicked off the flypast in a batch of three at the rehearsal, which showcased 67 aircraft and helicopters. “It is for the first time that the IAF is showcasing Chinook helicopters, inducted into the air force in March this year,” an IAF official said. “The advanced multi-mission CH 47F(I) will provide an edge to the IAF in operations for disaster relief, medical evacuation, search and rescue and aircraft recovery … The all-weather chopper is equipped with state-of-the-art night vision goggles will allow operations at night,” the official added. The dual rotor helicopters, acquired with customisations to suit the wide range of Indian terrain, will boost operational capabilities in high altitudes like the Himalayas. Armed forces of 19 countries deploy the Chinook, which can carry heavy cargo (like road construction material, heavy machinery, artillery guns or light armoured vehicles) over difficult terrain. Next in line was the Apache attack helicopter, flying past the parade ground in a batch of three. The Apache AH-64E (I) is the latest entrant in the IAF arsenal, inducted at the Pathankot air base last month. It is the most advanced Apache variant, also flown by the US Army. “It can shoot fire-and-forget anti-tank guided missiles, and is equipped with air-to-air missiles, rockets and other ammunition. It is also endowed with early warning capabilities,” the official said. The show-stealer, however, was the indigenous light combat aircraft Tejas, which flew past the parade ground at a speed of Mach 1.6 (or 1,975 km per hour). The Tejas, in which Union home minister Rajnath Singh recently undertook a sortie, is a single-engine multi-role supersonic fighter aircraft. The 75-ton heavy lift cargo aircraft, C-17 Globe Master, flanked by two Sukhoi-30s, followed with a deafening sound. Other fighter planes that the parade showcased were the Jaguar, MiG-21 and the Mirage 2000 (used by the IAF in the Balakot strike). Moving on from fire power, manoeuvre capabilities of the Sarang helicopters came next. Six Sarang HAL Dhruvs performed thrilling aerobatic manoeuvres, criss-crossing the skies and veering dangerously close to each other before zooming off. In the final maneouvre, the Sarang display team drew a heart in the sky with a trail of white smoke.

Lucknow,UP to supply 24x7 power till Diwali,"LUCKNOW: More than two years after BJP charged the then Akhilesh Yadav-led SP regime with minority appeasement by providing uninterrupted power supply during Ramzan while not doing the same during Hindu festivals, the Yogi Adityanath government on Monday announced round-the-clock power for the state from Dussehra till Diwali. During his whirlwind campaign in UP before the 2017 assembly elections, PM Modi had accused the SP regime of placating minorities. ""That is not the case anymore. We are providing 24x7 supply not only during Ramzan, but also during Hindu festivals of Navaratri and Diwali,'' Uttar Pradesh power minister Srikant Sharma said on Monday. The move comes ahead of the crucial bypolls to 11 seats later this month. Sharma said UP Power Corporation Limited has made an additional arrangement of 4,000MW daily, mainly from energy exchange, to meet the demand, which is expected to touch around 20,000MW in the festive season. Currently, power demand is around 16,000MW, with the state government providing 24-hour supply to cities and 18 hours to villages. ""On Diwali, the demand is expected to be around 20,000MW for which arrangements have been made,"" he said. Significantly, the demand witnessed a dip this month due to fall in day temperature and humidity. During the holy month of Ramzan between May and June this year, UPPCL provided uninterrupted power in minority-dominated pockets. "
Lucknow,"In a first, Tejas water comes in biodegradable plastic bottles","LUCKNOW: Tejas Express, India's first ""private"" train that made its inaugural commercial run on Saturday, has notched up another first by serving passengers packaged drinking water in biodegradable bottles. At least 1,500 such biodegradable bottles manufactured in-house by IRCTC at its Nangloi plant are being distributed on board the Delhi-Lucknow-Delhi train each day, officials said. The larger plan is to set up plants in different parts of the country so that packaged drinking water is served or sold only in biodegradable plastic bottles across the railway network, sources said. Compared to a normal plastic bottle, the biodegradable version costs around 15 paise extra to make. After disposal, it is estimated that a biodegradable bottle will decompose in about 12 months.  Ashwini Srivastava, IRCTC's chief regional manager in Lucknow, said ""trials"" were conducted at the Indian Institute of Packaging in Mumbai before the authorities decided to use biodegradable bottles on board the Tejas Express.

Lucknow,"In first, biodegradable water bottles served in Tejas Express","LUCKNOW: In another first, giving a fillip to environment conservation, Tejas Express is serving ‘biodegradable’ packaged drinking water bottles to its passengers. At least 1,500 bottles are being served on Tejas Express every day in both up and down trips. The bottles would be in use for a few months to observe the results and check how much do they actually decompose. “The bottles would be disposed of as prescribed,” said chief regional manager (CRM), IRCTC, Lucknow region, Ashwini Srivastava. These are being manufactured by IRCTC at its Mumbai bottling plant on a trial basis. It’s the first time that IRCTC, a central public sector enterprise under ministry of railways, has taken an eco-friendly measure by using degradable bottles. Each bottle is costing 15paise extra in manufacturing, compared to ordinary plastic bottles being predominantly used. Packaged drinking water is packed in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottle, which is non-biodegradable. As per IRCTC, in India approximately 10 lakh metric tons of PET bottles are consumed in packaging water, soft drink, juice and others. IRCTC conducted a trial to make PET bottle biodegradable by adding a biodegradable polymer to the compound. The physical and chemical properties of biodegradable polymers allow them to decompose completely when exposed to aerobic or anaerobic process or microorganisms. The biodegradable bottle is manufactured as a preform at the bottling plant and then it is blown as a bottle at another plant. The bottles have been tested at Indian Institute of Packaging, Mumbai, and testing authorities noticed that biodegradation did occur when the bottles were disposed of under high-solid anaerobic digestion conditions.

Lucknow,Ajay Kumar Lallu is UP Congress president,"LUCKNOW: Five months after the Lok Sabha poll drubbing, Congress churned its party machinery in UP by appointing Ajay Kumar Lallu as UP Congress Committee president, replacing Raj Babbar who quit soon after the elections. The team has also been whittled down to just 67 office-bearers from an unwieldy 500, leaving a clear imprint of party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi. The restructuring has taken place just two weeks ahead of bypolls to 11 seats in UP, but it will be too early to judge whether the gamble will pay off. The changes also come at a time when the party is at its lowest ebb in UP, having bagged just one seat in 2019 Lok Sabha polls and is wracked by a rebellion from key members. While the Congress propped up young faces and moved old warhorses like Pramod Tiwari, PL Punia and RPN Singh to a new advisory council, the appointment of new party entrants to august posts has triggered heartburn. The unrest hovers around the inclusion of Rakesh Sachan, who till recently was with Samajwadi Party, Dhirendra Singh from BJP and Raj Kishore from SP, all of whom joined Congress ahead of Lok Sabha polls. The party appointed 18 members to the advisory council, created for the first time, and formed an eight-member working group on strategy and planning. The council includes former Union minister Jitin Prasada, Rajiv Shukla, Imran Masood and Pradeep Jain Aditya. Other than Lallu, who was an expected choice as he was actively handling party work, four vice-presidents have also been appointed. Virendra Chaudhary will handle the organisation in the east, Pankaj Malik in the west, Laliteshpati Tripathi will manage frontal organisations like OBC cell, kisan and mahila morchas while Deepak Kumar is in-charge of frontal organisations like Seva Dal, SC/ST and minorities. Along with 12 general secretaries, 24 secretaries have also been appointed. “This is a good committee. We were hoping that with Priyanka Gandhi taking charge, youth will be promoted and this is exactly what has been done,” said Zishan Haider, member All India Congress Committee. Aradhana Mishra, MLA from Rampur Khas, will replace Lallu as leader of UP Congress Legislative Party. “The chaos in the party could be attributed to the dissolution of committees and there was none to steer the ship. Now, there is an organisation in place, and a balanced one. If someone has an issue, they can raise it with the leadership. PCCs still have to be formed in which several others members will be accommodated,” she said. Senior leader Pramod Tiwari also welcomed the move, saying senior leaders had not been sidelined as most have found place in the advisory council and would be working closely with Priyanka Gandhi. “It is a good balance of age, region, caste and community and most importantly, it is manageable,” he said.

Lucknow,Lucknow University fraud kingpin traced to Bihar,"LUCKNOW: The mastermind who used cloned cheques to withdraw money from bank account of Lucknow University operated from Bihar, revealed owners of the six firms. They also told police that the mastermind used them as conduits and paid them commission. Police had on Saturday traced the owners of seven firms — one from Delhi and six from Bihar —against whom LU had lodged FIR for siphoning off Rs 1.9 crore from its account in a nationalised bank in the financial year 2018-19 through 11 cloned cheques carrying serial numbers of those issued to it in 2000 and having forged signatures of its officials. “The owners said they were working for a man based in Bihar. As of now, it appears to be handiwork of a gang. We have several leads and our probe is on. We are trying to find out whether they have done similar fraud in other institutions also,” said Hasanganj inspector, Dhirendra Kushwaha, who is the case inquiry officer. The owners said they only got commission when money was transferred in their accounts, he said. “We have not found any insider’s role yet,” he said, while refusing to share findings further as it may hamper probe. LU has now shifted all its accounts to another nationalised bank. "
Lucknow,"Amid myriad hues of devotion, Lucknow to bid green adieu to goddess today","LUCKNOW: For the first time in city’s history, devotees are bidding an eco-friendly adieu to goddess Durga. Since Monday morning, devotees started immersing idols in artificial ponds on Gomti banks giving the much-needed relief to the river already gasping for breath due to pollution. TimesViewTuesday might go down in history as a great day for Lucknow, if all idols are immersed in artificial ponds instead of Gomti river. The way devotees came forward to immerse the idols in the artificial ponds on Monday is a good sign. Let’s hope Durga Puja committees and the district administration are able to turn the vision of an eco-friendly visarjan into a reality.At least 75 idols were immersed in ponds till evening, but the real test will be on Tuesday when over 150 Durga Puja committees will come for ‘visarjan’. Devotees coming for immersion on Monday were asked to perform rituals in 10 artificial ponds (measuring 60x60ft and 15 metres deep) – four each at Jhulelal Vatika and Kudia Ghat and two at Laxman Mela ground. The Allahabad high court had prohibited idol immersion in rivers way back in 2013 but it could not be implemented in the city due to lack of alternatives and poor enforcement by district administration. This year, however, Durga Puja committees and district administration officials have joined hands to make eco-friendly immersion a reality. Earlier, pits were dug for immersion which were not used by devotees as it did not have enough water for rituals. On the advice of puja committees, district authorities created big artificial ponds for immersions. A reality check by TOI revealed that all the devotees who came for immersion used ponds. After digging 15-metre deep for the pond, the workers laid a sheet of plastic to prevent toxic chemicals and paints used in idols seep into the ground. Lucknow Municipal Corporation has deployed two workers each at ponds to shift idols after immersion to prevent clogging. Officials said they did not face difficulty on Monday since the idols were small. Environment experts, while hailing the move, said the real challenge would be on Tuesday when over 150 idols, all about 12-15feet tall, would be immersed. President of Bengali Club Arun Banerjee said, “We will immerse idols in artificial pond at Jhulelal Vatika. I hope others will also contribute in saving river and water bodies by carrying out immersions in artificial ponds.” Tanmay Jaiswal, a devotee at Jhulelal Vatika, said: “We are happy that artificial ponds have been arranged for us. I wish the goddess will bless us for not polluting water bodies.” Shankar Verma, another devotee at Kudiya Ghat, said: “We are happy to contribute towards environment conservation. However, we feel ponds could have been cleaned as puja leftovers are still there in ponds.” "

Lucknow,UP: Government officer accuses junior of sexual abuse &amp; blackmail with lewd videos,"LUCKNOW: A 30-year-old government officer has accused a junior colleague of molesting her after spiking her food, recording her videos in inappropriate condition and blackmailing her. The incident took place in March but the woman lodged a complaint at Aliganj police station on Saturday when her morphed photograph was shared in an official WhatsApp group. In the complaint, the woman said the incident took place around Holi when the office staff had gone for field duty and she was in the office with her junior colleague. She alleged that the accused offered her snacks laced with sedative. “After consuming it, I went in the state of delirium for some time. The accused molested me and recorded a video of the act. Later, he started pressuring me to live with him or else he will circulate the video on social media,” she said. She rejected the proposal and apprised a senior officer about the blackmailing but he did not take any action. “I lost my patience when a morphed photograph showing me inappropriately with an associate of the accused was circulated in our official WhatsApp group. I thought if I don’t stop them now, they will not only exploit me but may also target other women,” she said.

Lucknow,Toddler dies mysteriously at state-run shelter home in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: A one -year-old boy at state-run orphanage, Rajkiya Bal Grih on Prag Narain Road, died under mysterious circumstances on Sunday morning. The district administration has ordered a probe into the matter and terminated the services of a nurse and a maid at the shelter home, holding them responsible for the death. This is the second death at the shelter home in two months. Earlier on August 14, an 18-month-old boy had died of dehydration. Sangeet Sharma, a member of Child Welfare Committee, Lucknow, told TOI: “CCTV camera recordings show the toddler was trying to stand by holding the cradle’s railing. In the process, he lost balance and toppled over to the ground.” “After a few minutes, the maid on night duty picked him up and put back in the cradle,” Sharma added. Next morning, when the staff on duty noticed that the boy was not responding, he was rushed to SPM Civil Hospital where he died during treatment. SHO Hazratganj Radha Raman Singh said doctors could not diagnose the problem and the cause of death. “Even the post-mortem report found congestion in lungs but no external injury marks. As the cause of death could not be ascertained, viscera has been preserved.” Sharma said though the cause of death was not known yet, it was the responsibility of the nurse and maid on night duty to examine the infant properly after he fell off the cradle. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said it was a case of negligence, hence the two staff members on night duty had been sacked. “A probe has been ordered to find out not only what happened with the boy, but also the status of the shelter home,” he added. The nurse and maid were appointed on ad hoc basis through a company. While superintendent of the shelter home Manju Verma is on leave, officiating superintendent Ritu Saran said the deceased infant and his elder sister had deficiency of blood. “On doctor’s recommendation, the child was transfused blood about a few weeks ago,” she said. The boy was brought to the shelter home on July 30 after two college girls from Munshipulia area informed the police and Childline about four kids dangerously crossing the road without any guardian. When the police team and Childline representative reached the spot, they found their father in an inebriated state on the divider. The girls (aged 6, 4 and 2 years) along with their 8-month-old brother were shifted to the shelter home. Their mother had died of some chronic disease in May this year. "
Lucknow,"Ex-armyman, aides barge into colony, assault guards in Lucknow","LUCKNOW: Panic gripped residents of a posh colony in Aashiana Sunday night when an ex-serviceman, accompanied by at least 25 people, allegedly assaulted security guards for thrashing his son over a trivial issue. Cops have arrested ex-serviceman Atul Singh and recovered a double-barrel gun and two hockey sticks. Supervisor of a private security company, Manoj Kumar Yadav, lodged an FIR at Aashiana police station against Atul Singh, two aides and 25 unidentified men for rioting, assault, criminal intimidation and insult. Cops, however, claimed when they reached the spot they found only three men and two SUVs. In the FIR, Yadav claimed that residents of the colony complained to guards at around 8.20pm about disturbance and noise created by six boys and a girl, all students of class 10, in the park located in the middle of the compound. Yadav said he found that the girl was a resident of the colony but the boys were outsiders. He asked the boys to leave the compound and escorted all of them till the gate. At around 10pm, two guards – Arvind and Alok – informed Yadav that about 25 men had entered the colony in 10 SUVs and were assaulting and abusing them. One of the guards also informed the police. “There was panic in the colony for some time after so many men entered the colony hurling abuses and threats. Thankfully, cops came on time,” said a resident who did not wish to be quoted. However, Aashiana SHO Vishwajeet Singh said when the cops reached the spot they found only two SUVs and three men. “We searched the SUVs and found two hockey sticks and a double-barrel licensed gun belonging to the ex-armyman who has been named in the FIR and later arrested. He was in an inebriated state at that time,” Singh said. “The gun and SUVs have been seized. The accused denied charges of assault and told us that the guard slapped and humiliated two boys, including his son, while forcing them to leave the colony. He said he reached the colony to talk to the guards,” the SHO said, adding that the cops were scanning CCTV cameras installed in the colony and recording the statements of both sides to ascertain the sequence of events.

Lucknow,Rajnath Singh to hold talks with French President before sortie in Rafale jet,"PARIS: Defence minister Rajnath Singh will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Tuesday and receive the first of the 36 Rafale aircraft in the French port city of Bordeaux, where he will perform 'Shastra Puja' on the occasion of Dussehra and take a sortie in the fighter jet. ""Delighted to be in France. This great nation is India's important strategic partner and our special relationship goes far beyond the realm of formal ties. My visit to France is aimed at expanding the existing strategic partnership between both the countries,"" Singh tweeted after his arrival in Paris on Monday. After his talks with Macron at the Elysee Palace in the French capital, Singh will be flown to Merignac, a suburb of the south-western French town of Bordeaux, where he will participate in the official handover ceremony for the first Rafale combat jet acquired by the Indian Air Force (IAF). The ceremony coincides with the foundation day of the Indian Air Force as well as the day when Dussehra will be celebrated. Arrangements have been made at the air base for a traditional 'Shastra Puja', or weapons' worship which forms part of Dussehra celebrations. After performing puja, Singh will take a sortie in a two-seater trainer version of the aircraft. ""Raksha Mantri will participate in the Rafale fighter aircraft handing over ceremony at Merignac along with French minister of Armed Forces Florence Parly,"" a ministry of defence spokesperson said. ""He will also perform the Shastra Puja on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami and fly a sortie in the Rafale fighter aircraft,"" the spokesperson said. Members of the top military brass of France as well as senior officials of Dassault Aviation, the makers of Rafale, will also be present at the ceremony. India had ordered 36 Rafale fighter jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016. While the formal handover ceremony takes place this week, the first batch of four Rafale jets will fly to their home base in India by May 2020. All 36 jets are expected to arrive in India by September 2022, for which the IAF has been reportedly undertaking preparations, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots. The Rafale is a twin-jet fighter aircraft able to operate from both an aircraft carrier and a shore base. The manufacturers describe it as a fully versatile aircraft which can carry out all combat aviation missions to achieve air superiority and air defence, close air support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence. The Rafale entered service with the French Navy in 2004. The Rafale jets intended for India are expected to come with certain bespoke modifications for the IAF and have been awaited as a crucial enhancement to India's Medium Multi-role Combat Aircraft fleet. The first Rafale jet will come with tail number RB 001, with RB denoting the initials of Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Bhadauria who played a key role in striking the deal for the jets in his previous role as IAF deputy chief. The handover ceremony will be followed by the annual Indo-French Defence Dialogue between Singh and French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly back in Paris on Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, the minister is scheduled to address CEOs representing leading French defence industry enterprises. As part of a wider 'Make in India' message, Singh will invite them to participate in the DefExpo to be held in Lucknow from February 5 to 8 next year. Read this story in Marathi"
Kanpur,UP: A temple where Ravan is worshipped,"KANPUR: As people across the country will burn the effigy of Ravan on Tuesday, Shivala will reverberates with chants of ‘Jai Lankesh’ and ‘Lankapati Naresh ki Jai Ho’ at its Dashanan temple praising the demon king. More than 100 years ago, local ruler Maharaja Shiv Shankar built this Dashanan temple, loctaed in the premises of Chinmastika Temple, near Kailasha Temple in Shivala area of the city. Interestingly, this temple worshipping the demon king opens only once a year on the occasion of Vijayadashami. Believed to be the ‘chowkidaar’ (guard) of Goddess Chinmastika, the five-ft idol of ‘Ravan’ is worshipped by the devotees visiting the ‘Chinmastika’ temple on Vijayadashami. The idol of Ravan is near the Shiva temple as he worshipped lord Shiva. As temple, built in 1865, opens once a year. It is believed that Dashanan-Ravan was a great worshipper of Shiva and to appease the deity he would guard the goddess. This is why Ravan’s idol was installed outside the Chinamastika temple. Several devotees gather at the temple on the occasion of Dussehra and offer special prayers to Ravan. Later in evening when the effigies of Ravan are burnt, the doors of this temple are closed till the next Dussehra. On the religious relevance of the Dashanan temple Dhani Rao, a Dalit leader claimed, “Ravan was extremely courageous, a scholar and an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva. Given the fact, that he kidnapped Sita cannot be a reason for not worshipping him. He was well versed with ‘ancient Hindu epics (Vedas) and follower of truth, thus he is worshipped every year for his good qualities.” "

Congress, while issuing the list on Monday, tried to cover up the embarrassment by saying it was an old list sent to the Election Commission before Singh was charged with indiscipline. A senior party leader said, “The list was issued on September 28 while Singh defied the party whip on October 2-3. We had sent the list of 40 campaigners to the Election Commission immediately after the bypolls were announced. Singh is yet to respond, breaching the Sunday deadline.” The party leader said Aditi Singh will be given a fair chance to explain and the list may not be changed just now. “She was given time till Sunday to respond, but since the party office in Assembly is shut till Tuesday due to Dussehra, we are expecting her to respond, if at all, by Wednesday. Only then will a decision be taken on modifying the list,” he said. Singh, an MLA from party president Sonia Gandhi’s pocket borough, Rae Bareli, was show-caused for indiscipline and anti-party activities after she attended the special 36-hour long Assembly session which the Opposition had boycotted. She had also spoken against the party’s stand on nullification of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Two leaders — former BJP MP from Bahraich Savitri Bai Phule, who joined Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, and former BSP MP from Sitapur Kaiser Jahan — have also made it to Congress’s list of campaigners for the first time.

Lucknow,"At Aishbagh Ramlila, victory over twin evils of pollution &amp; terrorism","LUCKNOW: In a first for the 600-year-old Aishbagh Ramlila, two effigies of the demon king Ravana will be put up on Dussehra on Tuesday. The effigies will symbolise two evils. One would represent Pakistan sponsored terrorism and the other pollution caused by plastic. The first effigy, which is 121-foot high, will be set on fire. But the second effigy, which is 30-foot high, is made of single use plastic and will be sent for recycling after a pledge by visitors to shun plastic. “Single-use plastic is an evil polluting the country. Aishbagh Ramlila, along with five Ramlilas of Noida, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Raipur, has been chosen by the central government for funding Ravana effigies made of plastic this year to send out a message against its use,” said president, Aishbagh Ramlila Committee, Harishchand Agarwal. “Governor Ananadiben Patel, who will be the chief guest at Dussehra function here, will destroy the two effigies. While the traditional effigy will be set afire, the plastic effigy will be felled to the ground mechanically,” said Agarwal. The traditional effigy will have the message ‘Pakistani aatankvaad ka samool nash’ (uproot Pakistan sponsored terrorism) written on it, while the other one will have appeal to stop using plastic. Effigies of Ravana’s brother Kumbhakarana (71-feet) and and his son Meghnad (61-feet) will also be burned at Aishbagh Ramlila. Six LED screens have been installed in the ground where people can watch Ravan Dahan. Over one lakh people are expected at the venue. “Last year, we ran short of chairs as thousands of people had gathered here just to have a glimpse. People even got on the roofs of their houses to watch Ravan Dahan,” said Aditya. It took 45 days for a team of 45 artists from Kolkata to make the two effigies. "

Lucknow,Lucknow: A gardener’s family finds roots in botanical gardens,"LUCKNOW: Though a holiday, Monday morning was a special one at National Botanical Research Institute. A team was eagerly awaiting the arrival of two sisters from South Africa who were on a journey to look for their roots. Annabel Percy-Lancaster and Elayne Carey Percy- Lancaster, the great granddaughters of master gardener Sydney Percy-Lancaster, were finally at the place they had been waiting to visit for years. Lancaster, a gifted horticulturist, worked at NBRI in the 1960s, developing several varieties of bougainvillea and other flowers. Though he stayed in Dehradun till his death, he had his ashes—he chose to be cremated—sent to Lucknow to be scattered in the very house he lived in as a gardener. That house now is the cactus and succulent home in NBRI. Visiting all the spots, Annabel (49) and Elayne (53) planted a sapling of Scarlet Queen bougainvillea, a variety developed by their great-grandfather.A special gift to them from NBRI was the portrait of their great grandfather made of amaranthus and celosia seeds. The portrait was created by OP Gautam, a technician at NBRI. “We are touched by the gesture and overwhelmed by the hospitality and the warmth of the people here,” said Annabel, who works at the Council of Geoscience in Pretoria. Planning a book on the family history, Annabel says her primary source of information on Lancaster was the letters he wrote to his daughter-in-law, their grandmother. Annabel also had bulletins from NBRI of the 1950-60s that Lancaster carried with himself or sent home from Lucknow. “Going back to the letters and other material I have, I will now be able to visualize the places he wrote about,” said Annabel. About their experience of Lucknow, she said, “The tour has given an insight into the life of our great grandfather. I can tell from the accounts of people who knew him that he was a humble man and a hard worker.” “People have immense respect for him even today. The honour bestowed on him is overwhelming.” said an emotional Elayne, who worked in the corporate world for 25 years before moving to a coastal town to work independently. NBRI director SK Barik, who was present with the Lancasters throughout, said, “Lancaster was a gifted horticulturist. His contribution was unique as he not only established a conservatory in NBRI but also developed several varieties. The visit of his great granddaughters is highly appreciated. We would love to maintain this relationship as it would serve as an inspiration to each of our staff members in following the footsteps of Lancaster.” "
Lucknow,"Festivals, bypolls delay international investors’ summit in UP","LUCKNOW: The festival season and the upcoming bypolls in UP have thrown the schedule for the international investors’ summit off track. The industries department had planned on holding domestic roadshows in October and December while international roadshows were to be organised in November and January. However, the plan has yet to be approved by the chief minister. An official in the industries department said that a proposal to host the international investors’ summit in February end, along with a schedule for roadshows, had been sent to the CM office last month but so far no communication had been received from there. “Dusshera holidays are going on and no official work is taking place currently. Immediately after that, BJP will be in election mode as bypolls on 11 seats are to be held on October 21 and that will be followed by Diwali. It is unlikely, therefore, that any roadshow will take place at least this month. It could also delay the summit itself because for an international event, we need time to prepare,” said an official. As per the proposal, roadshows were to be held each month starting from October. The government is targeting locations like San Francisco, UK, Germany, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and UAE for roadshows.

The artisans were seen assembling effigies of Ravan which would be set on fire on Tuesday using remote control. The tallest effigy of Ravan would be raised at the Parade ground on Tuesday morning. Interestingly, the effigies are mostly made by Muslim artisans presenting a fine example of communal harmony. A group of Muslim craftsmen who were making Ravan’s effigy at Saket Nagar ground, said that they had been making effigies of Ravan for past several years inheriting the art from their parents. “Apart from making effigies, we also attach firecrackers and place lights in eyes of the effigies to make them shine on Dusshera night. Also, different kinds of firecrackers producing light and sound will be burnt on that night”, said a craftsman working on the site. When asked what materials are used in making the effigies, he said cane and bamboo structure forms the skeleton of Ravan’s effigy. Thereafter, newspapers, glazed paper, cardboard etc are used to prepare clothes of the effigy. Paint is used for several purposes while cotton is used to make moustaches. A lot of glue is also required to paste different body parts to the skeleton, the craftsman added. The work of erecting effigies of the demons was in progress at Saket Nagar ground and H-block ground in Kidwai Nagar. At places like Parade Ramlila ground, Shastri Nagar Central Park, Lajpat Nagar ground, Lal Bangla Gujjaini etc cranes were used to make stand Ravan’s effigies which were very tall.

Ghaziabad,Abhinandan leads the men and machines that taught Pak a lesson,"NEW DELHI/GHAZIABAD: The IAF on Tuesday put the men and their flying machines that bombed on February 26 a Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) facility at Balakot and then thwarted Pakistan's counter-offensive the next day at the forefront of its 87th anniversary on Tuesday, even as Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria said the pre-dawn strikes showed India's resolve to punish perpetrators of terrorism. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was awarded the Vir Chakra for shooting down a much more advanced Pakistani F-16 before his MiG-21 was downed on February 27, led a MiG-21 Bison fighter formation at the flypast to a widely cheering crowd at the Hindon airbase.  Three Mirage-2000 fighters, flanked by two larger Sukhoi-30MKI multi-role jets, then flew the 'Avenger' formation to equally huge applause. Interestingly, the two Sukhois were piloted by Wing Commander K P Singh and Squadron Leader Parshuram, who also flew the fighters during the skirmish between the Indian and Pakistani fighters along the LoC.  This, in effect, demolished Pakistan's claim of having shot down a Sukhoi on that day. To rub it in further, the Mirage-2000s during the flypast were piloted by Group Captain Pranav Raj and Wing Commanders Pankaj Arvind Bhujade and Rahul Basoya, who were awarded the Vayu Sena Medals for successfully striking the JeM facility with Spice-2000 penetration bombs in the early hours of February 26. The IAF chief also awarded unit citations to the Srinagar-based No 51 Squadron of Wing Commander Varthaman and the Gwalior-based No 9 'Wolfpack"" Squadron of Mirage-2000s. The 601 Signal Unit of Squadron Leader Minty Aggarwal, who as a ground-based flight controller showed exceptional alertness to vector the IAF fighters scrambled to intercept the ""strike package"" of intruding Pakistani jets on February 27, also received a unit citation. Squadron Leader Aggarwal has been awarded a Yudh Seva Medal for ""distinguished services"" during wartime. The citation for the No 51 Squadron read, ""The squadron displayed exemplary courage, determination and professional acumen to ensure victory in the aerial engagement, claiming an enemy fighter aircraft in the process, the first instance since the 1971 war..."" ACM Bhadauria said, ""The strategic relevance of this (Balakot strike) is the resolve of the political leadership to punish the perpetrators of terrorism and the IAF capability to execute a strike inside Pakistan. This has been a major shift in the government's way of handling terrorist attacks."" "
Ghaziabad,Why NCR cities can’t implement EPCA curbs on diesel gensets,"Delhi has drafted a policy to compensate residents for power cuts. In the NCR cities that are its immediate neighbours, this is a distant dream; people living in housing societies in cities like Gurugram and Noida, in fact, pay an average of Rs 18 per unit for power backup. Gensets are the spare wheels that need to be deployed every day for basic daily functions in the NCR cities. Which is why, even though EPCA’s decision to ban diesel gensets on highly polluted days in NCR has the right intention, it will be practically impossible to implement. Viewed as a common national capital region, Delhi and the NCR cities share many things —airport, railway stations, metro, expressways, cabs, shopping malls, aspirations and quality of life — but not a common code on governance, resulting in many of the advantages of Delhi not extending to Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad or Sonipat. Delhi’s superior power infrastructure makes the EPCA curb on gensets implementable in the capital. But in Gurugram, there are areas in the new sectors where power lines have still not been built, though families that have got possession of their house have moved in. These societies run entirely on gensets. There are also scores of instances of developers in Gurgaon, Noida and Ghaziabad running entire residential towers on gensets after handing over flats to buyers because of their inability to procure the requisite occupation and completion papers. Life in these places, RWAs have pointed out, will come to a grinding halt should gensets not be allowed to run. “We are all concerned about environment and air pollution and do our bit in protecting the same. But in terms of the EPCA ban on gensets, I would say the government should first upgrade its power infrastructure so as to provide 24x7 power before coming out with such an order,” says NP Singh, former president of the RWA federation in Noida. The NCR cities are also big manufacturing bases; Noida of mobile phones and Gurugram of cars and two-wheelers (both cities have hundreds of other large factories as well), industries that need uninterrupted power supply through their daily cycles. “We are not happy to use generators as it increases cost of production. We use them not by choice but out of compulsion. We will be happy to pay the electricity board provided they give us 24x7 power,” says Vipin Malhan, president of the Noida Entrepreneurs Association. RWA officials have also expressed concern about another clause in the EPCA order to only allow lifts to be run using gensets on highly polluted days. Backup lines are integrated into a society’s power transmission system, which ensures gensets get activated the moment there is an outage, and delinking and relinking them will be a difficult task. “Generally, power outages last two-three hours. When there is a snag, the outages can last up to 10 hours. While I feel diesel gensets should be banned due to air pollution, it will be difficult for residents to manage since the power infrastructure is outdated,” says Sanjay Lal, vice-president of Lagoon Residents Apartments Complex Association (LARWA) in Gurugram. There are nearly 11,000 diesel gensets in Gurugram currently, according to an estimate. Till April last year, over 100 societies in Gurugram didn’t have power connections and were dependent on diesel gensets. That has significantly improved this year. Substations have been built in sectors 65, 70 and 95 and power lines have reached many more sectors. But there are still more than 30 societies that are entirely dependent on diesel gensets. Asked about the EPCA order, Noida district magistrate BN Singh said, “The EPCA order has not reached me yet. Once I get it, I will have a look it and send it to state government for necessary directives which will be implemented once received as per regulations.” Gurugram’s deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, “We will enforce the directions given in view of the poor air quality period that necessitates such measures.” The directive on banning diesel gensets under the Graded Respone Action Plan, which will come in effect from October 15, came from the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority on Monday. It was implemented in Delhi last year and has been extended to some NCR cities this time. "
Ghaziabad,"To check thefts, GPS trackers may be mandatory for new cars in Ghaziabad","GHAZIABAD: Ghaziabad police on Tuesday said that it will hold talks with car dealers in the district for making GPS trackers mandatory during the sale of vehicles. Ghaziabad is notorious for vehicle theft cases and installation of the global positioning system devices in vehicles will help cops in real-time monitoring of their movement. SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh said, “This device is not very costly and can help police in solving numerous car theft cases. We are planning to hold a meeting with car dealers before Diwali and hope that it will have a positive outcome.” Additional chief secretary Awanish Kumar Awasthi, during a recent visit to the city, said that he would request the state government to make installation of GPS trackers in four vehicles mandatory at the time of sale in cities that are part of Delhi NCR, so that cases of carjacking, which is one of the major crimes here, can be solved. This year, as many as 3,334 vehicles were stolen between January and October. Comparively, 4,341 cases were reported in 2018 in the same time period. Area-wise, the maximum number of vehicle thefts – 760 – has been reported under Indirapuram police station, followed by 575 and 478 in Kavi Nagar and Sahibabad, respectively. Meanwhile, police said the main reason for vehicle thefts is parking at unauthorised area. “There is a scarcity of parking spots in markets, offices and other public places. In such a scenario, people leave their vehicles by the roadside. A similar situation prevails in residential colonies,” said the SSP. Car dealers welcomed the latest initiative because of the benefits associated with the GPS tracker. However, they added, due to lack of awareness few customers opt for the device. Riya Gupta, spokesperson of Nexa Magic automobile showroom in Delhi-NCR, told TOI that the installation cost of GPS is around Rs 10,000 but only four customers out of 10 buy it when they are told about the benefits. “Apart from telling the location of the vehicle, the tracker, which is generally hidden in the dashboard of the car, also alerts the family members and the customer service of the car company in case of an accident,” she added. “Another benefit of the device is that you can set the distance limit for your vehicle. The owner will get an alert whenever that limit is breached. It is beneficial in case the car driver has been entrusted with the duty of picking up and dropping children from school or in case it is being towed away by traffic cops,” she further said. Ram Kumar, a dealer from Ghaziabad, said that customers give several excuses when we try to make them aware of the benefits of the gadget. Most of them think it is a waste of money. Police’s initiative might help,” he added. "
Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Man rapes woman after spiking drink,"GHAZIABAD: A man has been booked for allegedly raping a girl after intoxicating her by mixing sedatives in a soft drink at a hotel in Ghaziabad’s Lal Kuan.

As many as 20 shanties were destroyed in the fire though no casualty was reported. It took nine fire tenders to douse the flames. Sunil Kumar Singh, the chief fire officer (CFO) told TOI that as soon as the fire department received the information about the blaze, the fire tenders were rushed to the spot. “However, till the fire tenders reached the slum, the flames had reached till a junkyard that was located adjacent to the slum. It became very difficult to douse the flames,” he said. “Around 20 shanties were gutted in the fire along with the junkyard. Initial investigations have revealed that the fire broke out after a blast in ten LPG cylinders that were of 5 kg. Some of the residents were preparing dinner at the time,” Singh added. The slum is mostly inhabited by labourers from Bihar and West Bengal and most of them are rag-pickers. “Trash like plastic, wood and other materials were stored in the junkyard due to which the fire worsened,” said the CFO. Raju, a slum dweller who was present at the spot when the fire broke out said, “When I saw the fire, I rushed to my house and safely moved out with my wife and two children.” “This is the second time when a fire has broke out here in a month, but last time, only one hutment was damaged. This time huge loss has occurred,” he added. "

Lucknow,Aradhana Mishra only woman to be CLP leader in assembly,"Lucknow: Congress MLA Aradhana Mishra has become the first female leader of the legislature party, not only in the Congress, but in any party, in any state in the country. At a time when the Congress leadership is showing signs of a keen interest in the revival of the party in the state, where it had been leaderless and out of power for over 30 years, for Aradhana, it would be a major task to lead party MLAs in the Assembly and fight from the front against the Yogi government. Congress has been sharing key responsibilities with powerful faces among women leaders of the party for a long time and it was for this reason that it had elevated Rita Bahuguna Joshi as the UPCC chief. Then Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had imposed huge trust on Rita Joshi, and projected her as a party’s face in the state and outside till she decided to go with BJP. Recently, in the changed dynamics, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had, in the same manner, reposed faith in first time MLA Aditi Singh. Priyanka not only elevated her as all-India Mahila Congress general secretary, but also handed over the important Priyadarshini project to her to invite young girls and women to the party. Aditi Singh, howver, went against the party high command’s directions and joined the 36-hour-long special Assembly session and even praised the CM. Amid all this, the Congress leadership has again put its bets on a woman MLA by naming her as the CLP leader, and reposed in her the tough task of leading the party in the House in the Assembly against the state government.

The team, which had inspected around 15 tanneries on October 7 last, found two units functioning despite closure orders.

Lucknow,Congress on house-hunting spree for Priyanka’s office,"LUCKNOW: Congress workers are on a house-hunting spree for national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who has decided to set up a camp office in Lucknow. Priyanka wants the camp office because party’s political activities in the state will increase in the run up to 2022 UP Assembly elections. “Members are working overtime to provide options,” said a senior Congress leader, adding that some options have already been sent to her. “During 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Priyanka operated from Rae Bareli besides holding key meetings in New Delhi. But shuttling between the two places was both tiring and time-consuming. So, a base in Lucknow is being seen as a way out,” said a senior leader. One option is the residence of late Congress leader Sheila Kaul, who was also the sister-in-law of Jawaharlal Nehru. The house situated on Gokhale Marg is now in the possession of Kaul’s daughter Deepa and was even surveyed by the Special Protection Group, which is responsible for Priyanka’s security. During her Lucknow trip on October 2, Priyanka’s visit to Deepa Kaul’s residence had triggered rumours that she may finalise it for camp office. The other option is a house in Gomtinagar. But sources said since Priyanka’s first preference is a house close to the party office in Mall Avenue, the Kauls’ property suits her. “She wants a four-bedroom set-up with a big hall or garden or courtyard to be able to hold small internal meetings as well,” said a party leader.

Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh: Loud music, rumour of animal remains on route spur clashes","LUCKNOW: Two incidents of violence were reported in UP during Durga idol immersion on Tuesday. A clash between two communities over playing of loud music led to violence in Balrampur, injuring a dozen people under Panchperwa police station. In Basti, a rumour about animal remains lying on the route fuelled clashes in Cantonment police station area. Police claimed it to be most peaceful immersion over last five years. The state has 40,000 registered Durga Puja spots. In Panchperwa, Balrampur, around 4.30pm on Tuesday, a procession led by Akhilesh Pandey was passing through Harkhadi village, which has a dominant Muslim population. Loud music was being played. “Some people objected to the music and demanded the volume be lowered, but the troupe did not heed. As a result, residents began pelting stones,” said Panchperwa SHO Yogendra Singh Yadav. The people in troupe also hurled bricks, leading to chaos. Some villagers informed police and force arrived. The injured were rushed to district hospital. SP Balrampur Dev Ranjan Verma said an FIR on has been registered against unidentified persons on complaint of Pandey. “We are scanning the videos to nab the culprits,” said Verma. He also said that traditionally, when passing through Harkhadi village for idol immersion, the route was bifurcated—one for the idol and the other for the music and dance group. This time, the procession did not follow this pattern, leading to a clash. In Cantonment, Basti, rumours about remains of dead animals lying on the route fuelled anger. Police and district administration controlled the situation by explaining that those were just rumours.

Lucknow,3-tier accounts scrutiny failed to detect Lucknow University fraud,"LUCKNOW: While fraudsters withdrew Rs 1.9 crore in 11 transactions through fake cheques in 2018-19, the three-layered scrutiny of Lucknow University’s accounts failed to detect the scam for a year. According to rule book, “bookkeeping” is reviewed every month in which the statement of account given by the bank is tallied with the one maintained by university for the preparation of bank reconciliation statement. The practice helps in detecting any mismatch in accounts kept by the bank and the university. In case of an anomaly, bank is immediately alerted for appropriate action. The process is carried out in all government and private organisations to check frauds and scams. Further, a government-appointed auditor posted in the LU’s audit cell (local audit department) also carries out scrutiny of accounts several times in a year. Finally, a balance sheet is prepared annually before audit of accounts by a government-authorised chartered accountant or accountant general. A senior LU official, who did not wish to be quoted, said: “All the three steps – book keeping, local audit and preparation of balance sheet – could not detect fake cheque scam.” Earlier, LU vice-chancellor SP Singh had also admitted lapses in the system, which, he said, were responsible for the scam. He has formed a committee to overhaul the system and make it foolproof. LU spokesman NK Pandey said, “The university has already formed a committee to probe if there is an insider role in the case. FIR was lodged immediately and steps are on to evolve a new system to avoid recurrence of such cases.” However, LU Teachers’ Association (LUTA) is not satisfied with the steps. LUTA general secretary Vineet Verma said, “The committee formed by the vice-chancellor is to prevent recurrence of such frauds but not to identify those responsible for the scam.” Around Rs 1.9 crore was siphoned off in 2018-19 from Lucknow University’s account with a nationalised bank through forged cheques cloned from the cheque book issued 19 years ago. Irregularities were detected during an audit by accounts department of LU on October 4. An FIR was lodged against six firms on charges of fraud, forgery, breach of trust and cheating the next day. "

In a first, a troupe that regaled PM Narendra Modi, US president Donald Trump, Chinese premier Li Keqiang, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and other leaders with their rendition of ballet on Ramayana will perform during Deepotsav, slated from October 24-26. Apart from the Filipino version of the epic Ramayana, called ‘Maharadia Lawana’ meaning King Ravana, troupes from Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Nepal will also present Ramlila. “The theme for international Ramlila groups is ‘Sita’.

A production of Rama Hari, a ballet company in Philippines, ‘Sita – the Ramayana Revisited’ will depict Sita’s abduction and Lanka being set ablaze by Lord Hanuman, followed by Lord Ram and his army’s arrival in Lanka and Ravan being killed in battle. It will also show Ram doubting Sita’s and challenging her to walk on fire. Artists from Nepal will re-enact Sita’s ‘swayamvar’ with Ram breaking the bow and feature wedding songs, right from ‘jaimaal’ to ‘vidai’.

Lucknow,Lucknow: Special children of convict finally find a home,"LUCKNOW: Neha is 20, but her mental age is two. Manish is 19, but his brain hasn’t developed beyond that of a six-year-old. The siblings, who suffer from a genetic disorder, are children of a woman serving life sentence and were under threat of being rendered homeless until now. According to prison laws, children of convicts above six years of age are not allowed to stay in jail. Neha and Manish, who had been living with their mother at Nari Bandi Niketan in Lucknow since 2009, were facing eviction under these rules until the UP State Legal Services Authority took up the cudgels for them. The siblings will now stay in a special home, run by voluntary outfit Drishti Samajik Sansthan. Assessment by the chief medical officer shows that Neha has 90% brain impairment falling in the category of ‘severe mental retardation’ while Manish’s brain is 75% impaired, putting him in the ‘moderate mental retardation’ category. As the siblings are undergoing hormonal changes that come with puberty and have acute learning difficulties, it was becoming challenging to house them in a prison. Since relatives refused to step up and take them in, the authorities began scouting for a shelter to rehabilitate them. “The state legal services authority approached us with the proposal to give them a home. We readily accepted because it was important for them to live a better life outside prison premises,” said Dhiresh Bahadur, who runs Drishti Samajik Sansthan, which currently houses around 100 mentally challenged youngsters. “We could have provided only limited help within the four walls of a jail. So, their mother too has consented to the transfer,” Bahadur added. "

Lucknow,Blessing for Gomti: All 350 Durga idols immersed in 10 artificial ponds in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW : The state capital made history on Tuesday with all the 350 Durga Puja idols being immersed in artificial ponds instead of the Gomti, offering much-needed relief to the lifeline river that is already gasping for air owing to pollution. Administrative preparedness, along with enthusiastic public participation, made this unprecedented and environment-friendly feat possible in a city that often draws flak for rampant contamination of its natural resources. TimesViewCleanliness is next to godliness and the river is as sacred as the idol. People of Lucknow proved this on Tuesday. In fact, public participation was the major factor which helped Lucknow create history by going for a complete eco-friendly idol immersion this year. Pollution in Gomti has been a major concern for the past few years. Recent studies have revealed that at many stretches, dissolved oxygen levels have gone below zero. While civic guardian LMC barricaded off a 100-metre radius of Gomti and dug up 10 ponds, each measuring 3,600sqft in area and 15 metre in depth, UP Police stationed multiple watch parties near riverbanks. Durga Puja committees did their bit by making a beeline for these artificial water bodies — four each at Jhulelal Vatika and Kudia Ghat, and two at Lakshman Mela ground — for the visarjan ritual. In 2013, Allahabad high court had prohibited idol immersion in rivers, but enforcement of the order was poor over the past few years primarily due to dearth of alternative arrangements. In the past, pits dug up for immersions were not used by many because the water was not enough to complete rituals. This time, however, the authorities acted on the suggestion of Puja organisers and made the large, artificial ponds. The rest is history. “Eco-friendly immersions in the city was long overdue. The arrangements were encouraging this year and everyone followed rules,” said Arun Banerjee, the president of Bengali Club. TOI visited the three immersion points and found the arrangements eco-friendly. Police teams were allowing visarjan only after registering each Puja committee who were then allotted ponds by turns to avoid unwarranted rush at and burden on one water body. Cranes were pressed into service for idol immersion while polythene filters were spread on the surface of ponds to sieve pollutants. Civic workers remained on their toes, removing idol remains after every few immersions to prevent clogging. The remains were then buried in pits nearby and the ground levelled up using mud and bulldozers. The pollution of Gomti, which caters to 60% of the city’s water supply, has been a cause of concern for the past few years. Recent studies revealed dissolved oxygen levels below zero along many stretches of the river. Conservationists hailed the green immersion as a commendable job. Noted environmentalist professor Venkatesh Dutta said, “We have been trying to save the Gomti from toxic chemicals for many years now. This is a great beginning towards better river health.” "
Lucknow,Eye on Uttar Pradesh 2022: Big bang fight begins with bypolls,"LUCKNOW: With 11 Assembly seats going to polls in Uttar Pradesh on October 21, the byelections will set the stage for what could be the last big electoral battle ahead of the Assembly elections of 2022. With a multi-cornered contest – with the Opposition no more in a gathbandhan – in the offing with BJP, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress fighting on their own might, the bypolls will draw the contours of the future political battle. The BJP, though, is comfortable in the state and the outcome of these bypolls will not impact the party that has 312 MLAs in the 403-seatstrong Assembly, supported by Apna Dal’s six. BJP, however, is working aggressively to mop up maximum seats to keep up its winning streak, kicked off since 2014 and continued in 2017 and consolidated again in 2019. The BJP leadership will do its best to retain all nine out of 11 seats and wrest others from the Opposition camp to reiterate its invincibility. As of now, barring two — Jalalabad in Ambedkar Nagar and Rampur seats — the ruling BJP has the remaining nine its kitty. The by-elections will witness a multi-cornered contest which would work to the advantage of the BJP as was seen in the recent Hamipur byelections, where SP- BSP’s combined votes would have easily defeated the ruling party candidate. For the Samajwadi Party and its chief Akhilesh Yadav, the semi- final is a major challenge and an opportunity to bounce back on the state’s centrestage and restablish SP as a formidable force. Byelections will be a major test for BSP, Cong leadershipsThe Hamirpur byelections, in which the SP stood second, only 15,000 votes behind the winning BJP candidate, it emerged as the second choice after the BJP or first choice in the anti-BJP camp, as the BSP struggled to be far third and Congress among the also-rans. The byelections will be a major test for the BSP leadership too. The BSP has made sudden changes in favour of the Modi-led government --from supporting triple talaq Bill to abrogation of Article 370. Now, it needs to be seen how it takes on the BJP to make its presence felt. For the Congress, out of power in the state for over 30 years since 1989 and its performance on a continuous slide, the byelections could be another nightmare if it does not pull out new tricks from the old hat. The complete overhaul of the organisation, a new UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu, in place and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s keen interest in the state Congress and her decision to camp in Lucknow, may give some energy and hope to the party in the days to come.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: 9-seater plane from Pithoragarh arrives at Hindon on October 11; flights to Karnataka’s Hubballi from Gzb next month,"NEW DELHI/GHAZIABAD: A new Private airline, Star Air, will start flights between Hubballi in Karnataka and Ghaziabad in November, making it the second private carrier to launch a plane service from the new Hindon terminal that starts operations this Friday with a flight service to Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand. The Hindon air force base’s civil terminal will technically become the second airport in NCR after Delhi’s IGI when it receives a 9-seater Beechcraft plane from Pithoragarh on October 11. The Star Air service will, meanwhile, begin November 6. The airline announced it will operate a 50-seater Embraer EMB-145 aircraft every Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. It will leave Hubballi at 1.05pm and reach Hindon by 3.45pm. “It departs Hindon at 4.10pm and arrives in Hubballi by 6.50pm. Bookings opened on October 7 and the fare starts at Rs 3,699,” the airline said. Heritage Airlines, which will operate the Pithoragarh flight, said it had received a good response. “From October 11 to 26, seats on the Pithoragarh-Hindon route are fully booked while on the Hindon-Pithorgarh route so far, over 80% (of seats) are booked,” said its CEO Rohit Mathur. However, passengers will not be able to check in baggage. They can only fly with a hand bag weighing up to 7kg. Both Heritage Aviation and Star Air have the same policy of not allowing check-in baggage on their flights. While Heritage Aviation currently has only one 9-seater Beechcraft King Air 350, Star Air has two 50-seater Embraer 145. “We are permitting only hand baggage since it is a small aircraft,” said Mathur. “As of now, we don’t allow check-in baggage but may do so in future,” a spokesperson for Star Air said. Star’s website says the one hand baggage allowed up to 7kg includes a laptop, and excess hand baggage beyond 7kg will cost Rs 300 extra per kg per sector. Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) Shobha Bhardwaj said the state-run airport operator has made arrangements for passengers to check in baggage. “Security check of check-in baggage will be done by the airline. Pre-boarding security check of passengers and hand bags will be done by state police,” said Bhardwaj, who is director of the Hindon civil terminal. Unlike big airport terminals, the Central Industrial Security Force has not yet been deployed at Hindon civil terminal. CISF had sent a proposal to be deployed at this terminal but perhaps given the very low traffic volume, aviation authorities may decide on doing so when — and if — passenger numbers here justify incurring that additional cost. Heritage plans to have six flights a week. It had won bids to operate two daily flights on this sector and may do so when the second aircraft joins the fleet in a month. Half of Star Air’s seats will be sold under the government’s subsidised regional connectivity scheme (RCS), or ude desh ka aam nagrik (UDAN), fares. All seats on Heritage Aviation’s King Air will be sold at RCS rates — Rs 2,270 for Hindon-Pithoragarh and Rs 2,470 for the return flight. “Under UDAN, we get subsidy from the government. But how viable it will be, we will be in a position to say only after operating flights for some months,” said Mathur. While how Heritage and Star perform remains to be seen, the record of small operators who bagged UDAN routes since the launch of RCS scheme in April 2017 has been abysmal. Stability of RCS operations at Hindon will come when big players like Alliance Air, IndiGo or SpiceJet begin UDAN flights from here. Star Air operates flights to Bengaluru and Tirupati from Hubballi. It is the aviation arm of the Sanjay Ghodawat Group (SGG), which is present in several segments like agro, floriculture, food processing, energy, mining, realty, consumer products, textiles and education. Backed by a workforce of over 10,000 employees, the group is headquartered near Kolhapur, Maharashtra. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “Under UDAN, a total of 55 cops, which includes one deputy SP, have been trained by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security. They who will be looking after security of the airport.” (With inputs from our Bengaluru bureau)"
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Man kills wife with iron rod, kid finds body","GHAZIABAD: A man has been booked for allegedly killing his wife following an altercation by hitting her head with an iron rod in Khoda early on Wednesday morning. The woman’s body was found by one of the couple’s children, who were sleeping in another room, said police. The victim has been identified as 30-year-old Neelam. The accused, Raju Kumar, has gone missing, police said, adding that the autopsy report is awaited. Pinki, a neighbour, told TOI that the couple’s 10-year-old son (they also have a seven-year-old daughter) woke up for school on Wednesday morning and found Neelam lying in a pool of blood. “He immediately came to my house and said that his mother had received a head injury and there was blood in the room,” she said. “When I went to their house, I found that Neelam was dead and Raju was not there. Another neighbour also reached and we informed police about the incident,” Pinki told TOI. Sandeep Singh, the station house officer (SHO) of Khoda police station, said Raju works in a private company in Dubai and had returned to India two months ago for vacation. “He had initially gone to his relative’s place in Unnao. He returned to his wife’s house in Khoda on Sunday,” the police officer added. “Initial investigation revealed that the accused used to fight with his wife on a regular basis. He also wanted his wife to transfer the house in his name as he wanted to sell it. However, the woman opposed it,” Singh said. An FIR has been registered against Raju under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code. "

Kanpur,Kanpur: Youth Congress leader shot in clash between two groups,"KANPUR: A youth Congress leader was shot dead allegedly after a clash between two groups in Geater Kailash Nagar under the limits of Chakeri police station on Wednesday. The police identified the deceased as Shoaib Khan, a resident of KDA Colony, Jajmau. The incident, which took place on Wednesday afternoon, was fallout of a quarrel between Ravi Yadav and Prashant over a monetary dispute. According to police, Ravi Yadav, a resident of Greater Kailash Nagar, had hired Prashant of Jajmau as a contractor for installing a tin-shed at his under-construction house in the area. “On Wednesday afternoon, altercation had ensued between Ravi and contractor Prashant over money matter. Subsequently, Prashant apprised Youth Congress leader Shoaib about the issue, following which the latter along with his aides arrived at the spot,” said police. The matter, however, escalated when Ravi allegedly tried to hold captive Prashant’s father and later the two sides indulged into heavy brick-batting, said police. As per eyewitness, Ravi brought a licenced rifle from his house and opened fire at Shoaib. The bullet hit Shoaib’s in abdomen and he slumped to the ground. After this, Ravi ran away from the spot. Shoaib’s friends raised an alarm and he was taken to a nearby nursing home, but doctors declared him brought dead on arrival, police added. Police swung into action and arrested Ravi after laying a trap in the area. SSP Anant Deo said, “Accused Ravi has been arrested and the rifle he used in the murder of youth Congress leader Shoaib Khan has been recovered from him.” Outraged relatives and Congress party workers assembled outside the mortuary and demanded immediate arrest of the accused. The police assured them of action. SP East Rajkumar Agarwal, meanwhile, said that a case has been registered under relevant sections, including 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code against Ravi. "
Lucknow,‘Muslims should give up claim on Ayodhya land as goodwill gesture’,"LUCKNOW: A group of intellectuals under the banner of ‘Indian Muslims for Peace’ on Thursday said, majority Muslims were ready to relinquish their claim on the disputed 2.77 acre in Ayodhya to the Indian government as a “goodwill gesture”. The forum will soon submit its resolution to the Justice Kalifulla-led mediation panel. The forum, however, admitted it had no stake in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute and had not roped in any litigant in its discussions, except UP Sunni Central Waqf Board. Talking to reporters in Lucknow with former Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor, Lieutenant General (retd) Zameeruddin Shah, as chief guest, forum members said Supreme Court should give a clear verdict and Muslims should give up claim on land for sake of communal harmony. “In our collective wisdom, the disputed land owned by Muslims of India may be handed over by Supreme Court to the government of India as a goodwill gesture for peace and harmony,” read the resolution. Talking to TOI on sidelines of the presser, Lt Gen Zameeruddin Shah said, “We have no stake in the matter, but as a pressure group we hope to make Muslim litigants see sense and accept our proposal. I was not part of this group, but got involved after Sunni Waqf Board invited me.” “The SC ruling is welcome but it would be ideal if before that comes both parties can do an out of court settlement. In a clear SC ruling, no one side will be a winner,” he added. Former IAS officer Anis Ansari told reporters that “for the past one-and-half years, attempts were being made to resolve this matter through mediation. This is our last attempt to resolve the matter for sake of communal harmony. This is why the intelligentsia, including doctors, academia, lawyers, armymen, bureaucrats and journalists have come together.” “Even if the judgment is in favour of Muslims, there is no way a mosque can be built with a functional temple at the site. Forcing something will only lead to clashes and riots. This is not out of fear or surrender, but for country’s peace we are offering a solution,” said Dr Kausar Usman. While emphasizing that the government is the rightful custodian, the forum raised four riders to their proposal. These include that the status of no other Muslim or any place of worship be disturbed as of August 15, 1947. While this is already enshrined under Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act of 1991, the forum asked for the three-month punishment under the Act be extended to minimum three years and maximum to life sentence. The forum also said mosques and mausoleums protected under ASI should be opened for offering prayers. Ayodhya mosques be repaired and the criminal conspiracy case in the Babri Masjid demolition be expedited and riots accused brought to justice at the earliest. “An out-of-court settlement is not possible without participation of litigants. Majority Muslims want reconciliation and it’s better to find a way so that the secular fabric of the country remains intact,” said Ansari. ”An out of court settlement is not possible legally. But we are not talking on legal note but suggesting that there is a matter of serious communal implications so we should forget about legalities and find a lasting solution,” said Anis Ansari. "
Lucknow,"Woman shot at twice outside a food joint near Raj Bhawan, two arrested","LUCKNOW: A woman in her twenties, who had refused to chat on video call earlier this week, was shot at twice outside a restaurant at Hazratganj crossing near Raj Bhawan in the small hours of Thursday, the incident underscoring how unsafe even high-security zones of the city are. The woman escaped unhurt because she ducked in time and the bullets hit a parked car. Two of the three assailants, including the prime accused, were arrested later in the day. According to police, the victim was having dinner at a restaurant in Hazratganj on her friend’s birthday on Monday when it all began. Her friend’s boyfriend, Md Adil, made a video call to wish the birthday girl. He also wanted to say hello to her, but she sternly refused. That hurt Adil’s ego. He called again and hurled abuses at the victim who paid him back in the same coin. Past Wednesday midnight, when the woman was chatting with the owner of a popular Hazratganj food joint, Adil and his aides drove up in two sedans. He asked her to step out of restaurateur Praphulla Pandey’s SUV. She refused. Adil broke the left front door window with the butt of a countrymade pistol. One of his aides too flashed a gun. In self-defence, Pandey stepped out of his SUV with his licensed revolver. The woman followed him out. Adil and his aides retreated, but before fleeing in their cars they fired two rounds at the woman. She ducked in time and the bullets hit the SUV’s rear window. Pandey dialled UP 100 and lodged an FIR against Adil and his aides for attempt to murder. He later told TOI that the victim was his regular customer and when he saw Adil threatening to kill her, he intervened. Hazratganj circle officer Abhay Mishra said they had recovered two shells fired from a .32-bore countrymade pistol. “Adil, a resident of Aminabad, and his aide Rehan Khan, a resident of Alambagh, have been arrested. We are looking for a third accused,” he added. "
Lucknow,Nadwa uproar over transfer of faculty,"LUCKNOW: Unruly scenes were witnessed at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama on Thursday afternoon, following protests over the transfer of a faculty member to another seminary at Bulaki Adda area of Lucknow. The march was reportedly led by Maulana Salman Husaini Nadwi, who trooped into the office of Nadwa principal to protest the transfer of the faculty member Maulvi Tauheed Alam, who was handed out the order on Thursday. Later, public relations officer, Nadwa, Mohammad Faizan Nagrami Nadwi issued a statement, stating Maulana Salman Nadwi along with his son Yusuf and a group of students from outside the seminary reached the principal’s office and created ruckus.  He cited the transfer of Maulvi Alam as routine, while stating that the principal and officers of the seminary were upset with the sloganeering. The official statement from Nadwa did not cite any reason for transfer of Maulvi Alam out of Nadwa. Talking to TOI, Maulavi Alam said, “I don’t know the reason of my transfer. But, I could have been targeted for accompanying Maulana Salman Nadwi at a few of his programmes and being supportive of him. The atmosphere was being vitiated by the anti-Nadwi lobby.” Maulana Salman, who was sacked from All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) executive committee, did not respond to repeated calls from TOI. Earlier this week, Maulana Salman Husaini Nadwi was asked not teach a particular subject following complaints from students. As per the correspondence between Nadwi and the principal, the students complained that while teaching his subject — Muqaddimah Ibn al-Ṣalaḥ based on Hadith — Maulana Nadwi introduced his opinion, rather than what is held by clerics. Following this complaint, a five-member committee was formed by Nadwa and it was accepted that because Maulana Salman Nadwi was introducing certain aspects and books of the subject which were neither part of the curriculum nor approved by Nadwa, the subject was taken away from him and handed over to another faculty member.

Lucknow,UP: Even DGP’s rebuke on 11 firings failed to spur cops,"LUCKNOW: The VVIP zone shooting outside a restaurant at Hazratganj crossing, metres away from Raj Bhawan, shows police have not been able to check smuggling of countrymade firearms despite being admonished by DGP on September 24 after 10 shooting incidents, one every alternate day, took place last month. The audacious attack at a prime location under 24X7 vigil, and at a stone’s throw from Hazratganj police station, also reveals that there is still no fear of law among miscreants, exposing the tall claims by senior police officials of coming up with a mechanism which would help catch criminals and also act as a deterrent against crime. More than 25 shooting incidents, including nine over petty disputes, have taken place in the city so far this year, with 10 persons getting killed and a dozen being injured. TOI had highlighted through several reports from September 23 to September 26, how easy access to illegal firearms has led to spurt in shooting incidents and how people are pulling the trigger at the drop of the hat, besides revealing how countrymade sophisticated arms are being easily smuggled into the state from Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. After the expose, DGP O P Singh had called a meeting of district police brass and read out the riot act. SSP Lucknow, Kalanidhi Naithani, had promised to check flow of illegal firearms into the city and crack down on those selling bullets to miscreants. A special cell was also set up for the purpose, but it has not been able to make any difference barring seizing weapons of four persons who could not give account of the bullets used by them. Similarly, promise to cover all main crossings with CCTV cameras and cutting police reaction time from 10 minutes to 5 under Operation Prahar is still on paper. The announcement was made last year after a loot and murder incident outside Raj Bhawan on July 30. Last year, police had also proposed to deploy constables given commando training at main crossings to intercept criminals trying to escape, but that also failed to take off. "

Lucknow,UP bypolls: BJP scrambles atop SP-BSP debris,"LUCKNOW: A divided Opposition is likely to help the BJP as 11 assembly seats in UP are gearing up for bypolls on October 21. The recent Hamirpur bypoll has already shown how the splitting of votes helped the BJP candidate when the combined tally of SP and BSP (85,191 votes) was much higher than his 74,000 votes. Though the pre-Lok Sabha elections alliance between BSP and SP failed to deliver as expected and both the parties could win just 15 seats, their combined power came to light again in Hamirpur bypoll when they fought separately after a bitter split. A look at the candidates fielded by all parties in the upcoming byelections on 11 seats reveals that while BJP’s upper caste votes can be expected to remain largely intact, BSP and SP, having fielded candidates from the same caste on various seats, are likely to eat into each other’s votes. In Lucknow Cantt for instance, both SP and BSP have fielded Brahmin candidates. BJP candidate Suresh Tiwari is a three-time MLA from the seat and will, therefore, be a formidable opponent. However, SP is banking on the fact that not only is its opponent a Brahmin, he is also a retired Army major and from Uttarakhand, residents of which can be found in Lucknow Cantt. Similarly, both SP and BSP have fielded OBCs in Pratapgarh, against Apna Dal’s RK Pal, who is also a BJP office-bearer from the district. BSP candidate is Ranjeet Patel while SP has fielded Brajesh Patel. Where BSP argues that it released the list of candidates much before SP, a senior member from SP said it was waiting for the BJP to declare its candidates first.  “We are not contesting against BSP. It is BJP we are challenging. In Hamirpur too, BSP only hurt SP’s chances by fielding a Muslim instead of a Brahmin, which would have cut into BJP’s votes. If one looks at each seat in the bypolls, it is easy to see that BSP’s candidates are no challenge to BJP’s,” he said.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Woman shot at twice outside a food joint near Raj Bhawan, two arrested","LUCKNOW: A woman in her twenties, who had refused to chat on video call earlier this week, was shot at twice outside a restaurant at Hazratganj crossing near Raj Bhawan in the small hours of Thursday, the incident underscoring how unsafe even high-security zones of the city are. The woman escaped unhurt because she ducked in time and the bullets hit a parked car. Two of the three assailants, including the prime accused, were arrested later in the day. TimesViewPolice have cracked several shooting cases and made arrests as well but that has not been able to deter people. The reason, say, expert, is easy access to illegal firearms and lack of fear of being caught. The need of the hour is a multi-pronged strategy comprising regular patrolling, CCTV vigilance, quick arrest, swift convictions and crackdown on the illegal arms trade.According to police, the victim was having dinner at a restaurant in Hazratganj on her friend’s birthday on Monday when it all began. Her friend’s boyfriend, Md Adil, made a video call to wish the birthday girl. He also wanted to say hello to her, but she sternly refused. That hurt Adil’s ego. He called again and hurled abuses at the victim who paid him back in the same coin. Past Wednesday midnight, when the woman was chatting with the owner of a popular Hazratganj food joint, Adil and his aides drove up in two sedans. He asked her to step out of restaurateur Praphulla Pandey’s SUV. She refused. Adil broke the left front door window with the butt of a countrymade pistol. One of his aides too flashed a gun. In self-defence, Pandey stepped out of his SUV with his licensed revolver. The woman followed him out. Adil and his aides retreated, but before fleeing in their cars they fired two rounds at the woman. She ducked in time and the bullets hit the SUV’s rear window. Pandey dialled UP 100 and lodged an FIR against Adil and his aides for attempt to murder. He later told TOI that the victim was his regular customer and when he saw Adil threatening to kill her, he intervened. Hazratganj circle officer Abhay Mishra said they had recovered two shells fired from a .32-bore countrymade pistol. “Adil, a resident of Aminabad, and his aide Rehan Khan, a resident of Alambagh, have been arrested. We are looking for a third accused,” he added. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Brother-in-law slit woman’s throat, traced through Facebook","LUCKNOW: A Facebook profile, traced using a mobile phone number, helped police arrest on Thursday the man who slit a woman’s throat and left her to die on Shaheed Path on Wednesday. The critically injured victim, Seema (35), had scribbled her name, a 10-digit number and the letter ‘N’ on a piece of paper before losing consciousness in hospital. The clues led cops to her brother-in-law, Nadeem (38), who has confessed to the crime. Nadeem said they were in an extramarital relationship and she was pressuring him to leave his cancer-stricken wife. Seema, a resident of Gosainganj, was found in a puddle of blood near UP Police’s Dial 100 headquarters along Shaheed Path and rushed to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital. She was shifted to KGMU Trauma Centre early on Thursday and remains critical. Gosainganj station house officer DK Upadhyay said the 10 digits scribbled by the woman were jumbled. “Hence, when we dialled the number, it was invalid. However, we continued to shuffle the first four digits. After every permutation and combination, the number was put through a caller ID app,” the SHO said. Luckily for police, one particular combination threw up the name Nadeem. “We dialled the number, but the phone was switched off. Since the victim had scribbled the letter ‘N’ too, we used the number to trace the Facebook account of Nadeem. There, we found ‘Seema’ on his friend list. The profile picture matched that of our victim,” the officer said. Facebook photographs of Nadeem in front of a school bus helped police track down the owner of the vehicle. “The man said he had hired Nadeem as a driver. He also identified Seema as an acquaintance of Nadeem. We used electronic surveillance and nabbed Nadeem from Chinhat while he was escaping to Balrampur in a van,” Upadhyay said. Nadeem told police he owned the van. Bloodstains inside it strengthened police doubts and sustained interrogation revealed the truth. According to Nadeem, Seema left her husband three years ago and lived with her daughter. Since her sister is suffering from cancer, Nadeem and she grew close. “However, mounting pressure from Seema to divorce his wife angered Nadeem. On Wednesday, he took her out in his van on the pretext of shopping, slit her throat and dumped her thinking she was dead,” the SHO said, adding that the accused had been forwarded to jail. "
Ghaziabad,11-hour snarl after oil tanker overturns on Ghaziabad-Meerut Road,"GHAZIABAD: Traffic was on standstill on the very busy Ghaziabad-Meerut highway for more than 11 hours after an Indian Oil tanker carrying LPG turned turtle at 5.30am on Thursday. The driver of the truck going to Haridwar from Ghaziabad via Meerut with 17 tonnes of LPG gas, told police that he was feeling drowsy behind the wheel and lost control of the vehicle. Gas leaking out of the overturned tanker caused panic among the locals and passersby. When ten cranes failed to lift the vehicle, the police had to bring in Hydra machines that took seven hours to bring the tanker back on its wheels. “Police took proper precaution and asked the people living within 500 m to 1 km of the spot to stay home. We also asked people to stay away from the inflammable object to prevent any accident. An Indian oil team reached the spot and stopped the gas leak,” KP Mishra, circle officer of Modinagar told TOI. Rohit Sahu, a commuter and a resident of Kavi Nagar area told TOI that they were asked not to light a cigarette or anything that could cause a fire. While the traffic flow from Meerut to Ghaziabad was not disrupted the entire day, the situation was bad for commuters who were heading for Meerut. “Police diverted the traffic from Ghaziabad-Meerut highway to Hapur for heavy vehicles while light vehicles were diverted to Raj Nagar Extension to go Meerut. It took almost ten hours to make the situation normal as the truck was carrying LPG gas due to which we didn't want to take any risk,” he added. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Woman ends life, kin allege pressured for dowry","GHAZIABAD: A 40-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide after consuming poison at her house in Govindpuram in Kavi Nagar. The deceased woman, Reetu Goel, is survived by her husband Puneet and their two children, Mukul (14) and Arnav (9). The couple got married in 2003 in Hapur. Reetu’s family has claimed that Puneet had been demanding Rs 40 lakh from them to open a shop in Ghaziabad. They are yet to file a police complaint. Anil Shahi, the station house officer (SHO) of Kavi Nagar police station, said that around 7pm on Wednesday, Reetu and Puneet had an argument following which she took poison. Immediately afterwards, Puneet left home with some friends.  “Reetu’s elder son called his grandfather, Puneet’s father Pradeep, and informed him that she had consumed poison. Pradeep reached the spot and took Reetu to Yashoda hospital but doctors declared her dead,” he said. The SHO said that they are awaiting the results of the autopsy. Reetu’s father Raghunanda Prasad Garg told TOI that Puneet’s family informed him about the death on Thursday morning, a day after the incident. “My son-in-law runs a grocery-cum-medical shop in Kavi Nagar and he was demanding Rs 40 lakhs to open a showroom. When we didn’t agree, he started misbehaving with Reetu,” he said. The family also hit out at Puneet, saying that instead of taking Reetu to the hospital, he went to the Ganga with his friends to take a bath. “How could a husband go out when his wife was dying in front of his eyes?” asked Garg.

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad could get botanical garden, gyms for women","GHAZIABAD: A botanical garden and a women-only gym are on the agenda of the Ghaziabad mayor for an upcoming meeting, where around Rs 100 crore worth of infrastructure projects for the city are likely to be sanctioned. Officials said following the government’s order, the meeting, which is going to be held next week, will be chaired by mayor Asha Sharma instead of the divisional commissioner. Sharma said she has sought the list of proposals from the corporation officials and the meeting date will be announced soon. Apart from works related to the construction of drains and roads and other infrastructure-related projects, Sharma said she wants the corporation to develop a botanical garden and a women-only gym in the city. “At present, students from Ghaziabad schools and colleges have to visit Delhi and Noida for research purposes in the absence of such a facility here. The plan is to develop a botanical garden having a wide range of plants, and some rare ones. I spoke to developers of a park in Sohna. Around Rs 15 crore is required for developing a botanical garden on 10 acres of land. The garden will have great heritage value and a musical fountain can also be developed,” the mayor said. She suggested that the land near Mahamaya Stadium could be utilised for this purpose. As far as the women-only gym is concerned, Sharma said around 4,000 sqm of land would be required to build the facility. “The first could be started on a pilot basis and based on the result, such a facility could be developed in all five zones of the corporation. Keeping the privacy of women in mind, the facility will be a covered one and only female trainers will be employed,” she added. Meanwhile, the work of constructing the 3.5-km-long Saur Urja Marg has started in Sahibabad Industrial area where only solar energy will be used for streetlights. The mayor said the Rs 12-crore project was passed in the last infrastructure development fund meeting and will be ready in a month. Besides this, the divider will also be decorated and a drain flowing along the road will be renovated. "
Lucknow,Student injured in Lucknow University's canteen brawl,"Lucknow: A small argument over washing hands snowballed into a nasty fight at Lucknow University’s commerce department canteen on Thursday afternoon, leaving an undergraduate student with a grievous head wound caused by glass shards from a broken soft drink bottle. The proctor’s office, which along with the police has received a complaint from the injured student, is probing the incident. The named accused, also undergraduate students, are on the run. According to the complaint lodged by BA student Surat Singh, trouble began while he was washing his hands after lunch at the canteen. He said he inadvertently spilled some water on BCom final-year student Suraj Singh Pehlwaan. Although Surat “immediately apologised”, Pehlwaan pinned him to the wall and began hurling abuses. A heated exchange of words followed and before anyone could intervene, Pehlwaan and his friend — Chetan Malviya, also a BCom student — allegedly attacked Surat with a soft drink bottle. The two boys fled the scene as Surat, bleeding profusely from the head, slumped to the ground unconscious. Other students present in the canteen rushed Surat to a private hospital. On being released after treatment, the student lodged a complaint with the proctor’s office and police. “The proctor board is probing the matter. Strict action will be taken against those involved. The students who fled away are being tracked down,” said LU spokesperson NK Pandey. "
Lucknow,"Man assaults wife for giving birth to a girl, FIR registered","LUCKNOW: A 35-year-old woman was assaulted by her husband inside a hospital in Aashiana on Wednesday because she gave birth to a baby girl. An FIR has been lodged against the man. In her complaint to police, Nisha Shukla said she married Anuj Shukla of Unnao in 2012. A year later, the couple had their first daughter. Since Anuj had always wanted a son, the birth of a second girl annoyed him so much that he not just slapped Nisha in the presence of relatives, but also refused to take her home. Quoting from the complaint, Aashiana sub-inspector Saurabh Tiwari said the woman was tormented on some pretext or the other ever since she married Anuj. “In fact, the husband refused to take her to hospital when she went into labour. The woman had to call her brother who lives in Mohanlalganj. He brought her to Lucknow and got her admitted to a private hospital in Aashiana, where she gave birth to a girl on Monday,” Tiwari said. According to the FIR, Anuj came to see Nisha with some relatives three days after delivery. He taunted her for giving birth to a girl child again, slapped her a few times when she protested and refused to take her home. Nisha’s family members and hospital staff rushed to her rescue. Anuj left in a huff, declaring that Nisha was no longer welcome to his house. The sub-inspector said the husband had been booked for assault and insult. “He has been summoned to the police station for interrogation,” Tiwari added. "

Lucknow,I equate Lucknow with good food and warm people: Aparshakti Khurana,"Having received fame in just three years in Bollywood, actor Aparshakti Khurana has made a name for himself in the industry already. The 31-year-old actor, who started his career as a radio jockey and later became an anchor on television, made a successful switch to films with the 2016 blockbuster Dangal, featuring Aamir Khan and newcomers Fatima Sana Shaikh, Zaira Wasim and Sanya Malhotra. Aparshakti, who was in Lucknow till recently, shooting for a film, confessed to being a fan of food, especially Lucknow ka khana. ""Even otherwise iss Khurana ko bas achha khana de do,"" he insists saying we should only talk to him about food, before adding, ""You know, when we were shooting in Chanderi for Stree, Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi and I, we were staying at a small guest house because wahan koi bada hotel nahi hai. So Pankaj ji, Rajkummar, Abhishek, Amar Kaushik, our director and I entered the kitchen together, as we all love food so much, and I made besan ki barfi and chicken curry for everyone. Sabne bahot relish kiya. In fact Pankaj ji is also an amazing cook and he used to prepare mutton curry for all of us."" Aparshakti and Akriti when she visited him in Lucknow while he was shooting for the film here (BCCL) Aparshakti and Akriti when she visited him in Lucknow while he was shooting for the film here (BCCL) The Dangal actor has visited Lucknow a number of times spoke at length about the city of Nawabs. ""I equate Lucknow with good food and warm people. Also, the food that this city offers is just phenomenal right from the biryani to the Tundey kebabs to the chaat to everything else. It’s really important for people to have that mentality of feeding, ki aao khilaayen aapko. Jab tak woh nahi hota chahe jitna marzi accha taste ho, mazaa nahi aata khaane mein. And that is something I find very humbling in this city, the hospitality of its people. People in Lucknow are full of that mentality, of feeding and mehmaan nawazi. That’s how I connect with this city, the vibe is just great. Another place that I’d like to mention is a popular chaat in Lalbagh area, that’s like home to me now and Jain uncle is like family. They welcome me in a manner wherein I feel main unhi ka beta hoon aur woh meri hi dukan hai. I go there very, very often, in fact I took my parents and my wife Akriti also there when they came here."" He further adds, ""Normally five-star hotels don’t have food as good food or as yummy or rustic as these street places or special places like Dastarkhwan, Tundey, Shukla Chaat, Idrees Biryani, but yahan sabka khaana equally acchha hai. Believe me, I’ve tried all,"" says the actor, who also shopped for chikan kurtas for family members and himself. Aparshakti, in the film 'Pati Patni Aur Woh', stars alongside Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday and plays a UP version of Asrani in the remake. ""I’m playing the Lakhnawi version of Asrani sahib in the film. This guy is a total nawab and rides a motorbike and I had blast playing this character on screen. Maine motorcycle chalayi and believe me, just sitting on that bike gives you that tashan. Woh kehte hain na Lucknow ki bhaukali! I experienced just that,"" says the actor with a laugh. An avid sportsperson, Aparshakti reveals that he’s not too much of a gym guy but believes in keeping fit, and that’s why he prefers activities such as swimming, dancing, playing football etc. While in Lucknow too, the actor practiced his skills in football and played several games with boys at a local school. ""I’ve always been a sportsperson. When I was offered this opportunity to play football with school kids, I was overjoyed. Right from the football field to the team, everything was amazing. Keeping in mind how young the kids are, they played really well. I played with them a couple of times. In fact, back in Mumbai, we have a football club with Abhishek Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor and more people. We play regular matches with other clubs. It’s great fun and such a good way of keeping oneself physically fit,"" says the Luka Chhupi actor. Often being asked questions about comparisons with elder brother Ayushmann and the pressure after he (Ayushmann) has won the National Award, Aparshakti says, ""I don’t pay heed to any comparisons. Also, had there been any pressure on me I wouldn’t be acting nor would I be so happy and jumpy all the time. Aur agar pressure hota bhi toh lead film ka hota, I wouldn’t be playing second leads so happily. Pressure mere liye hai when people only talk to me about Dangal whereas I have done several films after that. That makes me unhappy. Then I feel that I haven’t done anything in these four years of my life where as there was a Stree, there was a Luka Chhupi and then there was also a song Kudiye Ni for which I again shot in Lucknow."" He goes on to add, ""All I feel is happiness for how well my brother is doing. His career graph is going well and I feel happy for him. As for being bothered, I feel claustrophobic when people keep discussing one movie for too long. It makes me feel like I’m not growing in life. Pressure bas yeh hota hai ki last film se better karo, aur better karo, if at all there’s any pressure."" He adds, ""I have seen Ayushmann bhaiya’s life, he barely has any time. Plus, I’m not even in the phase where I won’t be able to find some time for myself. It’s a very caught up life for him. I’m happy for him and will always be. Also comparisons will come in if we were doing similar roles. He’s in a different league and I’m in a different one.""

""Akriti is just as busy I am. The age bracket that we are in, I think it’s the right time for us to concentrate on our careers rather than ki kab bachche paida karein, kab saath mein rahein. We both are totally focused on our careers right now. She’s doing so well in her work that I won’t want her to give that up and she feels the same for me. So for us, it’s quality time that we spend together instead of just quantity. Yeh sab insecurities tab hoti hain jab aap dono mein se koi ek kuchh nahi kar raha ho. Akriti has her own identity and doesn’t have time to think ki mera husband nahi hai mere saath, shaadi kyun kari maine. It’s all going well for us because we’ve been able to crack a good balance. Akriti’s work requires a certain amount of creative sensibility and so does mine so we can both talk to each other about our work and exchange notes about our respective works. Plus the kind of space we are in in this country right now, I think sometimes we need to make a woman read the script. Because a woman will approach the script from her own or a woman’s perspective which is very important in these times."" — with inputs by Yashi Agarwal "

Lucknow,CBI doesn't charge Sengar with murder in Unnao rape survivor accident case,"NEW DELHI: The   accident involving the Unnao rape survivor   was not a planned act but an accident caused by rash and negligent driving by the truck driver, CBI's probe into the case has found.  After carrying out extensive investigation of around two months, which was monitored by the Supreme Court, CBI on Friday filed a charge sheet in the case but dropped murder and attempted murder charges against Unnao MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.  However, Sengar, his brother Manoj and Arun Singh, son-in-law of a UP minister, have been charged with issuing threats and hatching a conspiracy against the rape survivor unrelated to the accident. He is in jail for the alleged rape of the Unnao survivor. Unnao rape survivor kidnapped, raped for 9 days by 3 people at different places: CBI to court The truck driver, Arun Kumar Pal, has been charged under IPC Sections 304A (causing death due to negligence or rash driving), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 279 (rash drivi-ng). The survivor's two aunts were killed in the accident.  The first two sections attract a punishment of two years while the third provides for six months' jail. CBI carried out several forensic tests, including simulation test at the accident site. The incide-nt was recreated and all possible angles were probed. Call details and possible connection of the truck driver with Sengar and his associates were scanned as well. However, Sengar's role was not found in the case, said a source. Finally, Sengar was charged under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 506-2 (threat to cause death or grievous hurt). These sections attract imprisonment of up to seven years or fine or both. A speeding truck with an obscured number plate had collided near Rae Bareli with the car in which the survivor was travelling with her relatives and lawyer on July 28. While her aunts died, the survivor and her lawyer were severely injured. They were first admitted to a hospital in Lucknow and then shifted to AIIMS in Delhi on the directives of the SC. The driver was later arrested. Subsequently, the survivor's uncle, lodged in a UP jail, filed a case of murder and attempt to murder with the state police. On the family's insistence, the state transferred the probe to CBI.  CBI had also booked Sengar and others on murder and attempted murder charges and formed a special probe team. SC gave CBI a probe deadline, which was extended twice. Last month, the survivor was discharged from hospital and CBI took her statement. "
Lucknow,KK Muhammad was never part of BB Lal's Ayodhya excavation team: AMU prof,"The following letter was sent to TOI by professor Syed Ali Rizvi, chairman, department of history, Aligarh Muslim University, in response to an interview 'There is no doubt that a temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu existed below Babri Masjid' that appeared in TOI on October 5 : KK Muhammad claims that he participated in the excavations conducted at Ayodhya by BB Lal. He also adds that he was ""the only Muslim member"" of the team which excavated under BB Lal at Ayodhya. The fact is that he was NEVER a part of BB Lal's excavation team! Don't believe me, check the reports filed by BB Lal himself and published in the Archaeological Survey of India Annual Reports. His name occurs nowhere!  And how could it? The excavations were carried out in 1976-77, 1977-78, and 1978-79. As per a CV uploaded by Muhammad on the AMU website, Muhammad completed his Masters course in 1975 and did a diploma in archaeology in 1976-77 from the School of Archaeology, Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi. In 1978, as per his personal file available in the department (and recently accessed by me as chairman) he was appointed as research assistant, a post on which he was confirmed in 1979. He served at the archaeology section of the department of history first as research assistant and then subsequently as assistant archaeologist till 1988 when he ultimately joined the Archaeological Survey of India.  So when and how was he involved in the Ayodhya excavations led by BB Lal? The only possibility-if he ever visited the site when it was being excavated-was as a diploma student for two or three days, as is the usual practice. If ever, he was taken on a site visit by his teachers as part of the diploma programme of the Institute of Archaeology. Thus, he was never part of the team excavating Ayodhya led by BB Lal, what to talk of being the only Muslim member of the team.  In case he is speaking the truth in this case, then probably he is not speaking the truth in his CV that he was doing a diploma at Delhi. His file at Aligarh testifies to his constant presence there from 1978 onwards. His MA degree is of 1976.  It is also factually incorrect that BB Lal discovered ""pillars"" or ""pillar-bases"" during the course of his excavations. All ASIAR reports are silent on this aspect. Not a word!  Yes, there were black basalt stone pillars with carvings fixed within the mosque but they could belong to any structure - not necessarily in situ.  Muhammad says Lal did not find any Buddhist remains. Maybe. But Cunningham, during his explorations in this area (and subsequent 2003 court-ordered ASI excavations) did reveal Buddhist remains. When in the summer of 2003 the ASI team led by BR Mani exposed a Buddhist stupa in a trench below the Babri Masjid, I was present at the site as a court appointed observer. It also finds mention in the ASI report submitted to the Lucknow Bench of the high court.  I am not going to deal with other blatant inaccuracies in the interview. For what actually was found below, please see the EPW essay of Jaya Menon and Supriya Verma. Please do google it and read! I will just point out one last thing: Yes, a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey was conducted. Muhammad says:  ""It found that there were several structures below the ground. Many anomalies were reported. Anomalies meaning that you will be getting structures below the Babri Masjid.""  A ground penetrating survey (GPR) can show obstructions in the ground, but they could be big stones. They could be structures. But whether the structure was a dwelling (found even by BB Lal earlier) or a mosque (see EPW paper cited above) or a temple, as claimed in the concluding para of the ASI report of 2003, can never be determined by this GPR.  I don't know what the SC will conclude, but remember one thing - the ASI report in its entirety is silent on the question of a temple, except in one line in the conclusion. Secondly, the type of pillar bases claimed in the report are defined as rough, weak and incapable of supporting a big structure when they were found earlier during Delhi excavations by the same BR Mani who excavated Ayodhya in 2003. ‘Excavated material doesn’t support view there was temple beneath mosque’The following are excerpts from a letter to TOI by DN Jha, former professor and chair, department of history, Delhi University: Apropos the interview of KK Muhammed, who has mentioned my name, I would like to point out misleading statements by him and set the record straight. First of all, the historians (including me) who visited Ayodhya were not led by Professor Romila Thapar but by Professor RS Sharma. The group did not consist only of Left historians; one of them, Professor Athar Ali, was definitely not a Leftist. Those of us who went there were only historians, neither Leftists nor Rightists, but rationalists concerned with the preservation of a heritage structure. They were also independent of the government and the two contending parties. Mr Muhammed speaks of two excavations at Ayodhya and says that he was a member of the excavating team of the second. But in all, there were four excavations, by Alexander Cunninham in 1861, in 1969 by AK Narain (BHU) assisted by TN Roy and Purushottam Singh, and a third by BB Lal in the 1970s. It was in this excavation that Muhammed claims to have participated; his participation, however, is unlikely in view of the fact that he was serving at AMU at that time. (The fourth was conducted in 2003 at the behest of the Allahabad high court). Mr Muhammed refers to several architectural fragments as proof of a temple beneath the mosque. But most of these were found in the debris lying on the surface and do not constitute valid evidence; it could have been brought to the site by anybody. Mr Muhammed refers to a 12th century donative inscription to prop his temple thesis. But he does not refer to its reading by the chief epigraphist of the Govt of India, Dr K V Ramesh, who submitted to the Allahabad high court that it does not mention the birthplace of Rama but of the valour of the donor's family. In short the excavated material at Ayodhya does not support the view that there was a temple beneath the mosque. "
Lucknow,Gorakhpur prison clash: Trigger was bad food or police torture?,"GORAKHPUR/LUCKNOW: Anarchy prevailed at Gorakhpur district jail after inmates clashed with the jailor, his deputy and prison wardens and smashed CCTV cameras and chairs following a dispute on Friday morning. The situation was brought under control after senior district officials reached the site with heavy reinforcement of police and provincial armed constabulary.While the state prison department claimed the incident was a fallout of an assault on two inmates by a circle officer, who visited the jail on Thursday evening, district officials claimed the trigger was bad quality of food served in jail. When sparks flew in prison premises around 10 am, jail officials swiftly send an SOS to the district administration seeking reinforcements to douse the unrest. Soon, ADM (City) Rakesh Kumar Srivastava along with Circle Officer (City), with police and PAC back-up rushed to Gorakhpur district jail. By then, inmates had roughed up the jailor, his deputy and other guards. Later speaking to reporters, ADM City said an inmate complained about bad food while another group junked the claim, triggering clashes. District Magistrate, Gorakhpur, Vijyendra Pandiyan, said prisoners want better food, including milk and eggs. They also complained of police excesses during interrogation before being transported to jail. ‘Inmates sought regular hearings in court’“Inmates also sought regular hearings in court. A magistrate will visit the jail every day to look into their demands,” said senior superintendent of police, Gorakhpur, Sunil Kumar Gupta.

Jailer Prem Sagar Shukla and deputy jailer Prabhakant were roughed up. Jail inmates have written to the district administration seeking action against circle officer (city) Praveen Singh for thrashing them on Thursday evening. "
Lucknow,Fatal leap by drunk man over flyway gap in Lucknow,"LUCKNOW: A 29-year-old man fell 25ft to his death from a flyover, when he tried to cross from one ramp to the other, separated by a few feet, at Vibhuti Khand in Gomtinagar in the small hours of Friday. While police claim Deepak Singh — a shop employee and Aliganj resident — was in an inebriated state and met with the accident, his family has accused a friend who was with him of murder. No FIR has been lodged yet. The flyover, rising from Lohia Crossing on Lohia Path, splits into two after a few metres. One ramp connects with Polytechnic Crossing and the other with IGP Crossing. This was the fourth death at the flyover in 2019. In two accidents in March and August, three persons died after their two-wheelers rammed the guard rail and they were flung off the flyover. Vibhuti Khand SHO Rajeev Dwivedi said the incident took place around 12.30am. “The gap between the two ramps is 3-4ft and Deepak was too drunk. He lost balance and fell 25ft onto the road below. His friend Ashish Mishra, who was also drunk, informed us. We rushed him to RML hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” the SHO said. Quoting Ashish, an Aliganj resident, the officer said the youths were on their way home from 1090 Crossing and were supposed to take the route via Polytechnic Crossing. But, Ashish wanted to go on a long drive and took the IGP ramp. Deepak stopped him, got down and tried to jump to the other ramp. The victim’s family has accused Ashish of pushing Deepak off the flyover after a fight. “However, no one has lodged a complaint,” the SHO added. "
Lucknow,Act if Lucknow University staff not helping in scam probe: VC writes to DGP,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow University vice-chancellor on Friday wrote to the state police chief requesting him to direct local police to provide to the university a list of employees not cooperating in the investigation.

Ghaziabad,Pithoragarh hills are much closer to the national capital region now,"PITHORAGARH/ GHAZIABAD: Ereena Hussain got emotional when the King Air 350 landed in Pithoragarh on a crisp, sunny Friday afternoon with the first passengers to fly from NCR to the hill town. The King Air, the first commercial plane to fly from the newly built civil terminal of the Hindon air force airbase in Ghaziabad - technically, NCR's second airport after Delhi's IGI - departed around 1.40pm for Naini Saini airport. Though small, it was a packed flight: all nine seats in the 9-seater aircraft were taken. The journey took less than an hour, instead of the 16-18-hour ride by road it had always been. But Ereena's joy wasn't just about reaching her home in the hills so quickly. ""My father was in the construction business and had laid this airport's runway in the late 1990s. There were no flights at that time and I learnt driving on this runway and would ride my cycle here. And today, I have landed here on a flight from Delhi,"" Ereena, a fashion designer, said. Each of the nine seats on the King Air operated by Heritage Aviation is priced under Rs 2,500 (one-way) as Hindon-Pithoragarh is an UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) flight under the subsidised regional connectivity scheme (RCS). The plane was flown by Capt Anoop. Gunjan Sinha, a Delhi resident who had wanted to visit Patal Bhuvaneshwar temple in Pithoragarh for a long time but couldn't because she has motion sickness and going by road was the only option, was happy that she would fulfil her dream. ""The drive on hilly terrain is an unpleasant experience for me as it causes nausea. I had put my plans to visit Pithoragarh on hold for years,"" said Sinha, who was travelling alone. ""Driving a car or hiring a cab from Delhi to Pithoragarh and back costs much more than flying here for a per person return fare of under Rs 5,000. The time saved and inconvenience of 17-18-hour drive avoided is priceless,"" said O P Kharbanda, also a Delhi resident, who was travelling with three family members.  To see off the first batch of passengers, a host of dignitaries had gathered at Hindon terminal, including Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and Union minister Gen VK Singh (retd), the Ghaziabad MP. Airline staffers ushered all passengers once the display board flashed the flight number, 4H105, and announced security checks were open. ""The Hindon terminal has eight check-in counters, four security frisking booths and four X-ray machines. ""It has a parking bay which can accommodate 90 cars,"" said Shobha Bhardwaj, director of the terminal. Security is being managed by UP Police. Just half an hour before this, another group of nine people who the King Air flew from Pithoragarh to Hindon, had made history as the first passengers to land at Hindon. Among them was 10-year-old Josh, who was accompanied by his father. ""I enjoyed the flight,"" Josh said approvingly. The inaugural plane landed 15 minutes late, around 1.15pm instead of the scheduled 12.30 because it took off late (at 12.25pm instead of the scheduled 11.30pm). "
Ghaziabad,Saving Sai Upvan: BJP councillor threatens contempt plea against Ghaziabad civic chief,"GHAZIABAD: A BJP councillor has threatened to file a contempt petition against the Ghaziabad municipal commissioner for allegedly not taking steps to safeguard Sai Upvan, the 200-acre forest in Ghaziabad, as per the 2012 order of the Allahabad high court. He has already sent a notice to GMC chief Dinesh Chandra. Rajendra Tyagi told TOI that he had filed a PIL in the Allahabad HC in 2012 to save Sai Upvan which once had over thousands of trees. Consequently, the court, on October 11, 2012, had directed the civic authorities to cement the canal flowing through the green area so that sewage water does not overflow and destroy the greenery. The high court had also directed that a sewage treatment plant (STP) be constructed so that the water of the Hindon river is not polluted. “Despite the strict order, no steps have been taken so far. It amounts to violation of the court’s order. I have no option left but to file a contempt case against the GMC commissioner. I had written a letter with a similar intent to the GMC is 2013, but senior officials never took cognizance of the order,” he said. Tyagi said before he filed the PIL, another petition was filed by a city resident over the conservation Sai Upvan and Kanha Upvan, also a city forest area. “The HC had ordered that no other activity will be allowed other than those related to spreading greenery. But the officials are not following this order as well and handed over 4000 sq m of land for building a powerhouse for the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System project,” he alleged. When contacted, GMC commissioner Dinesh Chandra said, “The RRTS is a central government project and it cannot be stalled. As far as the construction of drain and STP is concerned, I will study the order and initiate suitable action.” Over the allegation of decay of plants and trees in Sai Upvan, a three-member committee was constituted last month by the GMC to investigate the matter.

SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said the trio had been identified as mastermind Dilip Kumar (48), a driver who sold marijuana on the sly, and contract killers Rajiv Ranjan (21) and Adarsh Kumar (24).  Victim Deepak Verma (36), who ran a food stall in the area and supplied tiffin to cops, was shot dead on September 21, barely 100 metre from the police station.  According to the SSP, Deepak had begun selling marijuana from his stall too and wanted to partner with Dilip for better profits. He had allegedly been pestering Dilip to give him a cut money of Rs 20,000 every month or else threatened to inform police. Instead of cowering under the threats, Dilip hired shooters for Rs 50,000 and also gave them a countrymade pistol, the SSP said. The mastermind and killers were identified by an 'X' mark on the fuel tank of the bike used in the crime, which was caught on CCTV camera. The bike was seen parked outside Dilip's house.

Lucknow,"Dengue sting gets sharper, claims third victim in UP","LUCKNOW: Dengue fever, which has been stalking the state since January, claimed its first victim in the city on Friday. Aman Chandpuri(22), a BEd student and a poet by passion, is the third dengue victim in the state. Earlier, the vector-borne disease claimed two people in Unnao and Barabanki. Chief medical superintendent Dr Amit Agarwal said Aman was admitted to Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) on October 3. “The patient was in shock syndrome, the last stage of dengue, when he came to us. His blood pressure and platelet count were very low. His condition kept deteriorating and he did not respond to treatment,” Agarwal added. Broadly speaking, dengue has three stages. First, a person suffers from high temperature. Second, the fever enters a haemorrhagic stage when rashes appear on the body and there is possibility of internal bleeding. And third is dengue shock syndrome, which leads to circulatory collapse and multiorgan failure. A native of Ambedkarnagar, Aman who lived in Daliganj area of Lucknow to pursue his studies had once penned the lines, “ Mitti se yeh tan bana, Mitti bahut ameer, Mitti hona ek din, Sabka yeh sharir(The human body will one day disintegrate into the soil)”. His family and friends obviously never imagined that he would embrace “the ultimate truth” so early. Youngest among three siblings, Aman was an emerging icon in the field of Hindi poetry. He had performed on many platforms across the state and had also written short stories, besides couplets. On September 28, he left for his hometown with high fever. Doctors in Ambedkarnagar diagnosed him with dengue. “His platelet count had dropped to 8,000 and he was referred to KGMU Trauma Centre (in Lucknow). Owing to unavailability of beds, we had to admit him to a private hospital in Indiranagar,” said father Sunil Singh, a teacher by profession. The bereaved father alleged that the private hospital extorted money in the name of treatment. “My son was there for five days and despite spending Rs 2 lakh, his condition did not improve. We had to take him to SGPGIMS,” Singh said. “Unfortunately, it was too late by then,” he added. "
Lucknow,Amausi bomb scare holds up Chennai flight for four hours,"LUCKNOW: A flight to Chennai taxiing for takeoff from Amausi airport came to a screeching halt on the tarmac after a bomb alert to the pilot from air traffic control (ATC) on Saturday evening. Passengers went into a tizzy and panic gripped the airport as bomb disposal squads swung into action. For four hours, stranded flyers were on edge of their seats before security agencies termed it a hoax. After the ATC green signal, the flight scheduled for 7:25 pm, finally took off 30 minutes to midnight. The bomb scare followed an alleged tipoff to CISF at the airport gate by a Delhi-bound passenger about explosives in the cargo of the Chennai-bound flight. Sanjay K Narayan, officer on special duty, Airport Authority of India, said, ""A passenger, Piyush Verma, came to board the Delhi-bound 6E447 IndiGo flight, scheduled to take off at 10.40 pm. After the security check at Gate No. 5, CISF personnel observed Piyush moving suspiciously. When they asked Verma about his unusual behaviour, he told the jawans he knew about a bomb inside the Chennai-bound 6E518 IndiGo flight."" CISF swiftly alerted the airport director, CISF senior commandant, bomb detection and disposal team, quick reaction team and dog squads. The ATC was alerted and the pilot asked to slam the brakes, said Narayan. Hoax caller is mentally challenged, say policeBomb squads scanned the plane and thoroughly scoured the airport premises for explosives till late night. AK Sharma, director, Amausi Airport said, “Anti-sabotage measures were put in place in the entire airport, but information given by the Delhi-bound passenger turned out to be false. He’s mentally challenged and was handed over to police. The flight took off safely with all passengers after clearance by bomb detection teams.” Circle Officer, Krishnanagar, Amit Rai, said, “Hoax caller Piyush Verma is a resident of Lakhimpur and came Lucknow to visit his relatives. When grilled on his source of information about a bomb in the flight, he panicked and began crying. When we repeated the questions, he fell silent and behaved insanely. “ “Later, we contacted his family and asked them about his antecedents. His family said, Verma was mentally disturbed and they didn’t know how he reached Lucknow. The youth also failed to clarify why he was going to Delhi. His family is now being questioned,” he added.

Lucknow,3 arrests expose ‘filmi’ forgery of 11 Lucknow University cheques,"LUCKNOW: The arrest of three persons in connection with the Lucknow University cheque forgery case has revealed that the Rs 1.9-crore con is deep-rooted in three states and was pulled off with precision a la American biographical crime film Catch Me If You Can. The only difference is that against one con artist, Frank Abagnale (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film), who switched at least eight identies to siphon off millions, police here have had to trail six dubious firms and more than half a dozen dodgy men. The two prime accused are still at large. ASP Sonam Kumar said Sushil Yadav who has an electrical firm in Delhi, Ronit Gupta who owns a pharma company in Patna, Bihar, and taxi driver Amrendra Kumar were arrested on Saturday. They have been charged with forgery, cheating and breach of trust. The hunt is on for masterminds Pankaj Jain and Manas who cloned as many as 11 cheques, issued by a nationalised bank and used up by LU in 2001, to make the fraudulent transfers with forged signatures in 2018-19. The university had lodged an FIR on October 4 after an internal audit detected the unauthorised money transfers to the current accounts of six firms — one based in Delhi and five in Bihar. Sushil’s firm withdrew over Rs 49 lakh through five forged cheques between April and July last year while Ronit’s company received around Rs 20 lakh using two cheques between November 2018 and January 2019. The other four withdrew up to Rs 10 lakh each. Police tracked down Sushil and Ronit using addresses given to banks while opening accounts. The others were not found at the given addresses. ASP Kumar said prime accused Pankaj and Manas got hold of the 2001 LU chequebook details either through aides in the varsity or at the bank. They got fake cheques printed with the same numbers, entered amounts and forged the signature of LU finance officer. Pankaj ‘borrowed’ the bank account of Sushil, who needed money for his daughter’s wedding, for a 10% cut, the ASP said. Similarly, Manas used Patna cabbie Amrendra to contact and convince five businessmen in Bihar to possibly ‘rent out’ their accounts to encash the forged cheques. For playing middleman, Amrendra got a 10% cut too. Hasanganj SHO Dhirendra Pratap Kushwaha said Ronit after his arrest led them to the taxi driver who in turn spilled the beans on the whole modus operandi. "

Members of the board passed a resolution stating that ""far from protecting rights of Muslim women and children in marriage, the law will destroy marriages and render the Muslim women destitute"". While the working committee expressed optimism about a favourable judgment by Supreme Court on the Ayodhya title suit, the members also deliberated on Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and called the concept a ""threat to diversity."" ""The board will oppose any attempt to destroy the nation's fabric through court or legislative measures. We will launch protests in a democratic and peaceful way. Not only will uniform code affect Muslims, but also the cultural and social rights of tribals and other religious minorities,"" the board members said. AIMPLB hopeful of favourable verdict in Ayodhya title suitTerming the attempt to introduce a uniform civil code as anti-national, the resolution stated that central or provincial courts should abstain from taking up any such plea. These resolutions were passed at the working committee meeting of AIMPLB at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulema, Lucknow. On the Ayodhya case, the board was hopeful the apex court will pronounce a “judgment in favour of the Muslim cause, which will be based on right, fair play and justice”. It reiterated its stand that the land dedicated to a mosque cannot be altered, changed or transferred in any manner as it’s prohibited under Sharia. The board meeting which was presided over by Maulana Rabey Hasani Nadwi, clarified that while no Muslim can surrender or transfer waqf land, the stance of Muslims is based on historical facts and evidence that Babri Masjid was constructed without demolishing any temple or place of worship. “There were several attempts to resolve the Ayodhya case through mediation and AIMPLB was part of the discussions. But dialogue didn’t yield result,” the resolution stated. With legal proceedings in final stage, the mediation window is closed, the board said. The members said the Ayodhya dispute is a test case for basic values of secularism enshrined in the Constitution. “The apex court judgment will be in consonance with the rule of law and basic tenet of the Constitution,” the board said.

Reacting to Raza's remarks, senior AIMPLB member Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahali said the Ayodhya land dispute is being fought in the Supreme Court, and not against a person or any organisation. ""Those raising such questions should know that there is a Constitution and law in the country, and they should be aware about it. The AIMPLB has been formed under the Societies Registration Act, and is a registered organisation,"" he said. Without taking Raza's name, Mahali said, ""He should know that those who are in the AIMPLB, their ancestors had sacrificed everything for the country's freedom. The board has never worked against the country. The board is working while remaining within the ambit of the Constitution."" "

The health department on Saturday announced that house owners and in-charge of government and private properties will be booked under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for endangering public safety if the larvae of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue, is found in their premises for the second time in its inspection. If mosquitoes are found breeding in water and garbage accumulated on a vacant property, monetary fine will be slapped on the owners, said officials. The decision was taken at a meeting of health department, Lucknow Municipal Corporation, Lucknow Development Authority and education officials to curb the dengue menace surge in city. Lucknow divisional commissioner Mukesh Kumar Meshram chaired the meeting. On Saturday, TOI had highlighted how steps taken by health department and civic agencies are insufficient in tackling dengue which has claimed a life and infected over 470 persons in the city since January. District vector-borne disease control unit in-charge Dr K P Tripathi said health teams will survey houses and offices, both government and private, in city to check mosquito breeding. The teams sanitise the place where larvae are found. A second inspection is done as follow up to ensure the place is clean. “We often found people did not take adequate steps and conditions conducive to mosquito breeding were created agai. Now, if larvae are second in second inspection, an FIR will be lodged,” he said. Vacant plot flooded with water and garbage were found to be breeding mosquitoes. LDA has been asked to fine owners of plots where such conditions are found. LMC will take action against illegal dairies breeding mosquitoes because of accumulation of water and filth. LDA chief engineer Indu Shekhar Singh said, “A fine of Rs 3,000 will be imposed on plot owners not taking adequate steps. Fine can be increased depending on the size of plot.” It was also decided to carry out awareness drive on dengue in schools, malls and Lucknow Metro. "

The busiest stretches of Sadar are riddled with potholes and absence of street lights increases the risk factor manifold after sundown. Complaints to public representatives in the past have only met with hollow promises. “The condition of roads has remained unchanged for three years. Two-wheeler riders frequently injure themselves while dodging potholes,” said Vibhu Sinha, a resident. Alambagh, SingarnagarThe business hub of Alambagh has battered roads. “Besides accidents, dust pollution is also a concern,” said resident Rajesh Singh. Roads in Sringarnagar, on the other hand, have never been repaired in five years. Potholes have yawned into craters, posing serious threat to life and limbs of commuters. Corporators and MLAs have done precious little to amend the situation, say residents. Aashiana &amp; LDA ColonyJal Sansthan dug up many roads in the area to lay sewer pipes, but these were never properly levelled. The ride is always bumpy and accidents are frequent. Chhavi Agarwal, a resident of Sector M in Aashiana, said both e-rickshaws and auto-rickshaws refused to ferry passengers to the area.

Lucknow,"Shararas to ghararas, khadi sets ramp afire","LUCKNOW: When Mahatma Gandhi said, “Khadi stands for simplicity... It can be made as it was in the days of yore”, he perhaps never thought that the world would one day see his ‘livery of freedom’ in haute couture with contemporary cuts and trending silhouettes. From pastel dresses, chinos, ghararas to bright shararas and kurtas, besides custom-made Nehru jackets, models flaunted the traditional handwoven fabric in myriad avatars to set the ramp on fire. The unique fashion show on Saturday — a tribute by Indian designers on the 150th birth anniversary year of Gandhi — was part of the 10-day Khadi Mahotsav organised by UP Khadi Board. Designers visibly walked the extra mile to showcase khadi in umpteen styles, the primary objective being bringing the fabric home as daily wear. Celebrating the rustic charm of khadi was Ritu Beri whose models walked the ramp amid drum beats and Rajasthani folk music. Budding designers of NIFT Rae Bareli, on the other hand, put forward fusion wear with contemporary cuts. The red-and-gold wedding trousseau collection — Shadi with Khadi — by city designer Asma Husain won laurels no less. “So many leading designers have taken up the fashion challenge to turn khadi into high-fashion wear. This new-age representation as a modern yet quintessentially Indian textile has made khadi very appealing to the millennials,” said Gaurav Khanna, a student of NIFT Delhi. The show saw designs by Rina Dhaka, Ritu Beri, Runa Banerjee and Rupika Chaturvedi, among others. The audience applauded the special mention of local artists at the beginning of every designer’s segment. “Be it printed, embroidered, hand spun or jacquard — local artists breathe life into every fabric,”said Purvi Joshi who attended the show.

The casualty dealt a severe blow to the continued efforts of breeding lions in captivity to shore up their numbers with as many as 12 big cats dying at the safari. Etawah Lion Safari director, Vinod Krishna Singh, said Tauqeer had arrived with six other lions from Junagarh Zoo, Gujarat, on September 23. ""Tauqeer's intake was poor since arrival.

This was after TOI reported that Tyagi’s personal security officers had abused a group of residents of Grand Omaxe society in Noida’s Sector 93B, an fracas that was captured in a video clip. The video shows security personnel of the national executive member of BJP’s Kisan Morcha arguing with residents of Grand Omaxe society over alleged illegal construction being carried out in the park and common area by the politician.

In case, the inquiry finds it was the case, it will be recommended that the security cover be withdrawn,” he said, adding that he also spoke with Noida Authority about the issue.

Ghaziabad,Pollution board recommends Rs 90 lakh fine on NHAI,"GHAZIABAD: The state pollution control board has recommended that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) imposes a penalty of over Rs 90 lakh on the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for not adhering to green norms to contain dust pollution on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. “During our recent survey on the entire DME (NH9)and the Dasna-Meerut stretch, we noticed many spots where loose soil was kept in the open resulting in dust pollution,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). “In a recent meeting with Environment Pollution Control Authority chairman Bhure Lal, the NHAI and other agencies were asked to take measures to control dust pollution but that was obviously not happening, as a result of which we had to recommend environment compensation on NHAI to the tune of Rs 90.23 lakh,” he said. The recommendation comes in the backdrop of the EPCA chairman’s recent visit to Hapur where he himself was witness to dust pollution along DME. The NHAI was penalised last year as well for not taking appropriate steps to control dust from its ongoing project and a fine of Rs 2.50 lakh was imposed on it. The district magistrate of Ghaziabad and UPPCB have been issuing directions from time to time to agencies and departments to adhere to green norms for containing pollution. “Sprinkling of water on dust emanating patches, covering of construction material being handled on site and providing dust breaking screens are necessary for controlling pollution,” Sharma said. “In addition to NHAI, two industries — Ved Cellulose situated on Hapur Road and RAC Paper Limited in Modinagar — were found to be using banned fuel in industries during inspection carried out by our team. The two industries have been imposed a fine of Rs 26 lakh and Rs 24.,75 lakh,” said Sharma. "

Lucknow,"‘Jab bhi Lucknow mein shoot karta hoon, mera dil khush ho jaata hai!’","Abhishek.Shukla2@timesgroup.com Actor Govind Namdev, of Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana fame, was in the city recently to shoot for the film Kashi To Kashmir. Hailing from the interiors of Madhya Pradesh, the Bandit Queen actor, who has been a regular visitor to the city since he came here in 1984 for the first time to act in the NSD repertoire play Tughlaq, found this trip a nostalgic one as he took a tonga ride near Rumi Darwaza. Reminiscing his childhood, an elated Namdev says, “I have a very strong connection with horses. This tonga ride took me down memory lane when I was 7-8 years old. There used to live a tangawala at our house in Sagar (Madhya Pradesh) as a tenant and he used to take me for horse rides in the morning. They were really fun! I still remember the face of that tangawala.” Ask the Satya actor how has the city changed since he first came to Lucknow in 1984 and he replies, “Lucknow has changed a lot since then. Today’s generation believes more in modernization but earlier, woh kehte hai na pehle aap, pehle aap aur Lucknow ke andaaz alag hote hain, woh logon mein dikhte bhi thay. The response I got for my play here at that time, was very rare and wonderful. Now the younger generation not only focuses on its culture and heritage, but it also wants to do something creative to match the pace of today’s lifestyle. Things change every decade so we should not compare it with the past.” But looking at the Rumi Darwaza, he couldn’t resist lauding the technology of the past, “Look at this masterpiece, can you imagine at that time what technology they would have used to make such a fine architecture which stands tall till today after centuries of wear and tear? It’s amazing! So, I think the younger generation should also appreciate such things of the past which passed the test of time.” Govind Namdev riding a Tonga at Rumi Darwaza in old Lucknow (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Govind Namdev riding a Tonga at Rumi Darwaza in old Lucknow (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Being his fifth film here, the Singham Returns actor shares the experience of shooting in Lucknow, “There is positivity here! The scene I conceive here has an altogether different thought process which reflects in my acting. Jab bhi Lucknow mein shoot karta hoon, mera dil khush ho jaata hai!” According to the Virasat actor, it is due to this positivity and solace he finds here that he started writing a play in Lucknow itself. Sharing the update on that play, Namdev says, “I always wanted to write something about Bundelkhand culture and history. I have completed that play and it is titled Madhukar Shah based on a freedom fighter from Bundelkhand who had raised a voice of rebellion against the British Rule much before the Revolt of 1857. The play was unveiled earlier this year by megastar Amitabh Bachchan.” Talking about how the theatre scenario in the city has changed over a period of time, the veteran actor has also plans of opening a drama school in his home state in the near future, “The theatre scene not only in the city but across the country has been vibrant in the past few years. The reason is not only that theatre is a stepping stone to films and TV but also the advent of so many other platforms like web series among others. So, I think is it is a good sign for theatre. After getting relieved of all my family responsibilities, may be in the next 3-4 years, I would like to open a drama school in my home state Madhya Pradesh,” shares Namdev. Talking about his upcoming films, the Sarfarosh actor shares, “I have two Bollywood films lined this month, first is Officer Arjun Singh IPS directed by Arshad Siddiqui, which is based on politics and was entirely shot in Prayagraj, and the second film is Junction Varanasi, where I am playing a hardcore villain. I also have completed one Hollywood movie titled The Gandhi Murder which is waiting for its release in India. I have played the character of Morarji Desai in the film.” "
Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh reels under inventory of Rs 1,43,000 crore unsold housing units","LUCKNOW: The realty sector is reeling under a burgeoning inventory of unsold housing units in Uttar Pradesh valued at over Rs 1,43,000 crore, but the state government is clueless on how to tide over the crisis. Since three years, the real estate sector is facing an unprecedented slowdown after witnessing a boom for years. Unsold housing units continue to stack up in both government and private sector housing and have become a cause of concern. Unperturbed and unmindful of the swelling inventory of unsold dwelling units, government housing agencies keep announcing new schemes, without thinking of ways to dispose of pending houses. As many as 9,500 housing units of Uttar Pradesh Housing and Development Board, with an estimated worth of over Rs 9,000 crore, are lying unsold. Besides, various development authorities across the state have over 20,000 unsold houses with an estimated cost of Rs 10,000 crore. he Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), an umbrella body of private sector realtors, told TOI there are 21,000 and 1,82,000 unsold houses costing over Rs 10,600 crore and 1,14,000 crore in Lucknow and NCR region (including some parts out of UP also), respectively. ‘Govt agencies can’t cut cost of housing units to boost sales’When contacted, principal secretary, housing, Deepak Kumar, said unsold dwelling units of the board and development authorities was a cause of concern. He said unlike private sector, the government agencies cannot reduce the cost of units to sell them. The government has its limitations and constraints, but policies would be worked out soon to sell unsold properties and ensure revenue and returns from the investment in them. Kumar said the development authorities in state have a stock of about 20,000 unsold properties. A former commissioner of Uttar Pradesh Housing and Development Board told TOI on condition of anonymity that the sale and investment in real estate sector may have suffered after demonetisation and is yet to recover from it.

Lucknow,"Monsoon exits Lucknow, 22% surplus rain second highest in 10 years","LUCKNOW: The southwest monsoon withdrew from the city last week on a 22% surplus note, which is the second highest rainfall recorded here in the past 10 years. Between June 1 and September 30, the capital received 856.7mm rainfall against a normal 704.4mm. Lucknow’s score was better than the overall monsoon rainfall in the state that ended in 9% deficit. Experts said the rainfall pattern in Lucknow this time was good for recharge of groundwater, which has been depleting at a high rate of one metre every year. Instead of short duration downpour, the city witnessed light to moderate rainfall over days in the three major spells recorded this year. Such a pattern, state Met director JP Gupta said, helped boost the water table. In case of heavy rain, excess water flows into the river. But, when it rains with light or moderate intensity over a longer period of time, the water can percolate through soil and rocks to reach natural underground reserves, he said. Monsoon arrived late in the city this year. Against a normal date of June 18, the southwest currents flowed in on July 3. Three major spells of rainfall — July 5-13, August 23-30 and September 25-30 — were responsible for the above average score. During the rest of the period, the city witnessed scattered and intermittent rain. While the total city rainfall recorded in June was just 15.2mm (83% below normal), July witnessed 377mm, August 185.5mm and September 279mm. Lucknow had been blessed with similar largesse by the rain god in 2018, when the surplus score was 25%. In 2011 and 2012, the city received normal rainfall. In other years during the past decade, rainfall was below normal. In 2008, the city though had witnessed 52% surplus rain. "

Lucknow,Jaipur duo swapped real items with fake to rob e-shop of Rs 2 crore,"LUCKNOW: Two graduates from Jaipur, one of them a BTech and an aspiring actor, cheated an e-commerce giant of over Rs 2 crore over a period of two years by swapping original products with duplicates before return until luck ran out on them in Lucknow on Sunday. Sohit Soni (26) and Rahul Singh Rathore (24) were arrested from Alambagh after security staff of the e-commerce company grew suspicious over the use of one credit card for purchases by 150 different IDs with separate names and addresses across the country, including UP and Delhi. Also, all these IDs returned the items bought, saying the same were defective. A thorough probe revealed that phone numbers were also common in case of some of the IDs while recent purchases were made from Lucknow, an employee of the e-commerce website, Shashank Singh, told TOI. The company then lodged an FIR with police who raided a rented house in Alambagh to nab the two youths. Seven mobiles phones, 29 SIM cards, 1,514 forged labels of different products of branded companies and 20 packets of protein powder were found. Police said the duo hailed from Jaipur, Rajsthan, but shifted base every two to three months to avoid suspicion. Sohit has a BTech degree while Rahul is an ITI graduate. The former has told police he played a cameo in a Hollywood film shot in Rajasthan, and was seeking a break in Indian movies and TV serials. Hazratganj circle officer Abhay Kumar Mishra said the youths purchased expensive products, replaced them and, if needed, changed labels before return. For instance, imported protein powder worth around Rs 9,000 was swapped with wheat flour or local protein powder. Thereafter, they sold the original product to gyms. The ingenious scheme had worked flawlessly for them since 2017. ""So far, we have detected fraud worth over Rs 2 crore. The items they replaced mostly included protein powders and electronic goods like smart watches and wireless earphones. They have operated out of Delhi, Bihar, Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand, besides UP and Rajasthan,"" Mishra added. "

The matter came to light when mayor Sanyukta Bhatia went on a surprise inspection on Friday. TOI visited both parks on Saturday. The one that underwent the unexpected facelift flaunted manicured lawns, freshly painted benches and a new boundary. In contrast, the original project site was buried in garbage and construction debris while a broken wall barely passed muster as boundary.

Lucknow,"BJP gears up to breach SP and BSP forts in Rampur, Jalalpur","LUCKNOW: Seven days to go for crucial bypolls in 11 assembly seats and BJP has its task cut out to not only retain nine seats, but also wrest Jalalpur and Rampur, both strongholds of BSP and SP respectively.  The Jalalpur seat will be a test case for BJP, which seeks to make inroads into Mayawati's vote-bank in the aftermath of the broken SP-BSP marriage. Likewise, BJP is striving hard to wrest Rampur, a district with the largest Muslim population in the state, at a time when its MP and senior SP leader Azam Khan is embroiled in corruption with 81 cases slapped on him and his family. BJP sources said, the party has roped in BSP turncoat and UP minister Brijesh Pathak to ascertain the Dalit dynamics in Jalalpur to breach Mayawati's fort. The BJP, party sources said, has also been wooing another Brahmin strongman, Pawan Pandey, elder brother of former BSP MP Rakesh Pandey, whose son Ritesh was MLA of Jalalpur before he got elected to the Lok Sabha in the recently concluded elections. This is seen as BJP's bid to consolidate Brahmin voters even as it fielded a Thakur, Rajesh Singh, son of former SP MLA Sher Bahadur Singh. Rajesh will be up against BSP's Chhaya Verma, daughter of BSP's legislative party leader Lalji Verma, Samajwadi Party's Subhash Rai and Congress' Sunil Mishra. In the high-voltage election in Azam Khan's pocket borough Rampur, BJP has roped in another BSP turncoat and cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya to turn around Mayawati's cadre and be buoyed by a split Muslim vote. Here, BJP has fielded Bharat Bhushan Gupta, who hails from the trader community, who contested on a BSP ticket against Azam in 2012, but lost. He joined BJP just before 2017 elections. Barring BJP, all others in the fray, including SP, BSP and Congress have fielded Muslim candidates. While SP has fielded Tazeen Fatima, wife of Azam, BSP has placed its bet on Zubair Masood Khan and Congress too has fielded a Muslim, Arshad Ali Khan. ""We would not only win the nine seats which were with us, but also Jalalpur and Rampur,"" said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, who reached Rampur on Thursday to take stock of poll preparations. He also held meetings with booth and sector level functionaries to mobilize them to take on the Opposition. "

Lucknow,CM Yogi Adityanath asks farmers not to burn crop residue in fields,"LUCKNOW: With stubble burning season upon the state which leads to an immediate spike in air pollution levels during winter, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has appealed to farmers to not burn stubble in fields this year. “Due to stubble burning, animals do not get their rightful share of fodder and the practice also kills friendly bacteria and fungi present in abundance in the soil. This practice permanently damages the environment and fertility of the soil,” the CM said while addressing a workshop on National Clean Air Programme on Monday. Stubble burning is a common problem encountered in states like Punjab, Haryana and UP from October onwards which contributes to a sharp increase in levels of toxic particulate matter in the air. Yogi also announced that the government would be setting up river management centres at nine locations to monitor water pollution. These centres, to be managed by the UP Pollution Control Board, will be set up at Agra to monitor the Yamuna, at Ghaziabad for Hindon, Jhansi for Betwa, Gorakhpur for Ghagara, Rapti and Aami, Moradabad for Ram Ganga, Meerut for Kali, Lucknow for Gomti and Sai rivers, Ayodhya for Tamsa and Saryu and at Varanasi for the Ganga and Varuna rivers. Talking about ways in which to control pollution, the CM said techniques which would convert stubble into organic fertilizer should be promoted to discourage its burning. “Concerned departments must spread awareness among the farmers regarding the issue,” he said, adding that if nature is exploited excessively, people will fall prey to the “wrath of nature”. He said: “This is the reason that environmental pollution has emerged as a serious global problem. Love for nature and use of technology can help overcome this serious issue.” Banning single use plastic in the country, the CM said, was a move in this direction, adding that effective planning was required to control pollution.

Lucknow,Lucknow: 2 fall to death after hitting deathtrap flyover railing,"LUCKNOW: Two persons died and one was injured after falling from the 25-ft high flyover opposite Picup building in Vibhuti Khand of Gomtinagar in the early hours of Monday. The trio was tripling on a bike without helmets, police said. The bike hit the flyover’s railing around 3am when they were negotiating a sharp turn on the bridge. They were flung in the air after the crash and fell on the road below the flyover, police added. This was the third accident at the spot in the past six months. Five persons died and three persons were critically injured in these accidents. The deceased were identified as Akashy Kumar (26) and Harsh Vardhan Singh (28) and the injured as Rahul Singh (26). A constable on patrol duty found the three men lying in a pool of blood below the flyover which connects Lohia Crossing to Indira Gandhi Pratishthan. He called for back up from Vibhuti Khand police station. Police took the three men to the nearby Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where Akshay and Harsh were declared brought dead. Rahul, who suffered injuries in the abdomen, was referred to KGMU. Sub-inspector Shivendra Singh of Vibhuti Khand police station said the deceased were identified from ID proofs they were carrying. The bike was registered in Harsh’s name. Prima facie it appears that Akshay was driving the bike while Harsh was sitting in the middle and Rahul was riding pillion, police said. “It also seems that the victims were drunk at the time of accident,” said SHO Vibhuti Khand Rajeev Dwivedi. The bodies have been sent for postmortem examination and families of all the three victims informed. Akshay, a native of Pratapgarh, lived in a rented home in Kamta near Chinhat, while Harsh, a native of Gonda, lived in a rented home in Gomtinagar extension. Rahul, a native of Shahjahanpur, lives in Alambagh. All the three worked in a hotel in Vibhuti Khand. "
Lucknow,"‘Bylanes mosquito dens, but in Lucknow Municipal Corporation fogging blind spot’","LUCKNOW: Dengue has claimed a life in the city and the number of cases is nearing 500 but fogging by Lucknow Municipal Corporation remains unsatisfactory. Residents of several prominent areas have complained about irregular and inappropriate fogging, leading to mosquito menace in their localities. According to LMC officials, the civic body has deployed 25 vehicles with fogging machine to conduct fogging in all eight zones in the city. LMC has also deployed 60 cycles on which the fogging machine has been installed to cover inner lanes where the fogging truck cannot reached. Each fogging vehicle takes one round of every ward, spending 45 minutes in fogging. However, a TOI reality check in areas like Rajajipuram, Mahanagar, Shardanagar Vikasnagar, Gomtinagar and Aliganj found that people were complaining about half-hearted effort on the part of LMC workers. In Vikasnagar, residents complained that even after fogging in their locality, there was no let-up in the mosquito menace. “LMC vehicle came for fogging last month, but it did not enter the narrow lanes of my locality. As a result, the situation continues to be the same even after fogging,” said Sanjeev Jain. Varun Mishra of Vivek Khand said, “The fogging machine did not even spend one minute in my area. The fogging smoke was so weak that it was barely visible.” According to health department records, Shardanagar has been the worst hit when it comes to dengue cases. Retired IPS officer KND Dwivedi, a TOI reader who wrote to us, suggested that fogging drives should be conducted inside narrow lanes and inside every house rather than on roads. He added he had conducted fogging and anti-larva drives around his house in the past on his own. “These workers do not conduct fogging even for a minute and just speed away. Fogging on roads is ineffective as the real problem lies in small drains inside narrow lanes,” said Dwivedi. LMC officials, however, said, “All 25 vehicles and 60 cycles are deputed daily to conduct fogging. We will now conduct fogging two times a day to control the mosquito menace.” "
Lucknow,"With e-payments, no more halting at UP’s toll plazas","LUCKNOW: Now, traffic on national highways and state expressways won’t halt at toll plazas after the mandatory fast-tag system comes into effect from December 1. An MoU to this effect was signed between Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority and National Highways Authority of India in Delhi on Monday. UPEIDA CEO and additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi, said the MoU will pave way for fast-moving four-wheelers to adopt fast tag system — drivers won’t stop at toll plazas after digital payment of toll tax. Awasthi said the fast-tag system was functional on 303km Agra-Lucknow expressway and from December 1, the new digital payment system on toll plazas would be mandatory on NHAI highways and new expressways, including Poorvanchal, Bundelkhand and Ganga expressways. Later, while chairing the 50th meeting of UPEIDA in Lucknow, Awasthi claimed UPEIDA had created history by holding 20 meetings in last two-and-half years while only 30 meetings were held in seven years since UPEIDA came to an existence in 2007. After chairing the board meeting, Awasthi said UPEIDA’s major projects were reviewed and members of the board expressed satisfaction over the pace of over Rs 60,000-crore projects, including Poorvanchal, Bundelkhand and Ganga expressways. Addressing the board meeting, Awasthi said, the Poorvanchal expressway would be complete by June 2020 and work on Bundelkhand expressway was in full swing. He maintained that UPEIDA was the biggest construction agency in the state that was handling key projects of over Rs 60,000 crore. "
Kanpur,"UP: Hardoi girl sold for Rs 50,000 five years ago, traced via App","LUCKNOW: A 14-year-old girl, ditched by her lover while planning to elope, landed in the hands of human traffickers and was sold for Rs 50,000, and lived about 100 km away from her native place but couldn’t muster the courage to contact her parents. The girl, now 19, married and mother of a three-year-old daughter, was recovered by the sleuths of the Special Task Force (STF) who traced her via a phone caller identification app. A case of kidnapping a minor lodged in Hardoi in 2014 was handed over to STF on September 14. The STF recovered the girl from Sitapur on Monday. A senior STF officer who led the investigation told TOI, “The case was worked out through the ‘Truecaller’ app. “First, we interrogated three persons arrested by local police when the girl’s parents lodged a named kidnapping complaint. Then we checked around 5,000 calls made on the phones of her parents,” he added. “We noticed some incoming calls did not mature but were dialed repeatedly in last few months. When we checked the number on the app, the missing girl’s name appeared. We cross-verified the identity, registered SIM address and location with the telecom operator. A team was dispatched to the address mentioned and it traced the girl in Baznagar village under Biswan police station in Sitapur district. “The girl cried bitterly when we traced her and narrated her ordeal. She said one Satendra had promised to marry her and promised to elope with her on May 20, 2014, but ditched her at the last moment. Satendra had asked her to come to the railway station to elope to Kanpur, but he did not turn up himself. In a state of shock, she boarded a train to Kanpur. At Kanpur station, she met one Jhankar who sold her to one Narendra of Sitapur for Rs 50,000. Narendra married her to his son Anand,” said SSP, STF, Rajeev Mishra. She remembered her mother’s number and dialled it many times, but couldn’t muster the courage to talk to her and always disconnected the call when it started ringing. “The girl’s statement will be recorded under section 164 of CrPC and the court will decide her fate,” said Mishra.

Lucknow,BJP gears up to eat into Mayawati votebank in 3 reserved seats,"LUCKNOW: As chief minister Yogi Adityanath gears up for a whirlwind tour of 11 bypoll-bound assembly seats from Tuesday, political spotlight will be on three reserved seats – Balha, Iglas and Zaidpur – which are set to witness a keen contest between BJP and BSP. Riding on its improved performance in recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections, BSP would like to consolidate its core Dalit vote base. BJP, however, will try to make inroads into Mayawati’s core votebank. In 2017 assembly elections, BJP swept all three reserved seats, surpassing the combined vote share of SP and BSP in Balha and Iglas. In Zaidpur, however, BJP faced challenge from Congress’s Tanuj Punia, son of senior party leader and former bureaucrat PL Punia. BJP’s Akshaywar Lal cornered more than 53% votes in Balha while BJP’s Rajveer Singh Diler bagged over 55% vote share in Iglas. In both the constituencies, BSP stood second with around 29% votes in Balha and 23% in Iglas. In Zaidpur, BSP’s Meeta Gautam was pushed to third spot with only around 19% votes. In 2012 assembly election, BJP could bag only Balha seat where its candidate Savitri Bai Phule emerged victorious. Phule has now joined the Congress. Similarly, Iglas was won by RLD’s Triloki Ram while Zaidpur seat was bagged by SP’s Ram Gopal. Except for 2007, when it successfully experimented with social engineering formula, BSP has failed to perform well in reserved seats as Dalit votes got divided and the party could not win support of other communities. This time, BJP has fielded Rajkumar Sahyogi, a district-level functionary, in Iglas after its MLA Rajveer Singh Diler got elected to Lok Sabha. Sahyogi will be up against BSP’s Abhay Kumar and Congress’s Umesh Diwakar. Samajwadi Party has given the seat to its ally RLD but its candidate Suman Diwakar’s nomination was turned down for lack of documents. Diwakar will be contesting as an independent. In Zaidpur, BJP is betting on Ambrish Rawat, a local unit functionary, who will face Congress’s Tanuj Punia, SP’s Gaurav Rawat and BSP’s zonal coordinator Akhilesh Ambedkar. BJP has fielded Saroj Sonkar, a district unit functionary, from Balha where she will be challenged by SP’s Kiran Bharti, BSP’s Ramesh Chandra and Congress’s Mannu Devi. BJP sources said even as the party is banking on the popularity of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath, it has asked cabinet minister Ramapati Shastri to camp in Balha. BJP has roped in cabinet minister Suresh Rana, a Jat, to campaign in Iglas and counter RLD functionaries. The party has asked cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya to stay in Zaidpur to assess the strategy of Congress and BSP. "
Lucknow,Lucknow: Faulty flyover design to blame?,"LUCKNOW: Is there some engineering flaw on Vibhuti Khand flyover? After three accidents on Vibhuti Khand flyover which claimed five lives, Lucknow Police finally woke up on Monday and asked the public works department (PWD) to conduct a safety and engineering audit of the route. “We have written to the PWD to conduct an audit and suggest the measures to be taken for the safety of commuters,” said assistant superintendent of police, traffic, Poornendu Singh. He also said that the speed limit on Lohia Path to Vibhuti Khand flyover is 40km/hour but many commuters flout the rule. In all the three accidents on this flyover, victims had flouted the speed limit rule. A public works department official said the department will inspect the route and take corrective measures if needed. However, commuters complain that the sharp turn on the flyover is dangerous and they have to be cautious while negotiating it. There is a speed breaker ahead of the turn and yet there is no signage warning drivers to slow down. "
Ghaziabad,Split vote to ensure Dalit hub’s BJP tilt?,"MANIKPUR (CHITRAKOOT): Once a BSP bastion due to its high Dalit vote-bank, Manikpur in Chitrakoot district shifted allegiance to BJP in 2014 when a strong Modi wave swept the country. Since then, the party has been winning all major elections, but it’s leaving no stone unturned to bag this seat. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been nurturing Chitrakoot, which bears the legacy of Lord Ram. In past few months, he has visited the district thrice, including once to launch a ropeway. In the run-up to elections, various senior leaders have made a beeline to the constituency, including state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. Despite its religious significance, Manikpur continues to remain in the blind spot of development with a dilapidated civic infrastructure and perennial water crisis, the hallmark of Bundelkhand region. While benefits of PM Awaas Yojana are trickling down to villagers, most complained they still don’t have access to toilets even though the state has been declared open-defecation free. However, political parties continue to bank on caste equations. The seat has roughly 65,000 Brahmins, 45,000 Chamars, 37,000 Kols, 27,000 Patels, 19,000 Nishads, 10,000 Muslims and about 7,000 Thakurs. Where BJP is banking on its standing among Brahmins and PM Modi’s name, BSP has fielded a Kol and hopes that caste consolidation will see the party through. The Samajwadi Party candidate, Nirbhaya Singh Patel, is a backward and between SP and BSP, the vote-bank is expected to split. Meanwhile, Congress is making this an outsider versus insider fight, claiming candidates of the other three parties are not from Manikpur. Ranjana Baratilal Pandey, contesting her third election, is making this her poll plank while canvassing for votes. “The SP candidate lives in Allahabad, the BJP candidate in Ghaziabad and the BSP candidate is from Mirzapur. They will not be here when you need them. I am, however, from Manikpur and will always be at your beck and call,” Pandey tells each person during her door-to-door campaign. Raj Narain Kol, the BSP candidate, does not refute Pandey, but says if Narendra Modi can come from Gujarat to fight elections from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, at least Kol belongs to the state. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Residents, builder spar over amenities in society","GHAZIABAD: There seems to be no end to the dispute between the residents of Aura Chimera in Raj Nagar Extension and its developer over several infrastructure-related issues in the highrise apartment complex. Around 650 families stay in the housing society that has around 800 flats. A group of residents met the DM, the SSP and the Ghaziabad Development Authority vice-chairperson on Monday and alleged that instead of resolving the infrastructural issues, the developer has been employing several “arm-twisting” measures like issuing notices to some people about their source of money for buying flats in the society. Moreover, they alleged that the builder has given a “false” complaint against some residents for employing bouncers and creating nuisance in the society. Apartment owners association (AOA) president Praveen Chaudhary said, “The builder has now started threatening residents with the sole motive of muzzling their voices. It is beyond our understanding that under which rule he is seeking details about the source of money for buying flats. It is the purview of the income tax department.” However, when contacted, Anil Jain, the director of Aura Chimera, told TOI, “We are seeking such details from only those people who bought the flats in resale, as the income tax department has demanded the information from us to check benami properties and whether black money was used in the transaction.” Asked about filing a police complaint against residents, Jain said “some of them do not allow him and his staff to enter the society”. But the residents said that electrical wires have been lying in the open for several years now, the lifts in in the society are faulty and the water supply is erratic. “The builder has given police complaint against 12 residents, including me, as we are vocal about the developer’s poor approach towards the society’s issues,” Durgesh Yadav said. “The builder has not even taken a permanent connection from the electricity department,” Chaudhary added on Monday. When contacted, Sanjay Kumar, OSD to GDA, said that “taking into account the deplorable condition of civic amenities, a notice was issued to the developer on October 14, directing him to start the work immediately. I will also conduct an inspection of the society on Thursday and put the case before UP-Rera.” Jain said that infrastructure-related work has been started and that he has sought time from the GDA to complete the same.

Ghaziabad,Convenience stores to be only allowed inside Ghaziabad societies,"GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Development Authority has directed all upcoming residential colonies to allow convenience stores to be set up only inside its premises. The Authority officials said the decision has been taken to ease the traffic chaos caused due to shops present at the front portion of societies. GDA vice-chairperson Kanchan Verma said such shops are meant only for society residents, but the rule is never followed and they are thrown open for outsiders. This, she said, leads to traffic-related issues. “We are passing only those map layouts that have shops inside the premises. Earlier, it was not anticipated that giving permission to convenience shops on the front side would lead to so many issues,” she added. In August, the GDA had issued notices to developers of fourgroup-housing societies in Raj Nagar Extension that opened shopping complexes foroutsiders. They were directed to build a wall on the front side of the complex tolimit access to the shops. Later, it was found that there was no mention of a wall infront of the shopping complexes in the GDA-approved maps. The builders were supposed to develop a green area at the front and barricade it. Verma said she would review the progress made bythe builders and take appropriate action. Currently, a large number of people from nearby localities visit these shopping complexes and in the absence of proper parking spaces, theypark their vehicles by the roadside causing traffic snarls.

Lucknow,"Can't hike pay, UP to terminate jobs of 25,000 home guards","LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government is doing away with 25,000 home guards, saying the state cannot afford the new allowances the Supreme Court has asked it to pay. The daily allowance for the home guards is now Rs 672, up from the Rs 500 before the court order in July. The government said this would have cost the state an extra expenditure of Rs 10 to Rs 12 crore every month. It, therefore, decided not to deploy home guards meant for security at police stations and traffic signals. The home guards are not permanent employees and are recruited on a casual basis. The government later said that it is trying to find a solution to the problem. When asked about the matter, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari told reporters in Ayodhya, ""Diwali will be celebrated in every household. We are mulling on how this problem can be resolved."" Officials said a large number of home guards were taken on in April. The Supreme Court in July, however, meant a hike in the cost of deploying them. ""The decision not to deploy 25,000 home guards was taken on August 28 this year in a meeting chaired by the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary,"" according to an order issued by additional director general BP Jogdand.

Lucknow,Umbha man who helped Priyanka Gandhi Vadra meet tribals is Sonbhadra Congress chief,"LUCKNOW: When Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tried to meet the injured tribals and families of the 11 killed in the July 17 Umbha massacre, she was stopped in Mirzapur and detained at Chunar Guest House. She refused to leave without meeting the victims and spent the night at the guest house and finally met some families who were brought to the guest house. Ramrajya Gond, a young man from Umbha village had managed to contact Priyanka and helped her connect with the grieving families. Three months since, on Tuesday, Gond was appointed as chief of the party’s Sonbhadra unit even as heads of Amethi and Rae Bareli district units were removed. Party sources said Gond was hand-picked and rewarded by Priyanka. “Ramrajya Gond, 32, a graduate, has been raising the issues of tribals but was booked under Goonda act by government,” said UP Congress general secretary Rakesh Sachan. Ramrajya’s father Bahadur was village head of Umbha and was head of block-level Congress committee. “The announcement has come as a surprise. Priyanka didi has entrusted a big responsibility to me. I don’t believe in making tall claims... my work will speak instead,” Ramrajya told TOI. “A large number of tribals live in Sonbhadra. A lot needs to be done to bring them in the mainstream,” he added. On July 17, the main accused, village head Yagyadatt, and his aides had attacked tribals in an attempt to evict them forcefully from the land. As many as 11 persons were killed and over two dozen injured in the indiscriminate firing. Meanwhile, the party appointed 51 district level heads on Tuesday, a task pending since July 2017 when Raj Babbar took charge of UP Congress. The party has replaced its Amethi and Rae Bareli district heads. Pradeep Singhal has been appointed in place of Yogendra Mishra in Amethi, the seat Congress lost in Lok Sabha elections, Pankaj Tewari has been chosen to lead Rae Bareli unit instead of V K Shukla. “The appointments are in consonance with party’s philosophy. Committed cadres, student leaders and social activists have been made the face of party’s unit in districts,” said UP Congress administrative department in-charge Siddhartpriya Srivastava. "
Lucknow,Etawah Safari lion gave up food 5 days before death,"LUCKNOW: Adult lion, Tauqeer, which died in Etawah Lion Safari last week, had only 30% of its lungs functioning, its urine had traces of pus and kidney was severely infected with foreign particles. According to initial findings, the nine-year-old had not eaten since September 26 — the day it reached Etawah after a long journey from Junagarh zoo in Gujarat — till September 30. Was Tauqeer in trauma? Will any report analyse the mental state of the lion which travelled a long distance on a truck, packed in an enclosure, and was kept separately from others in an unfamiliar ambience? “We are waiting for the postmortem report,” said VK Singh, director, Etawah Lion Safari. To be doubly sure of the lions’ health, the state government had got each of the eight big cats medically examined before bringing them to UP. After one of the females was found unfit, the government brought seven lions to Etawah. Tauqeer did not show signs of illness and used to stroll in its enclosure, though for a shorter duration. Vets and safari administration had an idea that the lion was low on energy. After September 30 till October 4, it had frugal meals. On October 5 and 6, it hardly ate but had water. On October 6, it gave up water as well. According to the safari administration, the lion’s behaviour was not normal. It got close to the source of water in its enclosure several times but did not drink. Each of its movement was watched through CCTV camera. In between, veterinary experts from Mathura and Bareilly visited the safari and examined Tauqeer. On October 10, the lion also developed fever. Tauqeer, as it breathed its last around 1am on October 11, took a short stroll and then slumped to never get up again. Its medical reports showed no hints of Canine Distemper Virus, the contagion that claimed five lives at the safari between 2013 and 2015. The level to which its condition had deteriorated showed it was not a new infection that the lion could have caught recently. Meanwhile, turmeric spray has been done in the area where six remaining lions have been kept. The 21-day quarantine period has further been extended to 45 days. "
Kanpur,"Law on triple talaq ended maulanakaran of politics, says Yogi Adityanath","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said the law banning instant triple talaq has ended ‘maulanakaran’ of politics in the country. “Triple talaq kanoon ne rajneeti ka maulanakaran band kiya hai,” he said while campaigning for BJP’s Lucknow Cantt candidate Suresh Tewari. Yogi, who returned to UP after campaigning in Maharashtra and Harayana, addressed back-to-back rallies in Lucknow, Kanpur, Chitrakoot and Pratapgarh on Tuesday. Stating that the country would be governed by the Constitution and not fatwas, he said it was only after 70 years that Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir was abrogated and law was brought against triple talaq by the BJP regime. “BJP does not do politics of appeasement of certain caste and religion,” the CM said, exhorting party supporters to take the message to each household. He said even BR Ambedkar was against Article 370. “People doing politics in the name of Ambedkar should understand that there cannot be two laws within one country,” Yogi said in an apparent swipe at Opposition parties. Terming Lucknow as the city of Laxman (the younger brother of Lord Ram), Yogi said the city has been the karmbhoomi of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and now defence minister Rajnath Singh. He said the people of Lucknow have sent a large number of BJP leaders not only to the Lok Sabha but also to UP assembly, municipal corporations and local bodies. “BJP is a party of workers and is not restricted to one family,” the CM said amid loud cheers of ‘Jai Sri Ram’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ by BJP functionaries. In Pratapgarh, the CM categorically tore into Congress accusing it of opposing Article 370 which was a ‘blot on Kashmir’. He also lashed out at SP and BSP for promoting nepotism and casteism, the repercussions of which are being faced by the people of the state. “Development and good governance is not on the agenda of these parties. One should not expect development measures from them,” he underlined. Addressing a rally in Chitrakoot, Yogi said that tanks manufactured in the defence corridor will have Chitrakoot inscribed on them. “This is a holy land where Lord Ram spent his time in exile. But for the past 15 years, SP, BSP and Congress, in connivance with contractors, looted funds meant for the development of the region,” he alleged.  Campaigning for BJP candidate from Govindnagar constituency Surendra Maithani, Yogi announced that the Kanpur Metro rail project will gain momentum once byelections are over. "

Lucknow,Jolt to Congress ahead of bypolls: 3-time former MP Ratna Singh joins BJP,"LUCKNOW: In a major setback to Congress ahead of crucial assembly bypoll in Pratapgarh, party’s three-time MP from the Lok Sabha seat, Rajkumari Ratna Singh, joined Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday in the presence of CM Yogi Adityanath at a rally for Raj Kumar Pal, contesting on Apna Dal ticket. Singh, a Congress MP in 1996, 1999 and 2009, reached Gadhwa Inter College ground, the venue for CM’s rally, along with hundreds of supporters and joined BJP. An erstwhile royalty from Kalakankar, Pratapgarh, Singh’s entry is poised to give a psychological thrust to BJP’s bypoll campaign given her political stature in the region. Her father, Dinesh Singh, was very close to Indira Gandhi and served as external affairs minister twice in Congress governments, besides holding other portfolios at different times. He was very popular in the region and had represented the Pratapgarh seat several times. Singh thus joins the list of Congress leaders, who crossed over to BJP though they were close to Gandhi-Nehru family. In August, Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Sanjay Sinh, had quit Congress and joined BJP. His wife, Amita, who was MLA from Amethi also moved with him. Last year, Congress MLC from Congress bastion of Rae Bareli, Dinesh Pratap Singh, had joined BJP with his brothers. It was more embarrassing for Congress since Singh had been campaigning for the bypoll party candidate Neeraj Tripathi. Singh’s defection comes days after Congress effected major changes in state unit and appointed Ajay Kumar Lallu as UPCC president. Sources said Singh was not happy with the changes. Sources said BJP had kept Singh’s switch under wraps till the last moment. "
Lucknow,Uttar Pradesh: Women officers to fan out in districts from Friday,"LUCKNOW: In a major outreach programme for women, CM Yogi Adityanath has appointed lady officers from IAS, IFS, PCS, IPS and PPS cadres to visit each of state’s 75 districts and monitor the implementation of women specific programmes. They have been asked to submit reports before October 25, when the government is scheduled to launch its flagship Kanya Sumangala Scheme. The lady officers have been asked to check implementation of triple talaq law, tradition of ‘pradhan patis’ where seats are reserved for women, facilities for women staff at jails, police stations and other government institutes, and awareness about various government schemes. He urged the teams appointed for Chitrakoot, Banda and Sitapur to check action taken in complaints made to anti-Romeo squads as cases have been high but no arrests made in these districts. A senior officer present in the meeting with CM on Tuesday evening, told TOI they have been given three days (October 18-20) to visit districts. “The CM said we, as women, have worked hard to reach where we are and should work to uplift others. The CM said that as women, we would be able to get a better idea of how well programmes are being implemented and women will open up with us and share their problems,” she said. A team of three officers, led by the senior-most officer, has been appointed for each district. They have to collect contact details of each person they speak to for follow up after three months. “We have been asked to check the implementation of 26 schemes under 15 departments. Women welfare department is the nodal agency,” said another officer. They will ask respondents whether they are registered under MNREGA, if they get work for mandated 100 days, if action is taken in complaints on 1090 and how FIRs, especially in sexual harassment cases, are handled. The teams will also look into action being taken to prevent crime, condition of jails, police stations, and facilities like toilets for women staff. "
Lucknow,HC revokes anticipatory bail of Lucknow hotelier,"LUCKNOW: Upholding that ‘an absconder’ or ‘a proclaimed offender’ should not be granted anticipatory bail, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court has cancelled the same granted to a city hotel owner by a sessions court. An 11-year-old boy had fallen to death from the third floor of the hotel, where he was attending a party hosted by a relative, because of a doddering balcony railing. Passing the order Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh said, “The power to grant anticipatory bail is an extraordinary power and it should be exercised sparingly.” The HC bench observed that the sessions court had not considered the aspects regarding issuance of a non-bailable warrant and the process to declare the owner a proclaimed offender while granting anticipatory bail. It also did not take into consideration the directives of CJM to police officers, asking them to instruct the investigating officer to arrest the owner and manager of the hotel, it said. The tragedy had taken place at a hotel near the new high court building, on December 21, 2018. The hotel was allegedly built without permission from LDA or LMC. It has been alleged that the balcony railing on the third floor, was not properly fixed. Hence, the death of the child was not an accident, but culpable homicide for which the hotel owner and manager should be held responsible. "

Lucknow,"Lucknow Development Authority to charge for maintenance, water","LUCKNOW: More than 50,000 residents of standalone flats and housing societies, made and maintained by Lucknow Development Authority, will have to face an extra annual burden of Rs 12,000, which will be levied from the next financial year as user charges for water supply and maintenance. According to officials, so far, LDA had offered these services for free though they are annually worth Rs 6 crore. However, a proposal to change the freebie policy has been mooted in the wake of a financial crunch caused by LDA properties that remain unsold in the city. The user charges will be levied in residential areas like Jankipuram and Gomtinagar extensions, Sarojininagar, Transportnagar, Priyadarshni Colony and Mansarovar Colony by the end of March once the proposal receives a final nod from the LDA board. The allottees will have to pay for water supply, cleaning and interlocking of drains and collection of door-to-door garbage. Lucknow Development Authority vice-chairman PN Singh said the plan to charge a maintenance fee from allottees was made earlier this year. “However, it took time to collect all required documents and draft a formal proposal for approval of board members. The new policy will be implemented from the next financial year,” he added. "
Lucknow,"Lucknow: Armed gang crashes birthday party, harasses woman, assaults men","LUCKNOW: A group of 12 youths — at least one of them carrying a gun — allegedly gatecrashed a birthday party at a ritzy lounge in Gomtinagar, harassed a woman on the dance floor and assaulted two of her male friends with beer bottles before speeding away unchallenged in two vehicles.

Lucknow,This Manikpur ‘Sherni’ who took on Dadua swears by BSP but roots for SP,"MANIKPUR (CHITRAKOOT): Harijanpur in Chitrakoot district’s Manikpur assembly constituency is like any other village in the considerably underdeveloped area: Mud-caked hutments, absence of drains and dusty pathways connecting one settlement with another. However, there is one thing about this village that makes it extraordinary. It was from here in 2002 that Dadua’s gang members were chased away by villagers, led by Ram Lalli. Now, her door proudly bears the sign ‘Patha ki Sherni’. Now likely in her 60s, Lalli’s lean frame and wrinkles are no signs of weakness. She moves around with a gun and has been a staunch follower of the Bahujan movement. She dedicated her youth to Kanshi Ram after he founded the BSP, but is campaigning for Samajwadi Party in this byelection. She said, “We were sitting down for our meal when one boy tore into our hut. He had been kidnapped by Dadua’s men from MP but had managed to escape and reach our village. This was at the peak of Dadua’s power and his men did not expect any resistance from the villagers. However, I resolved I will not let any harm come to the boy as he had come to my house.” Armed with axes and saws, Lalli led the charge and dacoits had to beat a retreat. When news spread, she was felicitated by governor in Lucknow. “Why should I have been scared? Are women weak? I challenged them to touch the boy but they ran. Our people have been harassed for years. We know we all have to die one day but when those dacoits came in front of us, we have been scared. Laxmi Bai, Sarojini Naidu, Indira Gandhi... all fought. I am a woman, I have power,” said Lalli, dressed in an off-white salwar kurta and stole, in a reminder of what BSP chief Mayawati dons. ‘We suspect foul play, hold polls again’Currently, Lalli and her supporters have a single agenda, which is to ensure that BJP does not win the bypolls. If that means that she will back SP instead of BSP, she has no qualms about it. “There is a huge Dalit population in Manikpur, despite which the BSP-SP alliance lost in the Lok Sabha election. We are suspicious of the EVMs and challenge the government to hold elections through ballot paper,” she said. Admitting that she is still devoted to BSP chief Mayawati, as are her several followers, Lalli says campaigning for SP is a politically driven move. “I have been a follower of BR Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram and have given my life to BSP. Mayawati is everything for us. Electorally however, I will work for whichever party I believe can defeat BJP,” she said. "
Lucknow,Will convert to Buddhism at appropriate time: Mayawati,"LUCKNOW: BSP supremo Mayawati said that she will 'definitely' convert to Buddhism, but will do so at appropriate time. The right time, she said, would be when BR Ambedkar's followers from across the country will convert with her in large numbers. Addressing an election rally in Nagpur on Monday, she reminded the gathering that BR Ambedkar had converted to Buddhism with his followers in Nagpur on October 14, 1956, exactly 63 years ago. ""He did not take the decision suddenly. When he was being humiliated as a Hindu, he used to say that being born as a Hindu was not in his hands, but he would not die a Hindu. Had he converted immediately, very few people would have converted with him. Therefore, he spent years in enlightening them, and converted when his health started to deteriorate,"" she added. Mayawati also chastised her followers for failing to ensure BSP's win from any Maharashtra seat. Mayawati said she would convert when many others would join her, but added the maneuver would be futile if Ambedkar's followers don't implement his teachings in politics. ‘Upset with Ambedkar’s followers’You shout his slogan, ‘Vote humara, raj tumhara, nahin chalega’, but unless you implement it, it won’t work. You claim to be followers of Babasaheb and criticise casteist and capitalist forces, but when it comes to voting, you panic,” she said. She added that like Kanshiram, she is also disappointed with Ambedkar’s followers in Maharashtra as they have not shown any result so far, referring to BSP failing to win a seat. “Various parties ruled in Centre and states, but Dalits, backwards, Muslims, tribals have not seen any significant development. Don’t you worry about going backward in life?,” she asked. Mayawati also opposed the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s statement saying Muslims are happy in India because it is a Hindu nation. “Our party doesn’t agree with this. Before making statements, he should reach Sachar Committee report. Ambedkar did not frame the Constitution only for Hindus, but for all religions. He wanted a united country, so our party supported abrogation of Article 370, but this doesn’t mean we will support BJP’s incorrect policies or actions,” she said. "
Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Law student was throttled to death, says autopsy","GHAZIABAD: The 30-year-law student, whose body was found buried 6ft under the basement room of his landlord in Sahibabad, died because of strangulation, police have said, quoting from the autopsy report. The report also said Pankaj Singh, a fourth-year student of LLB in a private college, died at least five days ago and his body was buried a few hours after his death. On Monday, the decomposed body of Pankaj was found buried 6ft under the concrete floor of one of the rooms his landlord Munna Yadav had built recently in the basement of his three-storey house. Munna is absconding with his family. The student’s father has accused Munna of murdering his son because Pankaj apparently refused to sell his cybercafé to the landlord. “Asphyxiation due to ante-mortem strangulation,” the autopsy report mentioned as the cause of death. Police suspect a piece of cloth was used to strangulate Pankaj. Rakesh Kumar, a medical officer at MMG hospital, where the autopsy was conducted, said, “It is sudden unnatural dead, placed in the category of homicide. Even the body is five days old.” Meanwhile, police are yet to trace the landlord, Munna, and his family. Cops suspect he may have fled to Bihar and two teams have been sent to trace him. “We have put the phone numbers on surveillance. Initial investigation has suggested that Munna sent his family to his native place in Bihar via train or bus and he fled to another place,” said Rakesh Kumar Mishra, the circle officer in Sahibabad. Police have also got five bottles of deodorant and 10 cans of room freshener from the house. Police suspect the perfumes had been kept to hide the smell of the body. Pankaj’s family members said they would stage protests outside the offices of the SSP and the district magistrate if the main accused wasn’t arrested soon. "

Ghaziabad,Residents threaten to start a protest in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: A residents’ group has threatened to launch protests in Ghaziabad if the ban on diesel gensets is implemented in the city without working out a feasible solution. The Federation of Apartment Owners Association (FedAOA) also pointed out that group housing societies do not have the mechanism to separate power supply from gensets to lifts and other parts of a housing society, which makes the EPCA order restricting use of gensets for elevator services impractical. Moreover, AOAs have decided to oppose the move in case the authorities try to implement it in Ghaziabad. Alok Kumar, convener of the FedAOA, said, “We will oppose the ban. It is practically not possible to implement it here. Residents will be in big trouble. Moreover, there’s a large number of flats in various societies which do not get sunlight properly. They will plunge into darkness during an outage.” Pawan Tyagi, who heads the residents’ association at Classic Residency in Raj Nagar Extension, said people were in panic mode and sharing contradictory media reports on WhatsApp groups, which is fuelling the confusion about use of gensets. “We have not received any official information about it (the ban on gensets) so far and will be using gensets in case of power outages,” he said. Though some societies in Raj Nagar Extension reported power cuts, the discom, PVVNL, said there was no shortage in supply of electricity. It put its daily power supply at an average of 23 hours and 36 minutes. PVVNL chief engineer Rakesh Kumar said, “We have also formed patrolling teams to identify shortcomings and rectify them before Diwali and requested the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), RRTS (rapid rail) and the municipal corporation to work with extra caution so that transmission lines are not damaged.” District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey has formed a GRAP implementation squad (GIS) to oversee measures to minimise pollution levels in the district. Pandey said he will be heading the GIS, which has 28 members from various departments. The squad will ensure implementation of steps under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which kicked in on October 15. At present, Ghaziabad’s air quality index is in the “poor” category. "
Lucknow,"Unable to hike pay, will UP sack 25,000 home guards?","LUCKNOW: The UP government is mulling to lay off 25,000 more home guards on the ground that it cannot bear the burden of increased allowance, which the Supreme Court has asked it to pay to these non-permanent employees. An order to this effect was issued by UP Police Headquarters on October 11. On July 30 this year, the apex court had directed the state government to bring the allowance of home guards on a par with police constables. The government subsequently raised the allowance for home guards from Rs 500 to Rs 672, but also decided to lay off 17,000, citing financial crunch. Now, if it sacks 25,000 home guards, the total will mount to 42,000. UP has 87,000 home guards, who are deployed on security duty at police stations and for managing traffic. ADG police headquaters B P Jogdand, in a letter dated October 11 to principal secretary, home, said that in a meeting chaired by chief secretary on August 28, it was decided that posting of 25,000 home guards in various districts be terminated. Talking to TOI, Jogdand said the letter was sent to principal secretary home, DGP, all ADGs/IG zones and district police chiefs. The government has, however, decided to pay increased allowance to remaining 45,000 home guards. UP minister of sainik welfare, home guards/ PRD/civil security, Chetan Chauhan told TOI, ""No jawan will be terminated. I have spoken to the CM and a solution will come out soon."" Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi told TOI that a final decision is yet to be taken. In a letter (TOI has a copy of it) written to the state government on September 27, DGP OP Singh had urged it to reconsider the decision citing increased load on the police force during festive season.

Lucknow,Not many know that I’m ready to work again: Bhagyashree in Lucknow,"Fondly etched in the memory as the innocent and lovely Suman of 'Maine Pyaar Kiya', Bhagyashree had become a household name and an overnight superstar in the late 80s. Although the actress has been away from the silver screen for a while, she has been involved in a lot of social work. In Lucknow recently for an event, the actress spoke about her journey from a sought-after actress to one who’s now willing to get back on the big screen again, and more. You have been visiting Lucknow for a while now. How has your experience of the city been?I’ve seen Lucknow grow from a small town to a nice and clean city with bigger wider roads, more open spaces, lots of malls and brands coming in. It feels good that Lucknow is getting bigger and more in tune with what is happening in the world, I guess. The food has always been unbelievable here. I really enjoy coming and eating the delicious food out here. I love the chaat and the galawati kebabs a lot. Even shopping for chikankari is fun. In fact, most of the whites in my wardrobe are full of what I’ve brought from here. I love coming back to Lucknow for that. Your take on the #Metoo movement in Bollywood?Unfortunately, the #Metoo movement didn’t relate only to the women who are trying to raise their voice against abuse. There were a lot of women who took advantage of this to get back in a revengeful manner at men or create problems or extortion and other stuff like that. It’s very sad that these women don’t understand that for a little time of fame or money, they are creating a problem for the rural women or uneducated women of India who go through these problems continuously. You know what, its horrible how women are often used as barter revenge in villages? Essentially what I feel is that the women who were getting back at their exes or other men by using the #Metoo is very very wrong. Matlab usmein kya hota hai, it’s a consensual relationship and then you break off. At the most, you can sue the man for cheating if he’s promised you something. But it was consensual when you were doing it, so you cannot use a #Metoo and say that ‘I was raped for a couple of years or time. It’s sad that because of these women, the rest of the women who could have been helped by this movement, really don’t have a voice now. Bhagyashree (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Bhagyashree (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui) Have you ever had any #Metoo encounters or seen something like that happen during those times in Bollywood?During Maine Pyaar Kiya, Salman and I were doing a photoshoot with a photographer whose name I don’t want to disclose as he’s no more. I overheard him telling Salman that ‘Once I place the camera, you don’t have to ask her anything but just go ahead and kiss her and I will click the shot.’ To which Salman refused saying ‘This is no way to behave with a woman and unless Bhagyashree says that she is okay with it, I am not going to do anything of this sort.’ So you have one man who is saying take advantage and then you have another who is so well mannered. Fortunately for me, Salman was very protective of me at that point of time. But you never know, had it been someone else, someone other than Salman, it could have happened as the photographer wanted. Also, I’d like to add that because of that incident, my respect for Salman went up a lot. Today, however, when the time has passed and I’ve grown up and I am obviously more confident, I would have reacted in a different way. Back then, I was scared, obviously. We haven’t seen any of your work after the serial Laut Aao Trisha. When do we get to see more of you on the screen?Not many know that I’m ready to work again. Also, after Laut Aao Trisha I had a health issue. I couldn’t move my right arm at all. I had some back muscles completely worn and torn so my scapula had shifted downwards. I had calcification in my shoulder joint and pectoral muscles impinged. All of it just happened together. All the doctors that I went to told me that I would have to go for surgery, which itself I find very scary. So I decided to go against that by studying wellness, fitness, nutrition and by God’s grace, I’m pain-free now. I actually studied everything and did this program where you get to learn how your mind can control your body. I studied it and used it on my own body. Fortunately, unfortunately, my pain threshold is so high that I let it go on for so long that it allowed all these other problems to pop up. So to get back to your question, I wasn’t working in films but working on other aspects. Now, however, I’m open to listening to scripts and have done a couple of films down south. My focus has always been to choose subjects that are interesting and now with web series, the content has become so diverse and creative, it’s amazing. How was the experience of working on television? Do you wish to come back on television?Although it’s going to take some time, I feel that television honestly is going to be an outdated concept. Like if you say, we used to wear watches to check the time but now watches have become more of a style statement or piece of jewellery. People prefer checking the time on their mobiles. Similarly, I feel with digital media, even in villages people prefer watching whatever they wish to watch on their mobiles rather than purchasing a television. It’ s always good to be part of the future. Do you think your acting potential has been fully utilised by the industry?You know what the good part is, I’m still a newcomer. Since I haven’t done too many films, I feel I can be moulded like clay in the way they want me to be. Also, there are so many things people haven’t seen me do, so acchha hai, they will get to witness that side as well. There can be different aspects to me now, than there were earlier. - with inputs by Yashi Agarwal "
Kanpur,Girl counselled to overcome TB fear,"KANPUR: In a unique initiative to tackle tuberculosis, vice-chancellor of Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj University gave 11-year-old tuberculosis patient nutritious food and fruits and also counselled her so as to help her overcome the disease and its fear. Like VC Prof Neelima Gupta, other administrative officials of the university have adopted TB patients to help them beat the disease. This initiative has been taken up on the instructions of Governor Anandiben Patel. The governor, during her recent visit to the CSJM University’s convocation ceremony, had urged the students to also focus on their health apart from concentrating on studies. Taking a cue from this, university authorities decided that each senior administrative official and head of departments (HoDs) will adopt a TB patient each. Each patient will then be provided with the nutritious food and also counselling that they should not miss out on their treatment in midway or else the disease will spring back with more vigour. Prof Gupta started this special drive and provided the girl, a resident of Nawabganj, fruits and also conducted her counselling. She also counselled her family members not to stop the treatment for TB midway. The girl has been adopted by the VC. The VC said that it is a tendency among the TB patients to quit medication midway which does not help in eradication of the disease. Thus, such patients would be counselled and helped to overcmome TB and become healthy again. This is why some 30 TB patients have been adopted by the varsity. "
Lucknow,Didn't drop appeal: Sunni Waqf Board,"LUCKNOW: The UP Sunni Central Waqf Board dismissed on Wednesday reports which claimed it had agreed to withdraw its appeal in the Ayodhya case. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Sunni waqf board chairperson Zufar Farooqi said there was ""no truth"" in the reports, which started doing the rounds on Wednesday morning even as the Supreme Court continued to hear closing statements in the case. On reports that he had handed over an affidavit to the mediation panel in this regard, Farooqi said since the apex court has directed all parties to maintain confidentiality with regard to their communication with the mediation panel, he would provide an ""update"" only after the SC allowed the parties to make public their interactions with the mediators. ""No truth in reports regarding withdrawal of appeals by the board. However, there is a confidentiality order of the SC regarding mediation. (We) will update you once it is lifted,"" Farooqi told TOI. The UP Sunni Central Waqf Board is a key litigant in the title suit since the Muslim litigants in the case have been claiming ownership of the disputed land in Ayodhya under the board. Reports of the Sunni waqf board withdrawing its appeal went viral on social media on Wednesday. "
Lucknow,"No leave for cops, officials on ‘field duty’ till November-end","LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government issued orders on Wednesday announcing that no administration and police officials on ‘field duty’ in districts will be granted any leave till November 30 in the wake of festive season. The decision, significantly, came on the day of the Supreme Court concluding the hearing in Ayodhya land title suit and is expected to pronounce its verdict next month. As a matter of fact, the Diwali season comes to an end by October last, but the order signed by additional chief secretary, appointment, Mukul Singhal, attributed the decision to festival season. It said leave of officials posted in field will not be sanctioned except under unavoidable circumstances and directed officials to remain present at headquarters of their place of posting. Officials on ‘field duty’ include district magistrates and lower levels posted in districts. Later in the evening, the home department also issued an order cancelling leave of all police officers posted in districts till November 30. In a communique sent to DGP O P Singh, special secretary, home, R P Singh said officers not be given any leave except under unavoidable circumstances, while categorically mentioning the SC verdict in Ayodhya case as a reason besides the upcoming festive season. Two days ago, Ayodhya administration had imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC in the district till December 10. "
Lucknow,US woman molested on bike taxi in Nishatganj,"LUCKNOW: A 24-year-old US woman, on a work trip to the city, was allegedly molested by the driver of an app-based bike taxi on her way to an office in Nishatganj from her rented accommodation in Hazratganj on Wednesday. Accused Vijay Kumar, a resident of Indiranagar who joined the taxi aggregator three months ago, was arrested and booked for molestation and wrongful confinement following her FIR. In her complaint, the woman from Missouri said she arrived in Lucknow 15 days ago on a 10-month fellowship of the American India Foundation to work for an NGO here. She said she had been using the bike taxi service for commuting to work since Day One. Around 10am on Wednesday, she booked a ride from Sikandar Bagh Crossing in Hazratganj to New Hyderabad in Nishatganj. The driver, she said, enquired about her personal life and made unwelcome overtures. She ignored him until he sped past her office area and headed towards the deserted Gomti Bandh road. The driver allegedly began touching her inappropriately and refused to pull over. The bike screeched to a halt only when she threatened to jump off. The driver then demanded Rs 100 for the ride despite the rate quoted at the time of booking being Rs 15. The woman ran towards a crowded area to save herself before reaching her workplace. A co-worker told TOI that she was visibly distraught when she reached office. “She sobbed as she narrated her ordeal. We took her to Hazratganj police station around 11am. Police took six hours to complete formalities and lodge an FIR,” he said. Police said the accused was married and had a nineyear-old son. Hazratganj circle officer Abhay Kumar Mishra said the driver was tracked down using the registration number of the bike. “The woman’s statement will be recorded before a magistrate on Thursday,” Mishra added.

Lucknow,"Bypolls don’t affect govt, but send a message: Yogi Adityanath","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said Congress, SP and BSP had same character and were driven by greed for power. Addressing rallies in Bahraich, Barabanki, Jalalpur and Ghosi, Yogi accused the opposition of not having any interest in the welfare of country and citizens. “Anarchy, corruption and dishonesty top their agenda when they come to power,” Yogi said. “They don’t even shy away from supporting terrorism. They are not liking the dilution of Article 370 and are speaking the language of Pakistan,” he said. Yogi said improving law and order and curbing corruption were top priorities of his government. “Criminals are either behind bars or have fled the state,” he said. Yogi attacked previous SP government and said riots took place every other day in Akhilesh Yadav’s regime. “There was loss of property and restrictions were imposed on celebration of festivals. But now, no riots take place and all festivals are celebrated with zeal,” he said. The CM said the government provided over 2 lakh jobs to youth in last 30 months. “There were no complaints of any wrongs,” Yogi said. The government is also promoting sports by constructing open gymnasium and sports ground in every village, he said. Addressing a meeting at Bapu Inter College ground, Kopagunj, Mau, Yogi said byelections do not affect ruling party or government, but they do send a message. “ Upchunav se sarkar ya sattadhari party ka kuchh banta-bigadta nahi hai. Lekin ek sandesh jata hai (Bypolls don’t affect government or ruling party, but give a message,” Yogi said. Urging people to vote for Vijay Rajbhar, a vegetable seller, fielded by BJP from Ghosi, Yogi said the party chose him as he is a dedicated worker. “It is only BJP where ordinary workers can become Prime Minister, party president, MPs and MLAs. In contrast, Congress, SP and BSP patronise families, anarchy and corruption.” “Ghosi MLA Phagu Chauhan was made governor of Bihar while other MLA Dara Singh Chauhan is a cabinet minister,” Yogi said, keeping caste equations in the constituency in mind. If people ensure Vijay’s victory, he will carry forward the development started by Phagu Chauhan, he added. Referring to jailed mafia don-turned-MLA, Mukhtar Ansari, without taking his name, Yogi said, ‘Today, there is rule of law in the state. Those who used to brandish pistols and rifles publicly are either in jail or begging for their life. No criminal is allowed to create terror in the state.” Wooing Rajbhars, the CM said his government renamed medical college in Bahraich after Maharaja Suheldeo where admissions will start from coming academic session.

Kanpur,"Ram temple construction from December 6, says BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj","KANPUR: As the hearing in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case concluded in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, BJP MP from Unnao, Sakshi Maharaj, said that Ram temple construction will begin in Ayodhya from December 6. “It would be perfect that construction of Lord Shri Ram’s temple should start on the date when the structure was demolished in 1992,” Sakshi said in Unnao and added, “Once the judgement comes in favour of Lord Ram, temple will be built in a very harmonious atmosphere.” “The dream will come true with the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” he said, while addressing media in his Lok Sabha constituency. He said Muslim brethren should also come forward and help in the construction of Ram temple. “Now, Sunni Waqf Board should also accept the fact that Babar was an invader and not their ancestor,” he added.

Lucknow,Discoms under scanner as govt orders special audit,"LUCKNOW: After ordering vigilance inquiry into tenders for various power transmission and distribution projects, UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma on Wednesday ordered a special audit of finance department of all distribution companies. Issuing the order during a review meeting on purchase of power by UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL), Sharma said strict action would be initiated if any anomaly was found in procurement of power supply material like conductors, wires, poles and transformers. Sharma said the decision was taken after the department received complaints from MLAs, MPs and local residents about prevailing corruption in purchase of power. The minister also emphasised on curtailing power theft to increase electricity supply, especially to rural areas. “Round-the-clock power supply should be ensured in villages where line losses are less than 15%. The department is keen on ensuring 100% metering and laying of aerial bunch conductors to check power theft,” he said. Sharma asked senior officials to release payments of contractual staff well before Diwali. “Accountability will be fixed on outsourcing agencies and officials concerned. We are also receiving complaints about false meter reading. FIRs will be lodged against meter readers and agencies involved,” he said. The minister asked UPPCL officials to get smart meters installed in government buildings. “Proper consumer service should be ensured at sub-stations. Officials of the rank of managing director and director should conduct physical verification of sub-stations,” he added. "
Lucknow,VHP stalls Trishul Deeksha ahead of Ayodhya verdict,"LUCKNOW: As the Supreme Court reserved its verdict in Ayodhya title suit on Wednesday, Vishwa Hindu Parishad decided to stall its Trishul Deeksha programme in which cadres are trained in using trident, bearing in mind that it may send a wrong message about the Hindu community. VHP organisational secretary in UP, Bholendra, told TOI, “VHP does not want to scare anyone, and therefore Trishul Deeksha programme has been stalled. We do not want to send a wrong message of Hindu community trying to scare others.” “The other programmes of preparing VHP cadre to fight against ‘love jihad’ and religious conversion would continue,” he added. VHP sources said they were getting negative feedback about the programme in the wake of the apex court likely to pronounce its verdict next month. “Any move which portrays Hindus as aggressive would send a wrong message,” said another leader. The decision to abandon the programme was taken by top brass after hectic deliberations, said a functionary. VHP was planning to train a fresh batch of cadres in the use of ‘trishul’ (trident) even as the SC conducted day-to-day hearings. VHP had started the exercise in September in all districts through ‘Shakti Kendras’. Sources said four to five ‘Shakti Kendras’ had been set up in cities and were being supervised by senior functionaries who visited them twice a month. VHP planned to rope in 100 to 200 youth at every kendra and planned to distribute 10,000 tridents before the SC judgment. Sources said the purpose was to induct and train cadre about the importance of ‘shaastra’ (religious text) and ‘shastra’ (arms). VHP and its affiliate Bajrang Dal had conducted a similar exercise in 2017, and distributed tridents to cadres to stop cow slaughter and love jihad. "
Lucknow,Male survivors of breast cancer to walk the ramp,"LUCKNOW: In a first, two male breast cancer survivors along with 50 women survivors from various districts of the state will walk the ramp in the city to generate awareness about the disease. The programme, scheduled on October 19, is the brainchild of KGMU’s endocrine surgery department to mark a month that is observed as breast cancer awareness month worldwide. “A high level of awareness is needed for the most common form of cancer in women, both in rural and urban areas. This is one such attempt. Two men and 50 women will walk the ramp to raise awareness about early detection and treatment. The theme is pink,” said head of endocrine surgery professor Anand Mishra who is also organising secretary of the event. Currently, there is not sufficient knowledge on the causes of breast cancer and therefore, early detection remains the cornerstone of disease control. “If we can facilitate regular screening for women, we can save them from terminal illness. Even if rare, men too are at risk of breast cancer and awareness is the key,” Mishra said. According to the professor, a tumour in the breast that is 2cm or smaller in size can be contained through early screening and surgery. Recovery time is 10-20 days. However, a bigger tumour can cripple routine life, given the cycle of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. The procedures take seven to eight months, leaving a dent in family finances. The KGMU department, in association with local outfits, had organised a breast cancer awareness walk in Nainital, Uttarakhand, on October 13. "

The woman informed cops that she used to work in a cosmetic product shop but quit the job a fortnight ago after being molested by her employer. She was alone at her house in Saadatganj on Tuesday night when her ex-employer reached there and forced her to join the job again. When she refused, he assaulted her with a stick. Sub-inspector Kamlesh Kumar Gaur said: “We found injury marks on her hand. She has been sent for medical examination.” In another case, a 23-yearold woman on Wednesday lodged a complaint of molestation at Gomtinagar police station against a man, who later turned out to be her husband. The woman, a resident of Lakhimpur, said she was living in a rented house in Vineet Khand, Gomtinagar. She informed cops that she was in relationship with a man in Lakhimpur but left him two years ago.

She alleged that the man found her address and assaulted her in an inebriated state on Tuesday night. Sub-inspector Vandana Pandey said, “We found that the man was her husband. We will take action after verifying the complaint.” "
Lucknow,"Not just stray cattle, dogs &amp; monkeys also a menace in Lucknow Cantonment","LUCKNOW: Be it posh localities or narrow lanes, stray cattle, dogs and monkeys are a big menace in all of Lucknow Cantonment. The problem, say residents, is plaguing localities for two decades but no action has been taken despite numerous complaints. All elected representatives—corporators or MLAs—promise action at the time of elections but forget later, they said. Sadar &amp; Topkhana BazaarStray cattle rummaging through heaps of garbage strewn around service lanes is a common sight. The primary cause of the menace is the presence of dairies in the area. “The locality is home to more than 1,000 stray cattle. Dairy farmers leave the animals on the road all night. By the time they are taken to the dairy in the morning, they have created a mess on the roads. There is cow dung everywhere,” said Mamta Ghosh, a resident of Prabhu Dayal Marg. “Lucknow Cantonment Board claims to have caught and sent many animals to shelter homes but we don’t find any change on the streets. Stray animals also pose a threat to commuters at night when visibility is low,” added Shagun Rai. LDA Colony &amp; AashianaStray cattle, dogs and monkeys have been causing problems for residents of LDA Colony’s sectors D, F and H and Aashiana’s I, N and K. Locals have even complained of being attacked by monkeys. Reema Mahajan of sector D, LDA Colony said one day a family of four monkeys had entered her house and started eating bananas on her dining table. “In 18 years, I have never seen anyone come to catch monkeys. People have stopped sitting on their terrace because of the menace,” said Mahajan. Alambagh &amp; KrishnanagarAcross Alambagh and Krishnanagar, stray cattle roam freely on the roads and stray dogs chase two-wheelers, posing a threat to commuters. Kaustubh Sharma recently fell prey to a pack of stray dogs. “I was chased by them for nearly half-a-kilometre. I continued driving but they did not stop and eventually, my bike slipped. I had minor bruises but there have been continuous accidents due to stray animals in the area. In August, a biker died of injuries in Charbagh when his vehicle collided with a cow,” said Sharma. Old CityApart from being a threat to commuters, stray animals also hinder traffic flow in areas of Old City such as Naka Hindola, Manaknagar, Railway Colony and Aishbagh. Residents and traders of Naka Hindola raised concerns over strays damaging their cars and bikes and creating traffic congestion. “We are tired of reporting the menace. We complained to the corporation five times last year. Each time, they sent a few workers to catch the animals, which were released after a few days,” said resident Paramjeet Singh. "
Lucknow,"Stop child marriage, governor Anandiben Patel prods students","LUCKNOW: Always stand for what is right even if it means standing alone, the advice came from none other than UP governor and chancellor of state varsities Anandiben Patel as she exhorted students of APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) to fight against social evils like child marriage and dowry. Addressing the AKTU convocation on Wednesday, the governor shared an anecdote to drive home the point. She said she risked antagonising her own family by stalling her underage nephew’s wedding. “If you see a child being forced into marriage, take a stand against it,” Patel said and continued, “My brother was determined to get his son, who was still not an adult, married. When talks (within the family) failed, I lodged a complaint with police.” Patel got a stay order from a Gujarat court and the wedding didn’t take place. Her action upset her family to the extent that her brother didn’t talk to her for five years. “Child marriage is an evil practice and it is the responsibility of our young citizens, girls and boys, to take a stand against it,” she added. On a different note, the governor asked AKTU vice-chancellor Vinay Pathak to grant underprivileged students two to three hours of access to libraries and laboratories after classes get over at the university and its affiliated colleges. Taking a cue, technical education minister Kamal Rani asked toppers to help educate the needy. Earlier in the day, presenting the annual report and sharing their future plans, Pathak said by next year, the AKTU would launch e-libraries where students and teachers would be able to access books and journals round the clock.

Lucknow,Rocket woman ignites minds at Lucknow University,"LUCKNOW: Scientists never stop their research; they analyse and study more to make things happen, Ritu Karidhal said, answering an MSc student’s query on how space scientists handled the disappointment of losing Chandrayaan-2 moon lander Vikram. Karidhal, the mission director of Chandrayaan-2, was at her alma mater Lucknow University on Wednesday to deliver a lecture at the science festival organised by the physics department, where she briefly delved into the objectives of Mangalyaan and Chandrayaan programmes. She had been the chief guest at LU’s convocation on Tuesday and was conferred with D’Litt (honoris causa). Physics professor RB Singh told TOI that the “rocket woman” motivated students to take up a career in science, underlining that the Mangalyaan mission — a space probe orbiting Mars since September 2014 — was based on completely indigenous technology and a team of young scientists was behind its success. “She also asked students to conduct research based on data about both the two missions available online,” Singh added. Karidhal took a nostalgic, hour-long tour of the department from where she did her MSc in physics in 1997. “She (Karidhal) was very excited. She pointed out where she had lunch and where she did research,” said professor Manisha Gupta. Besides faculty members and students, the scientist also interacted with non-teaching employees. "
Lucknow,"Be water literate, end misuse: Rajendra Singh","LUCKNOW: Amid the country’s deepening water crisis, Rajendra Singh underscored the need for “water literacy” in every state, including UP. The Magsaysay Award-winning conservationist, better known as the Waterman of India, was addressing engineering graduates at the AKTU convocation on Wednesday. Emphasising on the judicious use of water, Singh said drought-hit districts in the country had increased 10 times to 365 since Independence and small rivers were dying. In contrast, flood-hit districts have gone up by eight times to 190 in 2019, he said. “Everyone is familiar with the saying, ‘Water is the elixir of life’. If we genuinely believe so, the country should not be facing this acute water crisis. People must become more water literate and understand the need for conservation,” he said, advocating rainwater harvesting and waste water management. Singh said during his 36-year journey as a conservationist, 12 rivers that had gone dry had been revived. He exhorted students to develop a cheap, reliable and effective technology to tide over the water crisis, particularly in rural areas and urban slums. “We need to save our country from droughts and floods. If UP takes the first step, I am sure the country will follow,” he told his audience. The crusader also lauded AKTU for introducing a research project on water conservation in villages. There are 756 colleges affiliated to AKTU and if each adopts one village, he said, a long road can be covered. "
Lucknow,Today’s engineers wish to be tomorrow’s IAS,"LUCKNOW: Deeksha Singh was confident that her hard work would pay and glory would be hers one day, but the 22-year-old Gorakhpur girl who bagged the Chancellor’s Gold Medal at the 17th convocation of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam University (AKTU) here on Wednesday says she is not done yet. Deeksha will not rest until she clears the prestigious Indian civil services exam. “It is not just about job security and stability; becoming an IAS officer empowers you in a way few professions can. It grants you the power to serve others and earn their respect in return,” she said, adding that she had already begun preparations for her next career milestone. The computer science and engineering graduate is not the only one dreaming the big dream. Many among AKTU’s medal-winning students nurture the same ambition and shared their sole goal with TOI. Amit Kumar, a gold medallist in BTech (Agriculture), wants to become an IAS officer to fight social evils and bring about changes in India’s socio-cultural system. “I want to help in the education sector. While being a civil servant has its perks, like extension after retirement, one cannot ignore the services one can and must offer being in a position of power,” said the 21-year-old Hardoi resident. With a gold medal in mechanical engineering, Vaibhav Agnihotri wants to find a solution to water crisis and work for empowerment of marginalised sections of the society. “If we talk about prestige, being an IAS officer is the most respectful job. However, my whole idea behind cracking the civil services is social welfare,” Vaibhav said, hoping that his scientific approach would help solve many problems that mire the country. Private affiliated colleges, with 47 medallists, dominated the convocation. The remaining 17 out of 66 medals went to students of government colleges. "

Ghaziabad,Custodial death: Deputy superintendent among 7 charged with murder in UP's Hapur,"MEERUT: Seven policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, have been charged with murder in the horrific custodial torture death of a 35-year-old security guard in Hapur district of Uttar Pradesh. Pradeep Tomar, a security guard, died allegedly after being tortured by cops at a police station in Hapur’s Pilkhuwa area on Sunday evening. The FIR comes a day after National Human Rights Commission took cognizance of the incident and issued notices to the chief secretary and DGP of the state. The commission has sought the status as well as action taken reports within four weeks. According to police, Pradeep had been summoned to Chijarsi outpost for interrogation in a murder case. His 10-year-old son, who accompanied him to the outpost, claimed that he was detained and brutally tortured during interrogation. “At least 8-10 policemen were constantly beating my father. They also stabbed him using screwdrivers. All this while, they were also consuming alcohol and denied water to my father who was writhing in pain,” he said. After his condition deteriorated, the cops rushed him to a local hospital in Hapur and later to a higher centre in Meerut where he succumbed to the torture inflicted on him, the family claimed. The postmortem report has also corroborated the claims of torture. “The cause of death has not been specified in the report. Viscera sample has been preserved for further analysis. There is blackening on his posterior, arm and contusion on other parts of the body,” Hapur SP Yeshveer Singh said. The deceased’s younger brother, Kuldeep Tomar, had submitted a written complaint alleging torture at the hands of DSP Santosh Mishra, Pilkhuwa SHO Yogesh Baliyan, sub-inspector Ajab Singh and four other unnamed policemen leading to his brother’s death. While SHO Baliyan, SI Singh and a constable are already under suspension, DSP Mishra was merely transferred and put in-charge of Garhmukteshwar circle. According to Hapur police, Pradeep, who used to work as a security personnel with a private factory in Ghaziabad, was picked up for interrogation as he was suspected of being in touch with accused of a murder case. “The charred body of a woman was recovered on August 30. The woman was later identified as Preeti, a resident of Jarcha in Noida and relative of Pradeep. Preeti was allegedly murdered by one Arun, who is also a relative of Pradeep. He was not directly linked to the murder but could have been part of the conspiracy,” Hapur ASP Sarvesh Mishra said. Ever since the incident, police had maintained that the victim’s family had not approached them with a written complaint and hence no FIR was registered. "

He has been named in a slew of criminal cases too. The crackdown on Samajwadi Party senior leader and MP Azam Khan has turned the bypoll in Rampur into a high voltage battle.

Gates of Azam’s haveli has been plastered with dozens of notices and summons to appear before SIT, police and the ED. But the forthcoming byelection to be held on October 21 , will be the test of the Yogi government — whether it will be able to demolish Azam Khan politically.

Kanpur,UP: TV anchor arrested for wife’s murder,"KANPUR: Etawah Police on Thursday arrested a TV anchor, his alleged paramour and his colleague for the murder of his wife. Police said that 27-year-old Divya Mishra, wife of TV anchor Ajitesh Mishra, was found murdered at the latter’s Katra Bal Singh Mohalla residence in Etawah on October 14. On Thursday, police arrested Ajitesh and his alleged paramour Bhawna Arya of Delhi and his friend Akhil Kumar Singh, a native of Faridabad, for the murder. All the three were working together at a TV channel based in New Delhi. On the complaint of Divyanshi’s father-in-law Pramod Mishra, a resident of Katra Bal Singh Mohalla, a case was registered on Monday against unidentified persons and subsequently an investigation was carried out with the help of forensic experts and dog squad. “During interrogation Ajitesh confessed that after his wife Divya came to know about his illicit relationship with another woman, she used to quarrel often,” said SSP Etawah Santosh Kumar Mishra. The couple’s relationship had turned sour even more after October 7, when Divya had entered into a verbal dual with Ajitesh’s paramour Bhawna on phone. Thereafter, in order to remove Divya from his way, Ajitesh hatched the plan to eliminate her. “He sought help from his colleague Akhil Kumar Singh,” said police. “On October 14, as per plan, Akhil reached Ajitesh’s Katra Nal Singh Mohalla residence. As Akhil was known to Divya, she gave him due welcome. Later, while Divya was showing him her marriage album, he attacked her with a flower pot repeatedly till she fainted and fell on the floor and succumbed to wounds. He thereafter escaped from the crime scene,” said a police officer. Divya, 27, was found murdered in her house in Katra Bal Singh in Etawah district on Monday afternoon. "

Lucknow,Muslim parties’ lawyers reject Ayodhya pact,"NEW DELHI/ LUCKNOW: Differences within Muslim parties over a mediated settlement came to the fore on Friday as a five-judge Supreme Court bench commenced writing the final judgment on the 70-year-long litigation for ownership of the 1,500 square yards core Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid land, which is part of the 2.77 acre disputed land in Ayodhya. Interestingly, advocates-on-record for Muslim parties, including the Sunni Wakf Board - Ejaz Maqbool, Shakil Ahmed Syed, MR Shamshad, Irshad Ahmad and Fuzail Ahmad Ayubi - issued a statement to the media assailing the settlement reached between the warring sides, with the exception of Ram Lalla through next friend, Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (both VHP backed) and a Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind faction. The five advocates-on-record slammed the settlement and said attempts by the mediation committee were not representative in character. ""It is difficult to accept that any mediation could have been done under the circumstances, especially when the main Hindu parties have openly stated that they were not open to any settlement and all the other Muslim appellants made it clear they too would not,"" they said. Their stand was endorsed by All India Muslim Personal Law Board which circulated the statement of the five lawyers, representatives of different organisations and individuals. ""We the appellants before Supreme Court don't accept the proposal nor the procedure of mediation or the manner in which a withdrawal of claim has been made as a compromise,"" the lawyers said on behalf of their clients.

It is surprising that when members of the board had authorised the chairman to sign the settlement, its advocate-on-record Shakil Ahmed Syed chose to sign a statement opposing the settlement. The SC had recently asked the UP government to give adequate protection to Faruqi. One of the lawyers, Ejaz Maqbool, emphasised that Panchu had interceded with the SC to organise security for Faruqi. The settlement, signed by Faruqi, said the UP Sunni Waqf Board had ""no objection to the acquisition by the central government of the disputed area (inner and outer courtyard ) of the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya.

The murder sparked off angry protests in the city. Kamlesh received a call around 11 am and an hour later and two saffron-clad men walked up to his first-floor office. One of the assailants asked Tewari's aide, Saurashtrajeet Singh, to buy cigarettes from the market while they offered a sweet packet with a Surat address to the self-proclaimed Hindu Mahasabha leader. When his aide returned, he found Tewari lying with his throat slit and his body ruptured with wounds. Later, autopsy confirmed a bullet injury in the chest.

Tewari triggered unrest in 2015 when he distributed pamphlets with disparaging content against Muslims. The Hindu Mahasabha later disowned him. NSA was slapped on him, but charges were quashed in 2016. Later, his name figured in the interrogation of ISIS operatives Ubaid Mirza and Kasim Stimberwala, who were arrested by Gujarat anti-terrorist squad from Ankleshwar in September, 2017. A video was seized from their possession, which talked about killing Kamlesh Tewari for his anti-Muslim stand. He was provided two gunners, but both were missing in duty for last two days. The lone constable at his residence was asleep in another room when Tewari was killed on Friday. What brought the Gujarat module under focus was the packet that the two assailants left behind, which bore the address of a confectionary store in Surat.

Lucknow,"Lucknow: Supporters block Naka, Chowk intersections for over six hours","LUCKNOW: Khursheedbagh and its adjoining areas remained tense on Friday as supporters of slain Hindu Samaj Party president Kamlesh Tewari forced shops to down shutters and blocked the busy Naka and Chowk intersections for more than six hours. The angry protesters, including Tewari's kin, raised Jai Shri Ram and anti-government slogans. They demanded the arrest of those who killed the right-wing leader at his home office in the afternoon, besides compensation for the bereaved family. A large contingent of police and over 120 RAF personnel had to be deployed. Efforts to pacify the supporters by senior officers including IG (Lucknow range) SK Bhagat, DM Kaushal Raj Sharma and even deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, who went to express his condolences, came a cropper. As the roadblock paralysed Naka, Ganeshganj, Fatehganj, Raniganj, Wasiratganj, La Touche Road and some parts of Aminabad, the cascading effect was felt across the city.  ""My son had apprised police of the threat to his life, but they didn't take him seriously. Even constables assigned for his security were absent at the time,"" said Kusum, Tewari's mother who joined the protest at Naka with his two sons. The blockade at Naka triggered major traffic snarls on all roads in Old City and on the busy Charbagh-Hazratganj route. It was withdrawn around 7pm following repeated assurances of a fair probe to Tewari's family.

Vice-chancellor SP Singh said that show-cause notices have been issued to all the teachers on the list. If they fail to provide details of expenditure within stipulated time, money will be deducted from their salaries. The anomaly was detected in the ongoing audit by a government-authorised chartered accountant who earlier this month had found that Rs 1.9 crore was siphoned off from LU’s bank account through 11 forged cheques in 2018-19. An FIR was lodged in the case and police have arrested four persons so far. "

Lucknow,"Mission cow irony: Cattle count dips in UP, buffalo tally up","LUCKNOW: Despite the central government’s Rashtriya Gokul Mission and the Yogi government’s series of cow conservation schemes, numbers of the livestock census for this year came as a disappointment to Uttar Pradesh. UP has been taken over by West Bengal to become the state with the highest cattle population over the last census. While UP still has the biggest population of livestock in the country, it has come down from the last census. However, the number of buffaloes specifically has seen a substantial rise as opposed to that of sheep, goats and pigs. The Centre’s animal husbandry department released the provisional census data of livestock population on Wednesday. This was the 20th livestock census in the country. Cattle population in UP has come down by nearly 4% from 19.6 million in 2012 to 18.8 million in 2019—behind West Bengal’s 19 million. This is a decline of 3.93% for UP over 2012 when UP had 19.6 million cattle. The number of buffaloes though increased from 30 million to 33 million or 8%, making it the highest in the country. West Bengal recorded an increase from 16.5 million cattle in 2012 to 19 million in 2019. Bihar also followed the trend with 12.2 million in the last census to 15.3 million in the current one. Decline of cattle population in UP is noteworthy keeping in mind chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s unrelenting campaign for cow conservation. He has not only ordered district authorities to build cow sheds and rear and feed cattle at government expense but is also taking strict action against erring officers. A few days ago, he had suspended the district magistrate of Maharajganj along with veterinary officers over negligence in cow protection. The government has also imposed a Re 1 cess on every liquor bottle to create a corpus fund for cow shed maintenance. However, the census shows that people are more interested in having buffaloes rather than cows. “Earlier, farmers were able to dispose unproductive and dry cows in the market and purchase new ones. In the changed policies of the BJP government, it is very difficult for farmers to sell cows so they feel discouraged. A dry buffalo though can be sold in the open market. Hence, people choose to have a buffalo,” said a former director of the state’s animal husbandry department. Amid a ban on new slaughterhouses, goat population in the state has also come down from 15.5 million to 14.4 million which would have a direct bearing on the state’s meat exports. UP is the largest meat exporter in the world. "

Lucknow,Jalalpur byelection: Dr Confidence is BSP’s rookie bet,"JALALPUR (AMBEDKARNAGAR): In Saidpur’s Nishad Basti, several women are gathered under a large tree in the middle of the village on Wednesday afternoon. They are listening intently to someone, laugh at points but mostly nod along in agreement. A young woman has their attention firmly in her grasp, telling them that she had the opportunity to stay in her airconditioned clinic in Lucknow’s KGMU and make money but has chosen to come between them so that she is able to make a difference. This person is 27-year-old Dr Chhaya Verma, BSP’s candidate for the Jalalpur byelection. After Rakesh Pandey refused the ticket for the seat, vacated when his son was elected MP from the constituency, the party gave the ticket to former minister Lalji Verma’s daughter Chhaya. This is the first election for the young eye doctor but her confidence belies her lack of experience. Focussing on backward and Dalit villages more prominently, Chhaya is especially targeting women through nukkad sabhas. “I can form a natural connect with them because I am also a woman. However, it is double work as I have to reach out to men as well who do not interact much with women. This is my challenge, to change this system and show them what an educated young girl is capable of,” Chhaya says. Growing up with her father, a former minister in Mayawati’s cabinet and an MLA from the neighbouring constituency of Tanda, Chhaya has seen politics from up close. Unlike the previous MLA who was a Brahmin, Chhaya is a Kurmi and she is focussing on villages with a high population of Dalits and backwards. “Her father is campaigning for her in all villages but she is visiting only Dalit and OBC villages. She is a new candidate and we are trying to get people from her community to get familiar with her,” said a team member. In Chhaya’s speeches, she tells the women to educate their fathers, husbands and brothers against taking alcohol and money from other parties. “These parties have done nothing for you. But for some moments of enjoyment, men are ready to sell their votes for alcohol and money. Warn them against it and vote for a better future,” she says. Chhaya’s main campaign issues are the failure of BJP to fulfil its poll promises, work done in the constituency when BSP was in power, lack of infrastructure in villages, poor standard of schools and hospitals.

On Friday, Khan was busy drawing a strategy with party in charge for Balha bypoll, Shashank Yadav at SP office in Balha. “Our relationship is not of Muslim-Dalit as many in Balha constituency perceived.

Lucknow,Ayodhya dispute: Muslim parties’ lawyers junk ‘compromise’ pact,"LUCKNOW: Five lawyers representing different organisations and individuals of Muslim side in the Ayodhya title suit, on Friday objected to the mediation panel’s report submitted to Supreme Court earlier on Wednesday, which claimed Muslim parties were ready to drop their claim. The lawyers, in a strongly worded statement issued to the press alleged the “compromise” proposal in the panel’s report was unacceptable and was also leaked to the media by either the mediation panel or Nirvani Akhara and other “limited participants” in the talks, in violation of apex court’s confidentiality clause in the mediation process. “We the appellants before Supreme Court don’t accept the proposal nor the procedure of mediation or the manner in which a withdrawal of claim has been suggested as a compromise,” said the statement on behalf of Muslim parties on Friday. It also put on record that “recent attempts before mediation committee were not representative” in nature. Issued by senior advocates on record for Muslims, Ejaz Maqbool, Shakil Ahmed Syed, MR Shamshad, Irshad Ahmad and Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, the statement hints at a “well thought-out” conspiracy to leak the mediation panel report on the day the apex court closed hearing in the Ayodhya case. Claiming to have been “taken aback by media reports of UP Sunni Central Waqf Board willing to withdraw its claim on disputed site,” lawyers said only limited persons attended the second mediation which began while the court was hearing the matter. “Only limited persons, including Dharam Das of Nirvani Akhara, Zufar Faruqui of Sunni Central Waqf Board and Chakrapani of Hindu Mahasabha attended the mediation. Two others may have also been part of the process,” read the statement.

When this second round of mediation began, a letter was sent to both Hindu and Muslim parties and both rejected the second attempt to mediate. Hindu parties stated they were not ready for any settlement and other Muslim appellants made it clear there was no possibility of a mediation again after the first attempt failed.” The statement also makes a “pertinent note” of alleged communications between senior advocate and mediation committee member, Sriram Panchu, and chairperson of the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, Zufar Faruqui.

Lucknow,UP government braces for big law &amp; order challenge as verdict day nears,"LUCKNOW: As the verdict day for the Ayodhya dispute nears, UP government faces a big challenge on the law and order front. The government is aware of the ramifications of the verdict, which could prove to be a severe threat to the socio-political fabric even beyond the temple town of Ayodhya and Lucknow or UP. For the government, there are two models — of the Kalyan Singh government in 1992 and the Mayawati government in 2010 to face the situation in Ayodhya and the state in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment. In 1992, when the BJP had formed its first majority government in UP riding on the crest of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement, then CM Kalyan Singh had ordered that no force would be used against karsewaks heading for Ayodhya for “karsewa” at the disputed site. He had also issued orders of not deploying Central paramilitary forces in Ayodhya and ordered their stationing only on the fringes of the temple town. Facing no deterrence or any obstacle, thousands of frenzied karsewaks carrying “trishuls” in their hands and armed with spade and sickles, demolished the Babri Masjid triggering riots in many parts of the country on December 2, 1992. In the Mayawati government, when the first verdict on the centuries-old dispute was to be pronounced in November 2010, she ordered that “not even a bird should flutter its wings.” The state was virtually taken over by central paramilitary forces and communally-sensitive lanes and bylanes crowded with police and para military forces. Not a single stone was pelted, after the judgment, which was peacefully challenged in the Supreme Court. On October 30, 1990, November 2, 1990 and December 2, 1992, the clashes between police and karsewaks in the Mulayam government in 1990 and then in the Kalyan government, regions in and around Ayodhya had plunged into the communal cauldron. However, this time, CM Yogi Adityanath has started working on a contingency plan to avoid the repeat of 1992 nightmare at any cost. Additional chief secretary (home) Awneesh Awasthi told TOI that the state government has already sent its requisition to the Centre for central paramilitary forces while the PAC has already been deployed in large numbers in Ayodhya. The movement of people reaching Ayodhya from all over is already under scanner and Section 144 imposed to deter people from any celebrations or congregations in the wake of SC judgment, said Awasthi, adding that to ensure adequate manpower of police, para military and government staff, the decision of cancelling their leave till November 30 has already been implemented.

Lucknow,Nine UP cities among nation’s most polluted,"LUCKNOW: Nine cities of Uttar Pradesh, including the state capital and Varanasi, figure on the list of the country’s most polluted cities, raising serious concerns among environmentalists and healthcare experts. According to data released on Friday by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) in these cities is above 200, which is categorised as ‘poor’. The index is based on the concentration of superfine particulate matter PM 2.5 in the air. Prolonged exposure to such an environment can lead to respiratory distress and diseases. With an AQI of 270, Ghaziabad was the most polluted city in the state and the second most polluted in the country after Hisar, Haryana.

Ghaziabad,Nine UP cities among nation’s most polluted,"LUCKNOW: Nine cities of Uttar Pradesh, including the state capital and Varanasi, figure on the list of the country’s most polluted cities, raising serious concerns among environmentalists and healthcare experts. According to data released on Friday by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) in these cities is above 200, which is categorised as ‘poor’. The index is based on the concentration of superfine particulate matter PM 2.5 in the air. Prolonged exposure to such an environment can lead to respiratory distress and diseases. With an AQI of 270, Ghaziabad was the most polluted city in the state and the second most polluted in the country after Hisar, Haryana. In Moradabad and Baghpat, the AQI crossed 250 while Noida and Meerut follow close on the heels with AQI above 240.

Kanpur,Kanpur: CSJMU bans use of mobile by students during teaching hours,"KANPUR: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Kanpur’s Chhatrapati Sahu Ji Maharaj University (CSJMU) has banned students from using mobile phones during teaching hours. The order, a copy of which is with TOI, is applicable to over 500 colleges spread across 15 districts. “Use of mobile phones by students during teaching hours is prohibited. Students should not talk on phone and make use of WatsApp or any other social networking site inside classrooms,” read the order issued by the university registrar to all directors and head of the departments and principals of affiliated colleges on Thursday. Any violation of the directives will be dealt as indiscipline and action will be taken against the defaulter. “The step is important to raise the quality of education,” read the order.

Lucknow,Employment crisis in India structural: Sidharth Nath Singh,"LUCKNOW: Calling the prevalent levels of unemployment in the country “structural”, state MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said that PM Narendra Modi’s attempts at streamlining India’s parallel economy had led to some disruptions but these interventions would lead to more jobs. “India is experiencing a disruptive economy, where new technology and innovation has entered the economy. Unemployment, as is being reported in the media, is structural unemployment. It means that blue or white collared jobs from 9 to 5, like bankers, doctors, engineers, government officials, can’t be seen. In India, the mindset is such that if these jobs are not available, people feel that there is something wrong with the economy,” he said. Speaking at a skill development programme on Friday, Singh said people were worrying about the GDP at 5% but that was due to global recession. However, the process to formalise the parallel economy through means like demonetisation and GST would create more jobs.

Lucknow,Kamlesh Tiwari murder case: Three arrested by Gujarat ATS; UP DGP says no link with terror organisation,"LUCKNOW: Three persons were arrested by the Gujarat ATS in Surat on Saturday for killing the president of Hindu Samaj Party, Kamlesh Tiwari. ""All three who were arrested have confessed to the crime,"" ANI quotes Gujarat ATS DIG Himanshu Shukla as saying. UP Police DGP OP Singh told media persons in Lucknow that three persons identified as Maulana Sheikh, Faizan, and Rashid Pathan have been arrested in Surat and are being interrogated. All the three are in their 20s.  ""Pathan was the mastermind of the conspiracy to murder Kamlesh as the former had made disparaging comments against Prophet in 2015,"" said Singh. “We are working in collaboration with the Gujarat ATS and till now no link with any terrorist organisation has been established. We will look into all the details and take action,” he said. ""A unit of Lucknow police is also interrogating the trio. A sweet box recovered from crime spot was a vital clue in cracking the case,"" he added. The DGP also said that Mohammed Mufti Naeem Qazmi and Imam Maulana Anuwarual Haq have been detained from UP's Bijnor. “Prima facie it appears that the killing was linked to Tiwari's remark on Prophet Muhammad in 2015, but nothing has been confirmed so far. The killers were probably radicalised after Tiwari made the controversial remark against Prophet,” said the DGP. Tiwari was shot dead at Naka area of Lucknow on Friday. He was the former leader of Hindu Mahasabha and had founded the Hindu Samaj Party. Read this story in Marathi"
Lucknow,I was called a bad luck charm when I worked in the South industry: Taapsee Pannu,"Coming from the South Industry, making a mark in Bollywood with her powerful roles in movies like 'Mulk', 'Badla', 'Mission Mangal' among others, Taapsee Pannu is one such actress who chooses movies regardless of how much they will collect at the Box Office. Taapsee believes, with her content-driven roles and by portraying strong characters, she has acquired a consistent audience. In chat with Lucknow Times while she was shooting for a film in the city, the Delhi-based actress says she intends to make more such movies in the future. Taapsee, who has shot Mulk in Lucknow earlier, and has wrapped up her second film Thappad in the city recently, says she likes the vibe Lucknow offers. ""I am coming back with the same filmmaker, same hotel and it just feels like déjà vu. This city has a different vibe. Unlike Delhi and Mumbai, Lucknow has a much laid back vibe. I remember when I was in Delhi for a movie promotion, I was looking forward to taking a flight back to Lucknow because this city kind of relaxes you when you’re here as life is a little bit relaxed here,"" says Pannu. Acting as one of the protagonists in her upcoming film 'Saand Ki Ankh', where two actresses are given equal credit in the movie, Taapsee shares how much she wanted to do a film based on this concept of two women leading a film equally. ""I don’t know about Bhumi (Pednekar), but right from the start I wanted to do a film with two heroines given equal credit, leading it equally. We have multiple heroines, but they whine for the same guy, we have that kind of stuff. I really wanted to do a film that resonated with Indian women, having two girls with equal screen space. Like nobody could point a finger and say that this one had a better role than the other. Bhumi (Pednekar) and I delved into it knowing that either people will remember us for a long time, or they’ll just mock us. I don’t remember when was the last time a female-oriented film was released on Diwali when you actually worship Laxmi on that day.""

""I hope this film changes a lot, not just for the people who are involved in it but also the trend should change ke agar female-driven film hai toh uska budget kam rakho. Female-driven hai toh big dates pe na release karo ya bade hero ki film ke saath na release karo, because these are the things that we are constantly hearing every single day."" Getting along like a house on fire with co-star Bhumi Pednekar, there are speculations whether the girls are putting on an act or do they genuinely get along well. ""Bhumi and I have not known each other before this film and a very inherent respect came in from my side when I heard that she accepted to do the film in the first go without thinking too much about it. From the start of the workshops, we had all those lovey-dovey moods exchange with each other. We knew that whatever the result may be, this experience that we shared, we are going to talk about it for years. We were there for each other on the set, understanding that we were different types of actors. Because we knew we were in for a bigger purpose, we didn’t really have the time to have any petty issues among us. We are two different individuals, she is the Mumbai-chick and once she starts posing, she’s like a full-on super model kind of poser and I am more like full smile candid type of person going in all directions. We are very contrast as human beings, and I think that is what works because then we have our individual space which doesn’t cross. So we get very comfortable with each other. And it is not like we chill together every day or go watch movies every day, but when we meet we don’t feel any air of competition between us,"" explains Taapsee about her equation with Bhumi. Ask her about her interests in choosing roles which most of the time sends a strong message to the audience and the Naam Shabana actress says, ""I have lived a very regular, normal childhood and I think a basic normal childhood is much underrated these days. I have the most conventional, regular upbringing from a middle call household. I have seen the life of a regular middle-class girl from as basic point of view as possible. I am not saying I have had hardships on which I could write a book or something nor I was born with a silver spoon. So it has been a very nice relative mid-space and that is why I connect very well to an average Indian woman because I am that average Indian woman. I pick up these roles and I connect them with my real life and that is why the roles seem too real or believable."" Touted as one of the most successful and talented actresses in Bollywood today, Taapsee shares that there was a time when she was called a bad luck charm in the South industry. Laughing about it now, she says, ""I was called a bad luck charm when I worked in the South industry during the start of my career. I still know all those portals or newspapers or the people who said all those nasty things, talking about not to take the bad luck charm in their films. But I don’t like going back to them and confronting them about what they said it. It is more like I would make such a situation where you will eat your words one day. I am vindictive, but in a different way, in a progressive way. Having a showdown or confronting is very cheesy and an act of small-time revenge. The bigger revenge is when you turn the tables in such a way that the person has to eat his or her own words, that is more gratifying. And it does happen now. Obviously, they don’t say all those things that they said before, now they are very appreciative of the fact that I have made a mark where a lot of actresses from the South couldn’t. Those people acknowledging this fact is in a way my revenge (laughs)."" Having been called a ‘sasti copy of Kangana Ranaut’ by her sister Rangoli, Taapsee laughs when you ask her about her equation with the sisters. “I think Rangoli and Kangana really love me because of the enormous time and attention they give me. Hats off to them because I don’t give them that amount of time and attention. I must really matter a lot to them (laughs). I would never waste time on someone in my life who doesn’t matter to me or who I don’t like. If I don’t like someone, my biggest answer is – indifference. I feel privileged sometimes because they invest so much time and efforts on me, which clearly I don’t reciprocate. I mean I have never done anything! I have only said hello to Kangana once at the Pink screening. I didn’t even say bye because I couldn’t meet her after the screening. Love and hate, both come out of a heart, so I have made space in their hearts which is very amusing for me because I do not know what I have done to gain that. Kangana was a good actor, she is a good actor and she will remain a good actor as long as she does good movies. Just because she and her sister don’t like me, changes nothing for me because they don’t matter to me. What irks a bully more is when you don’t respond, so that is what I do. They are just digging a hole for themselves and getting into it more and more. I’m still getting wonderful films, good roles. I am getting love from the audience for doing the kind of work I am doing, nothing is changing in my life, I am totally unaffected because of them. Kangana and I, we both have strong opinions. In fact, a lot of others have strong opinions, and it is not a patent. I still hold her in high regards in terms of her professional skills, but that is it. As a human being I don’t think I look up to her for anything. This is not something that I shy away from because, again, this is not something that is going to harm me. This is just going to make her start talking and say things again. And again I am not going to reply to that either."" - with inputs by Saad Abbasi "

Kanpur,"Murder of Hindu outfit leader 'blasphemy killing', 6 held","LUCKNOW: Twenty-four hours after one of the appellants in the Ayodhya title suit, Kamlesh Tiwari, was murdered at noon in his office-cum-residence in Lucknow, a joint team of Uttar Pradesh Police and Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad claimed it had solved the case by blowing the lid off a radicalised Islamist group in Surat, who engineered what might be the first blasphemy killing in India. Tiwari, who was the president of Hindu Samaj Party and earlier working president of the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, was on the radar of extremist Muslim groups since 2015 after he distributed pamphlets with objectionable content against Prophet Mohammed. Five people, including three alleged conspirators - among them a cleric - in Surat and two clerics from Bijnor, were arrested on Saturday. Late in the evening, the Anti-Terrorism Squad of Maharashtra police arrested a man from Nagpur over the murder. The two who allegedly executed the murder are still on the run. The three 'conspirators' have been identified as 24-year-old cleric and 'mastermind' Maulana Mohsin Sheikh, Faizaan, 21, and Rasheed Pathan, 23. Though Gujarat ATS declared names of the assassins as Moinuddin and Ashfaq, UP police kept their identities under wraps. The two Bijnor clerics, Mohammed Mufti Naeem Qazmi and Imam Maulana Anuwarual Haq, who in 2015 had declared a Rs 1.5-crore bounty to kill Tewari, were interrogated by IG (Moradabad range) Ramit Sharma and later arrested. The two clerics were named in the FIR lodged by Kamlesh's wife, Kiran Tewari, on Friday. The Surat gang is said to have been indoctrinated by Mohsin Sheikh, and the murder plan was hatched two months ago with a specific rider to launch lethal strikes during the festive season to extract maximum mileage. It was a box of sweets purchased from a Surat confectionery shop, Dharti Sweet Mart, that helped sleuths crack the case. Talking to reporters on Saturday, Uttar Pradesh director general of police OP Singh said, ""We shared details and clues with our Gujarat counterparts. The accused were identified by matching the CCTV footage from the Surat shop, where they were caught on camera purchasing sweets at 9 pm on October 16, the time mentioned in the cash memo recovered from the sweet box at the crime scene.

NGT norms specify that construction sites must control dust by raising barricades around the site, mounting green net on the building to prevent dust mixing in the atmosphere and by sprinkling water to suppress dust in air. According to rules, a penalty of Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 can be imposed on the violators. In a reality check on Friday, TOI found construction sites in prominent areas like Jankipuram, Gomtinagar, Niralanagar, Alambagh and Aashiana among others flouting the norms. None of them was covered with green sheets or barricades. There was no sprinkling of water at the sites to settle the dust.

The highway authority has been given 15 days to deposit the money with the Public Works Department (PWD), failing which a recovery certificate will be issued against it.

He added that despite several letters and verbal reminders to NHAI officials, no repair work had been carried out and no funds had been made available either to the PWD. Pandey subsequently directed the PWD to conduct a survey of roads and submit a report on the amount needed for repairs, after which the department gave an estimate of Rs 14 crore. Based on the report, the district magistrate said if the amount was not deposited by the NHAI in the next 15 days, a recovery certificate will be issued against it. In case there’s no action even after that, arrest warrants would be against the officials concerned, he said. In August, Pandey had constituted a district road control committee with an aim to bring about transparency and coordination between departments like NHAI, PWD, Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and others.

Lucknow,"Uttar Pradesh: Biker jumps railway crossing, close shave for Tejas","LUCKNOW: A reckless biker who ignored drop gates at a manned level crossing near Unnao on Saturday night not only risked his own life, but also those of a few hundred passengers of Tejas Express. As the youth jumped off his two-wheeler perilously close to the rails to escape unscathed in the nick of time, the train grazed the front wheel of the bike. Fortunately, it didn't jump tracks. A case under Sections 153 and 147 of The Railways Act has been lodged against the biker for trespassing and endangering the life of passengers. Divisional railway manager (Northern Railway) Sanjay Tripathi told TOI the mishap took place around 11pm when Tejas Express was on its return journey from Delhi to Lucknow. No injury has been reported, he said. ""It is a standard practice to drop barriers at a level crossing when a train is approaching. The biker in question breached the barrier and was crossing the tracks when the train came within sniffing distance. He abandoned his bike on the side of the tracks and ran to safety.

Lucknow,Bypolls to 11 seats today: BJP buoyed by split opposition,"LUCKNOW: Battle lines have been drawn in 11assembly seats which would go for bypolls on Monday. Riding high on its spectacular performance in Lok Sabha elections, BJP and its ally Apna Dal, which had bagged nine of the 11 seats in the 2017 UP assembly elections, would undergo another acid test given their poor performance in 2018 UP bypolls when they were defeated by a combined Opposition. This time, however, BJP faces a fractured Opposition with SP and BSP breaking their alliance and Congress going alone. The assembly seats going to bypolls are Gangoh, Rampur, Iglas (SC), Lucknow Cantonment, Govindnagar, Manikpur, Pratapgarh, Zaidpur (SC), Jalalpur, Balha (SC) and Ghosi. The bypolls have been necessitated following the election of eight BJP and one each of SP and BSP MLAs to the Lok Sabha. The Ghosi seat fell vacant after BJP MLA Phagu Chauhan was elevated to the post of Bihar governor. While the BJP pushed its entire organizational machinery led by CM Yogi Adityanath and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh in the battlefield, SP and BSP largely stayed away from any hectic campaigning. It was only in Rampur, the stronghold of senior SP leader and MP Azam Khan, that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav went to campaign for party candidate and Azam’s wife Tazeen Fatima.

The results would also be projection of the strength of Congress, which has undergone a churning from top to bottom in the state. "
Lucknow,"Kamlesh Tewari murder case: Amid calm &amp; angst, probe picks up pace","LUCKNOW: After a 45-minute tryst with UP chief minister early Sunday, the tragedy struck family of right-wing leader Kamlesh Tewari walked out of 5 Kalidas Marg with a sense of calm after a slew of assurances from Yogi Adityanath. In an exclusive conversation with TOI, Tewari’s eldest son Satyam expressed satisfaction at the pace of probe, but put a rider. “If the killers are not nabbed in 10 days, NIA should take over the probe. If police have hit upon so many clues and operational details, why are killers still not in their net,” he asked. However, the calm in the Tewari family proved deceptive and by the time they reached their native village in Sitapur, mother Kusum had another outburst against the government. While sparks flew as the grieving mother spoke to reporters, an explosive video of Tewari crying betrayal by the saffron brigade went viral on social media. Speaking to TOI, Satyam said, “I don’t know anything about the Surat gang. I only know they posed as friends, ate ‘dahi bada’ and then brutally murdered my father. Our security has been beefed up, but I am having sleepless nights. Just days before my father was killed, he spoke about multiple threats to his life, but police did not upgrade his security. I last spoke to him on Thursday night. He enquired about my health and studies and said he would come to Sitapur on Sunday to meet me.” NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Referring to his grandmother Kusum Tewari’s allegation of a BJP leader’s hand in the murder, Satyam told TOI, “She is in trauma and hence took the name of a local BJP leader. We have a land dispute with him, but he cannot dare kill my father.” Standing few metres away, Kusum expressed dissatisfaction after meeting the chief minister. She said as per Hindu custom, a family in grief does not venture out for 13 days after cremation, but police forcibly took her to meet the CM. “I wanted to meet the CM to ask him why my son’s security was downgraded and why he was brutally killed. Police took me to meet him under duress. Nothing happened as per my wish. I am still seething in anger and won’t hesitate to pick up the sword, if we don’t get justice,” she said. Besides, a video of Kamlesh Tewari went viral on Sunday, which his son Satyam confirmed to TOI that it was indeed his father’s voice and recorded by him. In the video, Kamlesh is heard saying, “I am deeply pained. For 30 years, I sacrificed my youth, went to jail, campaigned to awaken Hindus, but still BJP IT Cell and people of Sangh Parivar are calling me a Congressman. I always fought for Hindus and even questioned Mahatma Gandhi and wanted to build a temple of Nathuram Godse. Muslims abuse me, but I am pained when some Hindus call me a Congressman due to political compulsions. My heart bleeds. I put my own life and family in danger. The Samajwadi Party government had given me a security cover of 12-13 personnel, but this government stripped my security to just one gunner. This proves that since Muslims want to kill me, they have also become part of the conspiracy. They want me to eliminate me so that no strong Hindu leader lives to speak.” "

Lucknow,My family treats me like Goddess Lakshmi: Madirakshi Mundle,"Actress Madirakshi Mundle, better known as Siya from Siya Ke Ram, was recently in Lucknow and Kanpur to promote her latest show on TV. Madirakshi, who plays goddess Lakshmi in a show, says she is happy doing mythological shows on television. ""To be frank, I don’t mind being typecast in the mythological genre. What’s wrong in that?"" questions she, adding, ""For me it is a blessing playing such characters. I belong to a pandit family. From childhood only, I have heard stories of god and goddesses. And now I am playing a goddess on screen. So for me and my family it is actually a very big thing to play such characters. I have actually become a goddess for my family, especially for my mamaji and nani ji. Whenever I visit my hometown Indore, they treat me like Goddess Lakhsmi and Sita. My family says they believe a goddess was born in their family."" Madirakshi says she personally tries to do such roles so that people accept her with ease. ""I know there are actors and actress for whom their personal and professional image is different. But for me, I come from the same mindset, where I think, that the audience will not accept me in a role of a goddess if I do a saas-bahu show now. But this is me. Jo hamari Indian audience hai, woh kaafi emotional hai aaj bhi inn characters ko le ke. If today while playing Sita or Lakhmi, if I post pictures in a bikini, the audience will not accept me. Kafi controversies ho jayengi. I keep all these things in mind. Like for example, people on the Lucknow airport were addressing me as Sita ji or they were worshipping me as Lakshmi, iska matlab yeh hai ki they can relate to my character. So what is the harm in staying a bit sensitive towards such emotions?"" So we wonder if these are the only shows which are being offered to her? ""No, no! I am being offered all kinds of roles, especially negative ones. But filhaal, I don’t want to play a vamp.

Lucknow,Kamlesh Tewari killers remain a blip on cop radar,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday announced Rs 5 lakh reward for clues that could lead to the arrest of Moinuddin Pathan and Ashfaq, the two killers of right-wing leader Kamlesh Tewari. Also, police released photographs of the killer duo late evening after whisking away the three conspirators from Surat - Maulana Sheikh, Faizan and Rashid Pathan - to the Anti-Terrorist Squad headquarters in Sarojininagar after they were flown down to Lucknow on transit remand from Gujarat. The trio, who was interrogated for 10 hours, will be produced in court on Tuesday. A team of Lucknow police was dispatched to Nagpur late evening to bring another alleged key conspirator, Sayyed Asim Ali, on transit remand. Ali was detained by Maharashtra ATS on Saturday after phone surveillance revealed that one of the killers, Moinuddin, called him after executing the murder. Investigators have also found that the pistol used in the crime was arranged by a friend of Ashfaq, who is on the radar of Gujarat ATS. Mobile surveillance had traced the location of the killer duo outside a private hospital in Bareilly late Saturday after which there was no blip on the tracking network. Earlier, the duo was electronically tracked in Shahjahanpur and also caught on CCTV outside a hotel near a railway station on night of October 18, but they managed to slip away before cops could collate data to zero in on their exact location.

Lucknow,Lucknow lungs blackest in India on Monday,"LUCKNOW: Air pollution level worsened in Lucknow on Monday, making it the most polluted in the country on the day.

As per the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board, the pollution levels in Lucknow were recorded to be 294, just six-unit less to push the air level to ‘very polluted’ category, which is termed a situation of health emergency.

The increase in index means that the concentration of superfine particulate matter, PM2.5, in the air has increased rapidly. Environmentalists attribute the rapid rise to the festive rush leading to increase in vehicular load on roads and favourable climatic conditions turning city into a gas chamber. “The speed with which the pollution levels are rising is worrying. If these levels continue then post-Diwali conditions would be stressful for people’s health ,” said LU climate and air monitoring cell director Prof Dhruvsen Singh. He said the main reason behind bad air is the prevailing cloudy conditions for the last three days which are preventing solar radiation to reach earth and pollutants to disperse from earth to space.

According to the DM’s office, the names of 1,884 children were recommended for admission under the RTE Act, but only 1,280 were admitted to schools. Under the Act, the state government provides education to underprivileged kids free of cost at CBSE schools.

What followed was an array of hateful hashtags in mockery and insult for the Prophet which took over social media as soon as news of Tewari's murder broke.

The easterlies is leading to fast dispersion of the pollutants,” said Utsav Sharma, environment engineer, UPPCB, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad.

GRAP measures to curb air pollution include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping the use of diesel gensets when the air quality turns “poor”. When it turns “severe”, GRAP suggests the closure of brick kilns, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised road cleaning and maximising power generation from natural gas. “In addition to ground level controls and weather conditions, what has also made a difference this year is reduction in construction activity in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad,” Sharma said.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Man held in ‘encounter’ was handed to cops three days earlier,"GHAZIABAD: On October 17, residents of Vaishali’s Sector 3 manage to nab Akash during a robbery attempt. But police records from three days later, October 20, state Akash was arrested during an ‘encounter’ with cops at a check post in the Indirapuram area. How did a man who was handed over to police come to be arrested in a purported encounter? And if he indeed was, how did he go free? The credibility of police claims on ‘encounters’ is being questioned on social media forums with videos that local residents had shot of the capture of Akash on October 17. The residents have confronted police with evidence to point out that their claim of nabbing Akash during an ‘encounter’ was dubious; among other things, Akash is seen wearing the same clothes on the day of his capture on October 17 and the photograph released by police after the ‘encounter’ on October 20. On October 17, Akash and one of his associates were in the Vaishali area to commit a robbery. They targeted a locked house in Sector 3 in the afternoon and were caught red-handed. Mobile camera footage of his capture shows Akash wearing blue denims and a full-sleeve yellow round-neck vest with a vertical blue stripe to the left that has ‘Under Armour’ written in white.

A neighbour who thought he heard hammer blows came out to check and raised the alarm. When people searched their bag, they found a screwdriver, a small hammer and other tools,” a resident involved in Akash’s capture said. However, in a note released on October 20, police claimed to have apprehended Akash while he and an associate were on a scooter. Police claimed the two had fired at the cops after they were asked to stop. A photo that the police subsequently released of their successful mission shows Akash, clad in the same yellow vest and blue denims, standing next to his ‘captors’ in khaki. Police described Akash as one of the accused in the murder of Pankaj Dhawan (30), a pharmacist with a private firm, in his house in Govindpuram. On August 30, some men had entered Dhawan’s house when he was sleeping and his mother had gone to the market. Dhawan’s mother had locked the house from outside, but the men managed to break in. Police said burglary was the motive and Dhawan had been beaten to death when the burglars found the house wasn’t empty. Deepak Sharma, SHO of Indirapuram police station, and other senior officers in Ghaziabad police, issued a statement that police got leads from reliable sources about the movement of two suspicious persons and set up a check post in the Indirapuram area. When their scooter was stopped, Akash and his associate Sunny allegedly started firing at the cops. Return fire from the cops injured Sunny and Akash was arrested after a search operation, the police statement said. But with videos of Akash’s capture in Vaishali emerging on social media, police were on the back foot. Ghaziabad SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh said Akash was let off to “trap” his other associates, and three days later, he and his accomplice were indeed caught. “Police released him to know the whereabouts of the other accused in the Pankaj Dhawan murder case, Sunny and Salman,” he said.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad roadside houses may be allowed commerial activity,"GHAZIABAD: Commercial activity could soon be allowed in all ground-floor housing units located by the roadside across the city. A proposal to this effect has been sent to the state government for its approval. Currently, the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) allows commercial activity only on six streets, also called ‘Bazar Streets’ — Hapur Road to Rail Road, Ghanta Ghar to Rail Road, Turabnagar to Ramteram Road, Delhi Gate to Dasna, Ghanta Ghar to Sihani Gate and a street near Old Bus Adda. “An internal survey has revealed that commercial activity is going on in 90% of residential areas that fall by the roadside. This is called ‘ribbon development’. Though it is illegal, GDA cannot do much about it given the sheer magnitude of such cases,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief town planner, GDA. “It was felt that it would be better to regulate ‘ribbon development’ in a manner which would help generate substantial revenues,” he added.

It will be mandatory for the road width in front of the residential-cum-commercial units to be 80 feet or more. “There has to be parking space in the front and only 30% of FAR of such units can be used for commercial activities,” said Shivpuri. Beneficiaries will also have to pay ‘impacst fee’, which will be 25% of the existing circle rate of the area, he added. If the proposal is cleared, the six ‘Bazar Streets’ will come under its ambit too, said Shivpuri. In 2001, the state government had introduced the Adarsh Zoning Regulation, under which it had allowed commercial activities under mixed land use in certain areas while in others it was not allowed. “After 2008, ‘ribbon development’ became more pronounced and many dwellers by the roadside started commercial activity in one form or the other. Since it is happening all over the city, a way needed to be found to regulate it,” said Shivpuri. "

I remember once, on the day after Diwali, when I lit the gas burner in our kitchen, instead of a blue flame, there was an orange flame. Intrigued, I asked my dad why was this happening and he told me that it was due to the high content of carbon dioxide in the air which was causing the flame to turn orange. It was so scary to think that I couldn’t be safe even in my own house because of this gas. So after that, we never burst crackers on Diwali.""

Kanpur,Uttar Pradesh bypolls: BJP retains its Govind Nagar stronghold,"KANPUR: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) successfully retained its Govind Nagar stronghold in the bypoll after its candidate Surendra Maithani, who got 50.08% votes, was declared the winner on Thursday. It was an early Diwali for Maithani, his supporters and the party workers, who burst crackers and exchanged sweets to celebrate the victory.

Maithani, who is the city unit president of the party, has been elected MLA for the first time. Maithani, who polled 60,215 votes, defeated his nearest rival Karishma Thakur of Congress by a margin of 21,224 votes. Karishma polled 38,991 votes. Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate Samrat Vikas stood at the third place with 11,912 votes and BSP candidate Devi Prasad Tiwari was at the fourth place with 5,430 votes. The elated party workers burnt firecrackers, played with colours and offered sweets to each other. Congratulatory messages started pouring in for Maithani soon after his victory. Talking to TOI, Maithani said, “I am thankful to the voters of Govind Nagar constituency for posing faith in me by voting for me. I am determined to work for them and do the development of the constituency. The damaged and dilapidated roads would be repaired soon and all issues concerned which the common man will be raised in the assembly.” Congress candidate Karishma Thakur, who stood second in the bypoll, thanked voters for placing trust in her. “I am not dejected because I secured more than 30,000 votes and stood second. Low polling and lack of support from some Congress workers were the reasons behind my defeat, she alleged. Top party leaders--Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi--are aware of the game played by some party workers due to which she lost, she said. Had the party workers convinced women, voters, to vote for her, the situation would have been different, she added. Among the nine contestants, Surendra Katiyar was at the ninth place with only 174 votes while NOTA was at the sixth place with 1,004 voters opting for it. As expected, Maithani was leading from the very first round getting 2,455 votes out of 4,416 votes polled. While Karishma was behind him with 1,493 votes, SP candidate Samrat Vikas at the third place with 274 votes and Devi Prasad Tiwari of BSP at the fourth place with 139 votes. The BJP candidate increased his lead against his rivals in each round and by the end of the 10th round, Maithani was leading with 22,167 votes while Karishma stood at the second place with 13,407 votes. After the 20th round, Maithani was leading with 15,518 votes against Karishma, who by that time had polled 31,904 votes while Maithani got 47,422 votes and it became evident that he would emerge the winner.

Lucknow,BJP returning as largest party in Haryana is a big feat: PM,"LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday hailed BJP’s performance in Maharashtra and Haryana, pointing out that the party had never led or returned a government to office in the western state and had usually been a bit player in the other. Looking to settle the suspense over government formation in Haryana, Modi said BJP would re-dedicate itself to running the small but volatile state. “Usually, we had to accept whatever was offered to us. If we crossed 10 seats, it was a major achievement. Emerging as the largest party is very creditable,” he said, recalling his experience as a party functionary.

Modi’s praise for CM Manohar Lal Khattar, who he said had successfully walked a tightrope having a two-seat majority to begin with in 2014, makes it clear that the leader will continue to be the party’s nominee for the post. The PM noted that both states were led by leaders who had not had much administrative experience and had nevertheless made their mark. “Manohar Lal Khattar and Devendra Fadnavis had no administrative experience before they took over as chief ministers in 2014. They were not even ministers in any government,” he said.

The PM said though political pundits were busy analysing trends emerging from the two states, the victory in Haryana was unprecedented as return of a party after five years was rare in politics. “In an atmosphere when governments are changing, BJP emerging as single largest party in the state is a huge feat,” Modi said, adding that the vote share in Haryana had increased to 36%. BJP president and home minister Amit Shah emphasised that Haryana and Maharashtra were not traditional strongholds with BJP’s win in the 2014 Lok Sabha changing the situation. “Both CMs delivered corruption free governments and their return to office is people’s endorsement of their performance,” he said.

Ghaziabad,"Noida, Ghaziabad get nodal officer to curb green woes","NOIDA: Growing environmental concerns in western UP, particularly in the Noida-Ghaziabad-Agra-Meerut belt, have compelled the state government to appoint a nodal officer in Okhla. The senior officer, deputed as chief engineer (Yamuna), would speed up compliance and disposal of pending issues regarding pollution in the Yamuna, Hindon and Krishna, bringing air pollution under control, and ensuring protection of river regulation zone among other issues. The order issued on Wednesday by the state government mentions 15 important National Green Tribunal (NGT) cases, of which seven pertain to Noida. Expected to coordinate closely with key officials posted in different departments, the nodal officer would expedite pending matters before the NGT on behalf of the UP government as well. In the past, NGT had pulled up the state government time and again for not following the stipulated timeline in disposing issues. “Senior officials such as chief secretary and principal secretaries of different departments are often summoned to Delhi for explanation. A lot of times they do not understand the local issues that well but have to represent the state government. Having a dedicated official in Noida would be helpful,” a senior officer of the irrigation department told TOI.

I would take up pending issues under the irrigation department on a priority basis,” said Anil Kumar, chief engineer (Yamuna), Okhla. The government order also mentions a report published by TOI in 2018 (National Air Clean Programme with multiple timelines to clean air in 102 cities) and directs Kumar to check what steps have been taken to improve air quality across eight cities in Uttar Pradesh. Advocate Dhairya Gupta who took up case of Sector 41 Noida resident Monika Srivastava before the NGT, said, “We had taken up the issue of pollution in stormwater drains in Noida due to incessant dumping of garbage and untreated sewage as well as untreated discharge of effluents. Officials at Noida Authority submitted photographs of just one instance when they had cleaned up the drains and that was it. The drains remain choked again.” Gupta said he would file a review petition to press for some mechanism through which citizens would have the option of reviewing the work done by Authority. “In Delhi, the municial corporation has launched vehicle tracking system through which citizen can check the location of sewage cleaning vehicle online. The Noida Authority also can set up such services for citizens,” said Gupta. "
Ghaziabad,Shift toll 1km towards Delhi to end UP Gate snarls: Traffic cops to GDA,"GHAZIABAD: The traffic police has written to the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and the district administration, urging them to request authorities in Delhi to shift the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) toll plaza in Ghazipur one km towards Delhi side, as the current location creates a bottleneck for vehicles at UP Gate. Officials said the letter was sent after a traffic survey found that due to long queues at the toll plaza, a one km jam ensues during peak hours. As a result, commuters travelling from places like Mohan Nagar, Khora and Hindon elevated road often get stuck at UP Gate — a border point with Delhi, near Ghazipur — for an hour. “The MCD is charging only commercial vehicles for entry into Delhi from Ghaziabad. Each vehicle takes an averga of one minute to cross the plaza and if over 30 cars are in the queue, then the situation of traffic becomes worst. Private cars also get stuck due to this and the tailback extends to the UP Gate,” said traffic inspector Pramhansh Tiwari. Latest CommentIsn''t there an easier way out?

So, in the letter to the GDA and the administration, we have requested them to ask the Delhi authorities to shift the toll plaza one km towards Delhi or somewhere near Akshardham, which is the best location,” he added. Commuters said it’s high time that the GDA takes a call on the relocation of the toll plaza to put an end to snarls at UP Gate once and for all. “It does take over an hour to cross UP Gate during peak hours in the morning. At the time of setting up of the toll plaza, the authorities should have thought about the traffic problem. Now, it’s the responsibility of the GDA to solve this problem,” Narayan Singh, a resident of Indirapuram, said.

Kanpur,No clean sweep: BJP wins come with a scare,"With Samajwadi Party registering victories in 3 of 11 assembly constituencies and bouncing back as a formidable force, the bypoll results in Uttar Pradesh largely drew the roadmap for the 2022 electoral battle between BJP and a resurgent Samajwadi Party. The ruling BJP and its ally Apna Dal have had to be content with eight seats, managing to retain Gangoh in west UP by the skin of its teeth. In other words, the 2022 mother of all battles is all set to witness a direct contest between chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his key opponent and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, retaining the traditional Muslim-Yadav support base and also succeeding in wooing Dalits. For BSP chief Mayawati, bypoll results proved that her unilateral decision to part ways with Samajwadi Party was rejected by her core supporters, who have begun shifting loyalties towards Samajwadi Party. And this was proved by the way SP breached BSP’s traditional fortress of Jalalabad in Ambedkar Nagar, once represented by Mayawati herself. BSP not only lost deposits in six seats, but was pushed to the third position in three constituencies. Though Congress drew a blank, it drew solace from a significant rise in vote share in at least six constituencies. This came as a booster dose for the cadre of the grand old party being steered in the state by AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and newly-appointed state party chief Ajay Kumar Lallu.

In 2018, the ruling party lost all three bypolls to Lok Sabha, including Yogi’s pocket borough of Gorakhpur. The BJP leadership, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath and newly-appointed state president Swatantra Dev Singh had repeatedly talked about a clean sweep in face of a split Opposition, but the ground realities proved different. To bag 11constituencies, the chief minister deployed one minister for every constituency, including deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma in Rampur and party chief Swatantra Dev Singh himself led the campaign. BJP candidates slipped to the third position in two constituencies, including Jalalpur, where senior minister Brijesh Pathak was in-charge. Even the eight seats bagged by BJP, the victories were not convincing. Its candidate scraped past an independent candidate Sudhakar Singh by 1,700 votes in Ghosi. The SP candidate’s papers had been rejected by Election Commission so the party backed the independent candidate, who pushed BJP to the edge till the result was announced. In the Gangoh seat in Saharanpur, Congress candidate Noman Masood was winning till the 27th round when BJP candidate Kirat Singh Chaudhary suddenly zoomed ahead and was declared winner, triggering allegations of rigging by Congress leaders. In Manikpur in Chitrakoot and Govind Nagar in Kanpur, where BJP won, the margins were lower, when compared to 2017 assembly elections. While chief minister Yogi Adityanath campaigned in all 11 constituencies, SP president Akhilesh Yadav remained hands off, barring addressing rallies for Azam Khan’s wife in Rampur. Despite this, SP candidates bagged Zaidpur in Barabanki and Jalalpur in Ambedkar Nagar and lost Ghosi by a razor-thin margin, indicating a revival. Latest Commentdays are numberedRewardingSee All CommentsAdd commentBSP however appears to be losing ground, moreso not after breaking its historic alliance with SP even after winning 10 seats in Lok Sabha elections. Besides, BSP supremo Mayawati’s softening stance on triple talaq law, Article 370 dilution and a muted criticism of BJP government on key issues, dented the confidence of cadres and supporters. BSP had also come third in Hamipur byelection, falling behind SP on second spot while BJP won the seat. With no more electoral fights in sight, the state will now head towards the 2022 battle of ballot, and the key players, including the ruling Saffron brigade will have to rethink and redraw their strategies.

Kanpur,Dramatic drop in BJP vote share in Uttar Pradesh bypolls from 2017,"LUCKNOW: BJP and its ally Apna Dal may have retained eight of 11 seats in the bypolls, but an analysis shows the saffron party's vote share dramatically dipped from 46.09% in 2017 assembly elections to 35.6% this time. This was a setback despite BJP facing a fractured opposition in wake of SP and BSP parting ways after Lok Sabha elections, while Congress preferring to go solo. In contrast, it was Samajwadi Party which emerged as the key opposition to BJP by raising its vote share from around 17.13% in 2017, when it entered into an alliance with Congress, to over 22% this time. In 2017, SP did not contest on four seats, including Iglas, Zaidpur, Manikpur and Govindnagar. The same was true of Congress, whose vote share catapulted from 9.05% in 2017 to 11.49% in the bypolls. The rise in vote percentage may mark a resurgence of Congress fortunes after the recent churning in its organisational structure led by Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu.

Lucknow,Dramatic drop in BJP vote share in Uttar Pradesh bypolls from 2017,"LUCKNOW: BJP and its ally Apna Dal may have retained eight of 11 seats in the bypolls, but an analysis shows the saffron party's vote share dramatically dipped from 46.09% in 2017 assembly elections to 35.6% this time. This was a setback despite BJP facing a fractured opposition in wake of SP and BSP parting ways after Lok Sabha elections, while Congress preferring to go solo. In contrast, it was Samajwadi Party which emerged as the key opposition to BJP by raising its vote share from around 17.13% in 2017, when it entered into an alliance with Congress, to over 22% this time. In 2017, SP did not contest on four seats, including Iglas, Zaidpur, Manikpur and Govindnagar. The same was true of Congress, whose vote share catapulted from 9.05% in 2017 to 11.49% in the bypolls. The rise in vote percentage may mark a resurgence of Congress fortunes after the recent churning in its organisational structure led by Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu.

Lucknow,UP: Auto sales dip by 30% on festival,"LUCKNOW: Automakers went all out to propel fortunes on Dhanteras with historic discounts, but their strategy failed to fire up car sales as euphoria among buyers was missing this festive season. Auto sales in the state capital plummeted by 30% as compared to last year as the industry reeled from the effects of a slowdown, Centre's push for electric vehicles and myths over BS6 norms. Bharat Stage 6 - also called BS6 - is a standard of emission norms set by the Union government. BS6 norms will come into effect by April next year and automakers will need to upgrade their engine. Therefore, some customers have postponed their purchase. With consumers dithering to visit showrooms, companies offered all-time high discounts per vehicle to arrest the slump in sales. However, the sales witnessed a slide on Dhanteras, which marks the beginning of Diwali festivities and is believed to be an auspicious day to enhance your wealth. One of India's multinational auto manufacturing firms witnessed a 30% drop in sales despite lucrative discounts from Rs 80,000 to Rs 1.70 lakh. Another leading carmaker offered tempting discounts between Rs 30,000 and 45,000, yet buyer sentiments continued to be low and the firm registered a 32% plunge in sales - the worst in its history.

All attempts to woo car buffs with discounts going up to Rs 3 lakh and free insurance failed, as the sales saw a 20% decline compared to 2018. Speaking about the effect of BS6 confusion on market, Federation of Automobile Dealers' Associations CEO Saharsh Damani said: ""If historic discounts failed to bring flagging auto sales into the fast lane, it's a big question if consumers will be able to afford BS6-compliant cars, which will come with a higher price tag."" The buyer sentiment was not limited to brand new cars alone. Lucknow Car Dealers' Association president Sanjeev Sahni said: ""It has also affected the market of used cars. We sold over 200 second-hand cars during this time last year. However, it drastically came down to 40 this Dhanteras."" In 2018, sales of cars and bikes in the city was dented by fuel price hike and insurance rates. The demand fizzled out as sales dived 50% compared to 2017. "

Banned crackers were openly sold and used in many parts of the city on the eve of Diwali. It has also come to the fore that the authorities have just one mobile unit to patrol the entire 2,528sqkm area of the city and take offenders to task. TimesViewImmersion of idols after Durga Puja in artificial ponds instead of in the river was considered impossible till a few years ago out of fear of hurting religious sentiments. However, this was done successfully by spreading awareness and by public participation. The same can be done with the sale and use of fire crackers that cause both noise and air pollution. The administration needs to make people aware through various programmes and at the same time, crack a whip on those selling and using banned crackers.NEWS IN BRIEFEXPLORE BRIEFSAmid Covid surge, Centre's 5-step containment strategy for statesIndia witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday held a meeting with officials from 12 worst-hit states and presented a five-fold containment strategy to bring the situation under control.Over 60 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 64 people - including a young boy - on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, even as the ruling junta's leader said the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.The order categorically mentions that since noisy crackers like bombs and chatai (small crackers stringed together like a mat) cause health problems, these are being prohibited. The administration, quoting from a 2001 Supreme Court order, further states that all crackers above 125dB and those emitting excess smoke or chemicals are banned. Doctors say the human ear can tolerate a noise level up to 85dB, beyond which it causes discomfort, while noise above 125dB is harmful. Similarly, chemicals like lead, mercury, lithium and chromium used in firecrackers cause lung problems. The order, which fixed a two-hour window (8pm to 10pm) for bursting of crackers on Diwali, also warned that offenders would be booked under Section 188 of the IPC, which prescribes a six-month jail term. Nevertheless, TOI found high-decibel crackers — including desi bomb and chatai — being sold at various markets in Aishbagh, Yahiyaganj, Niralanagar and Kakori, among others. City magistrate Girjesh Chaudhari initially denied such violation, but later maintained that police had been instructed to identify offenders and enforce guidelines while the UP Pollution Control Board would measure noise levels and act against violators. On use of banned crackers, ASP (East) Suresh Chandra said, “All circle officers are the nodal officer monitoring the sale of crackers in their areas. Nobody has been caught selling or using illegal crackers so far.” Other senior police officers in-charge of various zones of the city had similar response. Amit Chandra, a senior official of UPPCB, too gave a stock reply. “We have a mobile unit that will patrol different parts of the city to check noise levels and inform the administration about violations,” he said.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: Chess player dies as iron rod in hand touches power line,"GHAZIABAD: A FIDE-rated chess player who had been overseeing construction work in his house in Kavi Nagar area was electrocuted on Friday evening when an iron rod he was pulling from the second to the third floor touched an electricity supply line next to the building. The accident occurred around 8pm. At the time, Raj Kumar (42), who also owned a chess academy in Ghaziabad besides being an international arbiter, was standing on the second floor of his house in Govindapuram while the construction work was going on at the third floor, police said. “As he was helping a construction worker pull an iron rod to the third floor, the latter slipped on the staircase and the bar came in touch with a wire carrying 1100 KV of electricity. The current passed through the rod and he was electrocuted,” said Anil Kumar Shahi, Kavi Nagar SHO. Raj Kumar was rushed to a nearby hospital with severe burn injuries, where he succumbed during treatment. “Police investigation is underway. The body has been sent for an autopsy and the report is awaited,” the SHO said. But as news of his death spread in the area, family members and local residents vented out their anger against the power department for “negligence” on its part. “We have given a written complaint to the police to take action against the electricity official in charge of the area. If cops fail to take action, then we will stage a protest against the police and electricity departments,” a family member said. Jai Singh, a resident, said, “Many a time, we have complained about uncovered live electric wires hanging from poles in the area, but power department officials just don’t bother to address our concerns.” Originally from Bihar, Raj Kumar is survived by his wife and two daughters, aged 15 years and 7 years. “Raj Kumar was one of the best rated chess players in India. He was also an international arbiter, a title awarded by Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE),” said Mithilesh Srivastava, a neighbour. Yashvardhan Srivastava, city magistrate, said he had inspected the area and “will soon submit a report to the district magistrate for further action”. “The district administration will also write a letter to the CM to provide financial help to the family as the deceased was the family’s sole breadwinner.” "

Ghaziabad,"You burst fewer crackers this year, but air still as bad as the last time","NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: The air quality in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad worsened on Monday evening post Diwali celebrations, as the index in the cities crossed 400-mark in a span of three hours (4-7pm), which falls in the ‘severe’ category. However, a 24-hour monitoring in these cities till 4pm showed the AQI hovered in the ‘very poor’ range. Though there has been an overall reduction in cracker use this year as compared to last Diwali, the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Department (UPPCB) attributed the sudden deterioration in air quality on Monday evening to a decline in wind speed. Pollution levels are expected to worsen further if weather conditions don’t change in 24 hours.

Last year, the post-Diwali AQI had peaked to 432 in Noida, 410 in Greater Noida and 422 in Ghaziabad. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. “The supply of crackers was low this Diwali, so people could not burst much. So there was no immediate spike in AQI, however a slowing down of dispersion by the evening resulted in the worsening of AQI in these three cities,” Utsav Sharma, environmental engineer at UPPCB (Greater Noida and Ghaziabad), told TOI. Residents also admitted that there was less bursting of crackers this Diwali as compared to the last few years. “Even though cracker bursting this time was less as compared to last year but briefly I did experience some breathing difficulty after 10 pm on Sunday. However, things stabilised around midnight,” said Arvind Mishra, a resident of Vaishali. “In 2017 and 2018, I remember smog enveloping the NCR cities.” Shivangi Mishra, a BA first-year student and resident of Shashtri Nagar, added, “With some amount of guilt, I must admit that I do love bursting crackers. But for the past two years, I have not been able to do so in the manner I would have loved to. And this time it was so dry, anyway pollution was less on this Diwali evening.” “Usually crackers are burst till late in the night. But on Sunday, there were hardly any crackers burst in our neighbourhood. We did get to hear some noise, but they were coming from afar. People must have burst crackers in denser residences,” said Rashmi Singh, a resident of Noida’s Sector 28. “All rules pertaining to graded response action plan (GRAP) related to severe AQI will now be applicable in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad,” Utsav Sharma said. GRAP measures to curb air pollution include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping use of diesel gensets when the air quality turns ‘poor’. When it turns ‘severe’, GRAP suggests closure of brick kilns, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised road cleaning and maximising power generation from natural gas.

Similarly, the AQI levels for neighbouring Noida and Greater Noida on Tuesday stood at 439 and 428, respectively. On Monday, it was 429 in Noida and 404 in Greater Noida.

The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Department (UPPCB) attributed the deterioration in air quality in these three cities to the prevailing weather conditions and farm fires from Haryana and Punjab. Pollution levels could worsen further over the next few days if weather conditions don’t change in 24 hours, officials said. “Graded response action plan (GRAP) measures for ‘severe’ category were implemented a week ahead of Diwali this year. Also construction activity and pollution-prone industrial activities were curbed much ahead of Diwali, but both cracker bursting and stubble burning are responsible for this situation,” said Sharma. As per SAFAR data, stubble fire counts of Haryana and Punjab have increased from 1654 to 2577 in the past 24 hours. “This coupled with meteorological conditions such as surface winds slowing down, especially during night hours, has been aiding accumulation of pollutants like PM10 and PM2.5,” he said. So far, the UPPCB has received no encouraging forecast from the weather department “that could help dissipate apprehensions about the AQI over the next few days”.

Ghaziabad,Karnataka flights from today as Hindon-Hubballi service starts,"GHAZIABAD: A new air route will open up between Delhi and Karnataka on Wednesday when a 50-seater Embraer jet from Hubballi lands at the Hindon air force base’s civil terminal in the afternoon. The thrice-a-week round-trip service under the Centre’s Udan (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) scheme will be operated by private firm Star Air, which will be only the second airline to use the Hindon terminal. Star Air’s Embraer will, however, be the only plane currently operating from here since the other service — to and from Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand operated by Heritage Aviation — has been suspended till the time the plane is fit to fly again. The Star Air service is, therefore, important for the Hindon terminal as it will keep the facility in business. It hasn’t been the smoothest of starts for the terminal that was built to take some load off Delhi’s IGI airport. The terminal hasn’t seen the country’s leading carriers show interest yet because ground realities changed once Jet Airways folded up and slots opened up at IGI. The Heritage flight, suspended twice in the 25 days since the 9-seater Beechcraft has been in operation, has shown how stability and continuity of services under the regional connectivity scheme is difficult to achieve till the bigger players fly in, aviation experts said. Heritage has just one 9-seater Beechcraft King Air 350 in its fleet. Hindon terminal director Shobha Bhardwaj said, “Heritage Airlines had to suspend flight operations twice because of problems with the plane. We hope we will not face a similar problem with Star Airlines on the Hubballi-Hindon route.” But Star Air has a bigger fleet and is more experienced in flying long routes. “Ours is a 50-seater Embraer 145 plane, and under the Udan scheme, this is one of the longest flights by duration in the country. On other routes where we are operating flights, there have been no such instances and we have a proven track record,” Star Air spokesperson Rajkuwar Nimbalkar said. The airline flies eight routes, which include Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. “In terms of fleet strength, it is more stable as compared to Heritage,” said an aviation expert. Star Air flights will operate between Hubballi and the Hindon air base on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, starting November 6. “The fare (under Udan) has been fixed at Rs 3,699 per person and for (the first) two days, occupancy is full,” said Nimbalkar. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, the flight will depart from Hubballi at 1.05pm and arrive here at 3.45pm. The return flight will take off from Hindon at 4.10pm reach Hubballi at 6.50pm. “On Saturdays, the flight will depart from Hubballi at 11.50am and reach Hindon at 2.30pm. It will fly from Hindon at 3pm arrive at Hubballi at 5.40pm,” Nimbalkar said. Star Air is the aviation arm of the Sanjay Ghodawat Group (SGG), which has a presence in several industry segments from agriculture to mining and real estate. The group is headquartered near Kolhapur, Maharashtra. "

Ghaziabad,"40,000 rotis a day: Modern kitchen for Ghaziabad's Dasna jail","GHAZIABAD: Dasna jail, which is overflowing with inmates, will undergo a revamp over the next few months. The UP government has approved a budget of Rs 2.25 crore to add more capacity to the jail. The money has been allocated for setting up a tubewell, network of water supply pipes and renovating the existing kitchen completely. Set up in 1993, Dasna jail currently is crowded almost three times its original capacity. The remaining 71 prisons across the state are packed 1.74 times their capacity on an average. During inspections by senior officials, the staff deputed for cooking food at Dasna frequently raised objections about amenities and hygiene. A proposal to modernise the kitchen was sent to the government along with a list of other work that needs to be done. The other prominent issue that the jail faces on a regular basis is water-logging. Acting on the proposal, the state government had on October 25 decided to set aside Rs 1.7 crore for renovating and construction of a new kitchen and Rs 54.42 lakh for other work. “Over Rs 54 lakh would be utilised for constructing a tubewell and laying down a network of water pipes. The rest of the money would be used for modernising the existing kitchen,” said Sharad, additional inspector-general of prisons (administration and reform services department). The officer added that funds to improve the drainage system so that water does not accumulate are also expected to be approved in the coming months.

The jail has about three dozen barracks. With improvement in drinking water supply and better hygiene in the kitchen, the prison would be able to bring down the rate of diseases that inmates suffer from, officials said. The list of tools and equipment that would be installed in the new kitchen includes a roti maker, vegetable chopper, seed cleaning machine and dough kneader, among others. According to sources, arguments break out among kitchen staff over making chapatis. Besides, in the past, clashes and brawls have taken place between inmates and prison guards over food quality across multiple prisons in the state. “Making 40,000 chapatis a day is a challenging task even for established caterers. A modern kitchen will solve a lot of these problems,” the officer said. "

Lucknow,Lucknow gasps for breath on most polluted day,"LUCKNOW: The city breathed uneasy on Wednesday with its air quality index (AQI) soaring to a new post-monsoon high of 326, which in pollution parlance is categorised as 'very poor'. Experts blamed accumulation of superfine particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5, owing to Diwali fireworks and vehicle pressure on roads, for this deterioration in air quality. Certain weather parameters - low temperature, high humidity and low wind velocity to be precise - aided retention of these pollutants, they said. SkipTrack the pollution level in your cityAccording to data shared by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Lucknow's AQI had turned 'poor' (between 201-300) in the second and third week of October.

""The concentration of pollutants increased gradually over the next two days because of conducive weather conditions. In other words, low temperature and slow winds."" Dutta maintained that the haze for the past three days was caused by accumulation of pollutants, held in place by the absence of gusty winds and moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea triggered by Cyclone Kyar.

According to the data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), AQI in Ghaziabad was 478, the highest in the country. Baghpat with AQI 461 was at fourth place, Noida (450) at fifth place, Greater Noida (438) at sixth and Hapur (435) seventh. Track the pollution level in your cityMeerut (430) and Bulandshahr (430) shared the eighth spot while Muzaffarnagar (428) was at ninth rank. Delhi was at the 10th place with AQI of 419. Two cities from Haryana-Panipat (475) and Ballabhgarh (467)- were at second and third place respectively. The pollution level in Haryana, UP and Delhi have been increasing since the second week of October, but they shot up significantly after Diwali. UP and Haryana cities have been among top 10 since. On Tuesday, four UP cities occupied top four slots in the country when for the first time, AQI levels crossed 400 (severe category) mark. A long exposure to this can cause serious health complications in people, particularly those suffering from heart and lung diseases. Experts said that besides stubble burning, bursting of firecrackers and increase in vehicular movement due to festive rush, besides conducive weather conditions were the reasons behind the spike. ""Air quality will only deteriorate in the coming days, as temperatures will drop further and moisture content in the atmosphere will increase. Absence of green corridors and unbridled construction activities are prominent reasons for deteriorating air quality. Authorities need to strictly implement measures recommended by the National Green Tribunal to check air pollution,"" said environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta. "
Lucknow,Wedding party? Send invite to Lucknow civic body for clean up job,"LUCKNOW: Preparing to get married? Apart from other arrangements, you will also have to invite or at least inform Lucknow Municipal Corporation to the event to ensure proper garbage management. People will have to inform LMC's zonal offices through a notice describing the exact location of the wedding and arrangements made for garbage disposal. If there is no provision for garbage management, the wedding organisers will have to ask the civic body to install dustbins and pay a fee to it. In the past, LMC has received several complaints from residents complaining about food leftovers, flowers, disposable glasses and other items dumped by organisers at wedding venues or in the open. These are often left unattended as the civic body has no information about it. The user fee charged by LMC will be decided on the quantity of garbage collected by the civic body. The rule is expected to get implemented from next month. An LMC official said, ""Information and minute points of the decision have been circulated in all zonal offices. Organisers will need to inform LMC at least a week before for arrangements.""

It may be mentioned that the regional pollution control board (RPCB) had ordered the closure of 267 tanneries before Kumbh but after Kumbh was over, it allowed 128 tanneries to operate.

Ghaziabad,Loni’s acid drums take care of Delhi’s e-waste but poison air,"GHAZIABAD: Just outside Delhi’s city limits and 20 km from Ghaziabad, the dormant industrial town of Loni is 15 points shy of breaching the 500-mark on the Air Quality Index (AQI). Yet, it marks a visible change from the other pollution hotspots of Ghaziabad. On Wednesday, with an AQI of 493, Sanjay Nagar was the most polluted spot in the city and the signs of an effort to make things better were visible. Not so in Loni. A few municipal workers collect dust by the road and there were no signs of the regular water sprinkling the administration claims to be doing. But there is more to Loni’s enduring air pollution problem than meets the eye. At first glance, the coal-based industrial belt — Tronica City, Roop Nagar Industrial Area and Arya Nagar Industrial Area — appears shut. There are no people, no buzz and no activity. But locals said the entire stretch comes alive at night. “Fumes from their chimneys fill the air at night,” said Mohit Chauhan, a local. Loni’s MLA, Nand Kishore Gujjar, concurred. “According to one estimate, there are more than 600 illegal units operating in Loni in areas like Amit Vihar, Krishna Vihar and Sewa Dham,” he said.

At night, several units across Loni’s unauthorised colonies begin their business day. E-waste is dipped in drums of acidic chemicals, which are then heated in pit furnaces to retrieve metal that can be resold,” said Pranav Rai, a Loni Nagar Palika official. He added, “The toxic fumes this generates leads to a sudden spike in PM10 levels and other pollutants in the vicinity. You don’t even need monitors to gauge the change – if you breathe in the air, you can feel the acrid fumes. And there are hundreds of such illegal units.” Latest CommentPeople and industry have to come together to fight the menace of pollution till the time it can be controlled. Once the levels go through the roof it would be extremely difficult to live in NCR towns.JASPREET SINGH OBEROISee All CommentsAdd commentBut with all officials apparently in the know, why has this gone unchecked? Locals allege those in charge of enforcement are hand in glove with offenders. “For something like this to go unchecked, officials and police have to be in connivance with the offenders,” Chauhan said. A Loni Nagar Palika official admitted to the limits of enforcement when it comes to these illegal units: “The factors at work in Loni are far too big for our enforcement mechanism to address. With little to no checks, illegal industrial units keep coming up at an alarming pace.” Others blame the lack of administrative support. “We have one team – with a magistrate, a pollution control board official and others – for the entire area. It is not possible to conduct raids in multiple places in one day … The shortage of personnel does inhibit how we function,” said Prakash Singh, tehsildar of Loni Nagar Palika. Yet, they have conducted 100 raids over the past month and lodged 37 FIRs against offenders. Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board regional officer, Utsav Sharma, claimed a bigger victory. “Since last year, we have shut 600 illegal polluting units in the Loni area,” he said. Gujjar, however, alleged that is an eyewash and “half of them are operating illegally at night” anyway. "
